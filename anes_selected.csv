He supports significant government intervention in healthcare and insurance.  He supports abortion to an unimaginable level.  He would raise taxes and burden small and large companies with more regulations, giving an advantage to our foreign competitors.  He seems like a chameleon.  His long-term record falls in line with whatever the political game of the day advocated, thus he has changed his opinion because it is not rooted in deep principles.  The double standard of the ""Me Too"" movement has somehow dismissed the legitimate possibility of a sexual assault claim, which seems to be a case that needs to be reconsidered.  His inability to articulate himself seems to clearly indicate, at his age, he is unfit for the job!

His foreign policy, including diplomatic and military, has been much more along the lines of a conservative than I initially expected.  His tax policy has also been beneficial.  Lowering rates to widen the base and raise revenue has been good.  His policy decisions regarding social issues has also been a nice surprise.  Perhaps the linchpin in voting for Trump in 2016 was his commitment to nominating textualist judges.  Although Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have not always interpreted the U.S. Constitution the way I do, I believe they are trying to be faithful to the meaning of the text.   The other large number of judges which have been nominated to lower courts has been reassuring.","He is negatively impacting our culture even if I believe he is implementing good government policies.  He behaves childishly at times, lashing out vindictively against political opponents, constantly tweeting unnecessarily, attacking public figures which should have little relevance, and overall helping to create an atmosphere of division, even if the seeds of it were sown before he entered office.  His questionable private life, deliberate pandering to various interest groups and subsets of his voting bloc (like ""evangelicals"") is distasteful.  Recently, he overstepped the constitutional authority granted to the president in Article II by issuing executive orders which rewrote tax code and compelled states to use money from their treasuries.  It seems like his decisions are largely based on the boundaries of his constitutional authority, but he also seems willing to overstep his constitutional authority when he thinks it is insignificant and will give him a political advantage.

This is a huge change in policy for the US.  Campaign promises made (""mexico will pay for the wall"") were not kept.  As a person - he seems to lack honor.

I sat and watched the President make one speech after another in 2016 about how he would never allow social security and medicare to be abandoned. I am tired of hearing congressmen, on both sides of the aisle, gert in frot of a microphone and proclaim that social security is such a drain on the federal budget! How system is toip heavy in receipants and will be broke in20 years. Sadly, there are people that actually believeit. It is the only federal program that runs in the black...becasue we are all required by law to pay into it by having our wages taxed. because congress and a number of presidents have seen this program as a cash cow and withdrawn $$money$$ from it and never replacd it, the fund is dwindling .

Black people cause their own problems because black men continue to father scores and scores of babies with black women and never stick around, so no family unit. This leaves scores of single black women raising upwards of 10 children at a time. That leads nowhere but to poverty and continues to cost the U.S. billions of dollars a year in welfare. If blacks want their lives to matter, black leaders need to step up and stop blaming society and starting taking a hard look at their own issues caused completely by black people themselves. Also, 1/2 to 2/3 of the black population is low-IQ, so no fix for that, just acceptance."

However, he runs away from this and acts as if he had little to do with it.  This running from his record, (a good act, in my opinion, save for the AWB) is concerning.  Add to that multiple acts of plagiarism (it cost him his 1st presidential campaign) and his public, threatening-violence-for-no-reason, temper flares, and I could not vote for him.","I support his accomplishments: tax cuts, revitalizing our military, supporting the middle/working class both in ethos and employment, seeking unilateral trade, addressing the China-US trade imbalance and, more importantly, the factors leading to that: China's theft of and refusal to recognize intellectual property rights, China's dumping of steel and other goods, China's use of slave labor (e.g. Uyghurs & Falun Gong in concentration camps), China's lack of environmental/labor/human rights/property rights laws which make for a very unfair playing field on which to trade--few have been willing to address China like Trump; he has addressed the mainstream media's near-complete bias against him (before he even took office) and fellow Republicans/Conservatives, his support of 2A, his recognition of countries' individual sovereignty, exemplified by building a wall at the Mexican-US border (and, again, unilateral trade deals); his appointment of Conservative/Originalist judges to the Federal Judiciary and SCOTUS, his candor--at times, as viewed by some, typically opponents, as brashness--and, when needed, bluntness; his willingness differ from members of his own party, management of Iran","I wish he would manage his Twitter feed in a slightly more genteel manner.  Moreover, rather than air grievances, I would he would address them with the person, either through immediate termination or meeting with them. Even as drastic as termination seems, I would prefer it to the psychodrama that his Twitter feed can be.  However, even within that, I do see a ""method to the madness,"" to borrow the quote.  I think his Twitter feed is used, extensively, to keep the mainstream media boxing at shadows since he knows their relationship has always been, and will always be, adversarial, at best.  I, personally, think the same could be accomplished while maintaining a veneer of civility.","At this moment, the largest issue is election fraud.  Too many cases of vote fraud, total ballots exceeding 100% in various states/counties/districts, ""found ballots"" that all are for Biden, mail-in/absentee ballots all for Biden when the predominant in-person vote was for Trump, Ilhan Omar's campaign found in possession of 1000+ ballots when 3 is the legal limit (and then, they only can be for the same address as the possessor), and *public* comments by powerful people in politics and media proclaiming victory and other statements indicating knowledge of a pre-determined outcome.  There is damning evidence both factual and circumstantial (the circumstantial is overwhelming) that this election was rife with fraud, if not outright engineered for fraud.Couple that with the Left's push to abolish 2nd Amendment freedoms, (publicly stated by Biden and Harris), which is the Amendment the Founders authored as the defense against Tyrannical Government/Authoritarian Government, and this is a downright *frightening* issue."

The electoral college process has become another joke in and of the judicial system and our government. Amendments and addendums needs to be added to our laws of process to grow with the times as society and technology changes.

Everything from the justice system to science to foreign affairs have been made a mockery of by Trump and I am ashamed that at 18 years old, I voted for him simply because I feared Hillary more. Though I cannot say that I necessarily disagree with my past logic, I wish I had had better options. As a [REDACTED OCCUPATION], I cannot believe that a leader would sit back and allow his country to become infested with COVID-19, then lie about it, and then fail to take care of those who are in need of assistance.","2.1.trump...trump’s cult 3.financial/ job crisis4.racism5.systemic and targeted oppression in regards to health, education and issues with law enforcement 6. law enforcement"

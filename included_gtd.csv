e_regionpol_6C,In which politico-geographic region is this country located?,Regions are described as politico-geographic in the sense that they are based on geographical proximity as well as characteristics that contribute to regional understanding as identified by scholars in studies of democratization (e.g. post-Communist). This is a modification of \emph{e\_regionpol} above.,NA
v2cltrnslw,"Are the laws of the land clear, well publicized, coherent (consistent with each other), relatively stable from year to year, and enforced in a predictable manner?",This question focuses on the transparency and predictability of the laws of the land.,"Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."

v2xme_altinf,"To what extent is the media (a) un-biased in their coverage or lack of coverage of the opposition, (b) allowed to be critical of the regime, and (c) representative of a wide array of political perspectives?",NA,"Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2clacfree,Is there academic freedom and freedom of cultural expression related to political issues?,NA,"Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2clkill,Is there freedom from political killings?,"Political killings are killings by the state or its agents without due process of law for the purpose of eliminating political opponents. These killings are the result of deliberate use of lethal force by the police, security forces, prison officials, or other agents of the state (including paramilitary groups).","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2clrspct,Are public officials rigorous and impartial in the performance of their duties?,"This question focuses on the extent to which public officials generally abide by the law and treat like cases alike, or conversely, the extent to which public administration is characterized by arbitrariness and biases (\textit{i.e.}, nepotism, cronyism, or discrimination). \\ 
The question covers the public officials that handle the cases of ordinary people. If no functioning public administration exists, the lowest score (0) applies.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2clfmove,Is there freedom of foreign travel and emigration?,This indicator specifies the extent to which citizens are able to travel freely to and from the country and to emigrate without being subject to restrictions by public authorities.,"Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2clprptyw,Do women enjoy the right to private property?,"Private property includes the right to acquire, possess, inherit, and sell private property, including land. Limits on property rights may come from the state (which may legally limit rights or fail to enforce them); customary laws and practices; or religious or social norms. This question concerns the right to private property, not actual ownership of property.\\ 
This question does not ask you to assess the \textit{relative} rights of men and women. Thus, it is possible to assign the lowest possible score to a country even if men and women enjoy equal --- and very minimal --- property rights.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2svdomaut,Is the state autonomous from the control of other states with respect to the conduct of domestic policy?,"The question of domestic autonomy does not include restrictions emanating from treaties (\textit{e.g.}, NATO), international organizations (\textit{e.g.}, the WTO), or confederations (\textit{e.g.}, the European Union) if these agreements are freely negotiated by the state and if the state is free to exit from that treaty, organization, or confederation. Nor does it include restrictions on policymaking emanating from international market forces and trans-national corporations.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2xnp_regcorr,To what extent do political actors use political office for private or political gain?,"In systems of neopatrimonial rule, politicians use their offices for private and/or political gain. This index relates closely to V-Dem's political corruption index (v2x\_corr), but focuses on a more specific set of actors – those who occupy political offices - and a more specific set of corrupt acts that relate more closely to the conceptualization of corruption in literature on neopatrimonial rule. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2xpe_exlsocgr,Index of (political) exclusion by social group,"Exclusion is when individuals are denied access to services or participation in governed spaces (spaces that are part of the public space and the government should regulate, while excluding private spaces and organizations except when exclusion in those private spheres is linked to exclusion in the public sphere)  based on their identity or belonging to a particular group. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)"

v2meharjrn,"Are individual journalists harassed --- \textit{i.e.}, threatened with libel, arrested, imprisoned, beaten, or killed --- by governmental or powerful nongovernmental actors while engaged in legitimate journalistic activities?",NA,"Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2pepwrsoc,Is political power distributed according to social groups?,"A social group is differentiated within a country by caste, ethnicity, language, race, region, religion, or some combination thereof. (It does \textit{not} include identities grounded in sexual orientation or socioeconomic status.) Social group identity is contextually defined and is likely to vary across countries and through time. Social group identities are also likely to cross-cut, so that a given person could be defined in multiple ways, \textit{i.e.}, as part of multiple groups. Nonetheless, at any given point in time there are social groups within a society that are understood --- by those residing within that society --- to be different, in ways that may be politically relevant.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2dlencmps,"Considering the profile of social and infrastructural spending in the national budget, how ""particularistic"" or ""public goods"" are most expenditures?","Particularistic spending is narrowly targeted on a specific corporation, sector, social group, region, party, or set of constituents. Such spending may be referred to as ""pork"", ""clientelistic"", or ""private goods.""\\ 
Public-goods spending is intended to benefit all communities within a society, though it may be means-tested so as to target poor, needy, or otherwise underprivileged constituents. The key point is that all who satisfy the means-test are allowed to receive the benefit. \\ 
Your answer should consider the entire budget of social and infrastructural spending. We are interested in the relative value of particularistic and public-goods spending, not the number of bills or programs that fall into either category.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2xel_frefair,To what extent are elections free and fair?,"Free and fair connotes an absence of registration fraud, systematic irregularities, government intimidation of the opposition, vote buying, and election violence.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2elsnlsff,Does the freeness and fairness of subnational elections vary across different areas of the country?,"Subnational elections refer to elections to regional or local offices, as specified above.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2xdl_delib,To what extent is the deliberative principle of democracy achieved?,"The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions—as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levels—from preference formation to final decision—among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. \\ 
To measure these features of a polity we try to determine the extent to which political elites give public justifications for their positions on matters of public policy, justify their positions in terms of the public good, acknowledge and respect counter-arguments; and how wide the range of consultation is at elite levels.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2xeg_eqdr,How equal is the distribution of resources?,"This component measures the extent to which resources --- both tangible and intangible --- are distributed in society.  An equal distribution of resources supports egalitarian democracy in two ways. First, lower poverty rates and the distribution of goods and services such as food, water, housing, education and healthcare ensure that all individuals are capable of participating in politics and government. In short, basic needs must be met in order for individuals to effectively exercise their rights and freedoms see, for example, Sen 1999, Maslow 1943. Second, high levels of resource inequality undermine the ability of poorer populations to participate meaningfully Aristotle, Dahl 2006.  Thus, it is necessary to include not only measures of poverty and the distribution of goods and services, but also the levels of inequality in these distributions, and the proportion of the population who are not eligible for social services \textit{i.e.} means-tests, particularistic distribution, etc.. This principle also implies that social or economic inequalities can translate into political inequalities, an issue addressed most notably by Walzer 1983, who argues that overlapping ""spheres"" of inequality are particularly harmful to society. To address these overlapping ""spheres"", this component also includes measures of the distribution of power in society amongst different socio-economic groups, genders, etc.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2clpolcl,"Do members of all political groups enjoy the same level of civil liberties, or are some groups generally in a more favorable position?","A political group is defined as those who are affiliated with a particular political party or candidate, or a group of parties/candidates that can be distinguished from others in terms of enjoyment of civil liberties. Responses should not reflect which party controls the legislature and executive. Here, civil liberties are understood to include access to justice, private property rights, freedom of movement, and freedom from forced labor.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2peedueq,"To what extent is high quality basic education guaranteed to all, sufficient to enable them to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens?",Basic education refers to ages typically between 6 and 16 years of age but this varies slightly among countries.,"Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2peasbgen,Are state business opportunities equally available to qualified individuals or firms regardless of gender?,"State business opportunities refer to the ability to compete for or receive a public procurement contract, to partner with the government in public-private partnerships, etc.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2smpolsoc,How would you characterize the differences of opinions on major political issues in this society?,"While plurality of views exists in all societies, we are interested in knowing the extent to which these differences in opinions result in major clashes of views and polarization or, alternatively, whether there is general agreement on the general direction this society should develop.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2xpe_exlgender,Index of (political) exclusion by gender,"Exclusion is when individuals are denied access to services or participation in governed spaces (spaces that are part of the public space and the government should regulate, while excluding private spaces and organizations except when exclusion in those private spheres is linked to exclusion in the public sphere)  based on their identity or belonging to a particular group. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic).

v2cacamps,"Is society polarized into antagonistic, political camps?","Here we refer to the extent to which political differences affect social relationships beyond political discussions. Societies are highly polarized if supporters of opposing political camps are reluctant to engage in friendly interactions, for example, in family functions, civic associations, their free time activities and workplaces","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2caassemb,To what extent do state authorities respect and protect the right of peaceful assembly?,"This question focuses on the ability to assemble publically in practice. An assembly is “an intentional and temporary presence of a number of individuals in a public place, for a common expressive purpose” (ODIHR and Venice Commission of the Council of Europe 2010). Authorities may limit the right to assembly only if limitations are necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and are lawful, necessary, and proportionate to the aim pursued. Such reasonable and legal restrictions should not be considered when answering. However, if there is evidence that restrictions are used as a pretext for political reasons, this evidence should be considered.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2caautmob,"In this year, how frequent and large have events of mass mobilization for pro-autocratic aims been?","Events are pro-autocratic if they are organized explicitly in support of non-democratic rulers and forms of government such as a one-party state, monarchy, theocracy or military dictatorships. Events are also pro-autocratic if they are organized in support of leaders that question basic principles of democracy, or are generally are aiming to undermine democratic ideas and institutions such as the rule of law, free and fair elections, or media freedom. This question concerns the mobilization of citizens for mass events such as demonstrations, strikes, sit. These events are typically organized by non-state actors, but the question also concerns also count state-orchestrated rallies (e.g. to show support of an autocratic government).","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2castate,"What share of the population is regularly active in state-administered mass associations, such as women, worker or youth leagues?","State-administered mass associations are civilian organizations created and led by the government or the ruling party. Large shares of specific societal groups are voluntary or compulsory members of these associations. Examples include youth leagues such as the Hitlerjugend in Nazi Germany and the pioneers in the Soviet Union, women leagues such as the Women’s Federation in China or the Federacion de Mujeres Cubanas and official trade unions in the Soviet Union. Such organizations are formally or informally affiliated with the state and/or with the ruling party. We consider an individual as active if they attend a meeting, activity or event at least twice a year.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2csantimv,"Among civil society organizations, are there anti-system opposition movements?","An anti-system opposition movement is any movement --- peaceful or armed --- that is based in the country (not abroad) and is organized in opposition to the current political system. That is, it aims to change the polity in fundamental ways, \textit{e.g.}, from democratic to autocratic (or vice-versa), from capitalist to communist (or vice-versa), from secular to fundamentalist (or vice-versa). This movement may be linked to a political party that competes in elections but it must also have a ""movement"" character, which is to say a mass base and an existence separate from normal electoral competition.\\ 
If there are several movements, please answer in a general way about the relationship of those movements to the regime.","Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2lginvstp,"If the executive were engaged in unconstitutional, illegal, or unethical activity, how likely is it that a legislative body (perhaps a whole chamber, perhaps a committee, whether aligned with government or opposition) would conduct an investigation that would result in a decision or report that is unfavorable to the executive?",NA,"Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model."
v2xcl_disc,Are citizens able to openly discuss political issues in private homes and in public spaces?,"This indicator specifies the extent to which citizens are able to engage in private discussions, particularly on political issues, in private homes and public spaces restaurants, public transportation, sports events, work etc. without fear of harassment by other members of the polity or the public authorities. We are interested in restrictions by the government and its agents but also cultural restrictions or customary laws that are enforced by other members of the polity, sometimes in informal ways.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2elsuffrage,What percentage (\%) of adult citizens (as defined by statute) has the legal right to vote in national elections?,"This question does not take into consideration restrictions based on age, residence, having been convicted for crime, being in the military service or being legally incompetent. It covers legal (\textit{de jure}) restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice (\textit{de facto}). The adult population (as defined by statute) is defined by citizens in the case of independent countries or the people living in the territorial entity in the case of colonies. \\ 
Universal suffrage is coded as 100\%. Universal male suffrage is only coded as 50\%. Years before electoral provisions are introduced are scored 0\%. The scores do not reflect whether an electoral regime was interrupted or not. Only if new constitutions, electoral laws, or the like explicitly introduce new regulations of suffrage, the scores were adjusted accordingly if the changes suggested doing so. If qualifying criteria other than gender apply (such as property, tax payments, income, literacy, region, race, ethnicity, religion, and/or 'economic independence'), estimates have been calculated by combining information on the restrictions with different kinds of statistical information (on population size, age distribution, wealth distribution, literacy rates, size of ethnic groups, etc.), secondary country-specific sources, and --- in the case of very poor information --- the conditions in similar countries or colonies.\\ 
The scores reflect \textit{de jure} provisions of suffrage extension in percentage of the adult population. If the suffrage law is revised in a way that affects the extension, the scores reflect this change as of the calendar year the law was enacted.",Interval.

A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions—as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levels—from preference formation to final decision—among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. To make it a measure of not only the deliberative principle but also of democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2xcl_rol,"To what extent are laws transparent and rigorously enforced and public administration impartial, and to what extent do citizens enjoy access to justice, secure property rights, freedom from forced labor, freedom of movement, physical integrity rights, and freedom of religion?",NA,"Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2x_egaldem,To what extent is the ideal of egalitarian democracy achieved?,"The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate.  Egalitarian democracy is achieved when 1 rights and freedoms of individuals are protected equally across all social groups; and 2 resources are distributed equally across all social groups; 3 groups and individuals enjoy equal access to power.   To make it a measure of egalitarian democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2x_elecreg,"At this time, are regularly scheduled national elections on course, as stipulated by election law or well-established precedent?","Coded 0 until an executive or legislative election is held, defined by v2xel\_elecpres and v2xel\_elecparl, then set to 1 until any of the following two events occur (if they occur): (a) that the election was ""aborted"", meaning that those elected did not resume power,  as defined by v2x\_hosabort and v2x\_legabort; or (b) an ""electoral interruption"", meaning that either the legislature was shut down, as defined by v2xlg\_leginter, or there was an executive coup, as defined by v2x\_hosinter; in the case of (a) or (b), v2x\_elecreg is set to 0 until there is another election. The operational indicator of an ”aborted” executive election (v2x\_hosabort) is that v2expathhs did not turn 7 within 12 months after the election, for a legislative election (v2x\_legabort) that v2lgbicam did not turn positive within 12 months after the election. An interruption of the electoral regime occurring through the HOS, \textit{e.g.} a coup d’état, is indicated by v2x\_hosinter as a change in v2xel\_elecpres, meaning v2expathhs turned from 7 to something else, with the exception of 6, approval by the legislature (in case the legislature remained in place). An interruption of the electoral regime occurring through the legislature is defined by v2xlg\_leginter based on v2lgbicam turning 0. We note that the coding of v2x\_elecreg does not merely follow mechanically from the scores on these other variables, as the coding of v2x\_elecreg has also been cross-checked and validated by research assistants. An executive and a legislative electoral regime cannot be separated since they form an integral part, where an aborted legislature is interpreted as a signal that also the executive is not standing for election any longer, and vice versa.",Dichotomous.

v2elrsthos,"Is the eligibility of candidates for the office of head of state (when elected) formally restricted (by constitution or statute) by ethnicity, race, religion, or language?","Language restriction should be understood as a restriction of spoken language, not literacy.",Dichotomous.
v2svindep,Is the polity an independent state?,"We use Gleditsch and Ward's (1999) coding of independent states. Their definition recognizes that listing independent states relies at least in part on subjective evaluations. A state is considered to be an independent polity if it (a) has a relatively autonomous administration over some territory, (b) is considered a distinct entity by local actors or the state it is dependent on. Polities excluded from the list are: colonies; states that have some form of limited autonomy (\textit{e.g.} Scotland); are alleged to be independent but are contiguous to the dominant entity (Ukraine and Belarus prior to 1991); \textit{de facto} independent polities but recognized by at most one other state (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus). Occupations or foreign rule are considered to be an actual loss of statehood when they extend beyond a decade. This means that cases such as the Baltic Republic during Soviet occupation are not considered independent states, but independent statehood is retained for European countries occupied during World War II.",Dichotomous.
v2x_pubcorr,"To what extent do public sector employees grant favors in exchange for bribes, kickbacks, or other material inducements, and how often do they steal, embezzle, or misappropriate public funds or other state resources for personal or family use?","The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."

v2x_clphy,To what extent is physical integrity respected?,"Physical integrity is understood as freedom from political killings and torture by the government. Among the set of civil liberties, these liberal rights are the most relevant for political competition and accountability. The index is based on indicators that reflect violence committed by government agents and that are not directly referring to elections.","Interval, from low to high (0-1)."
v2x_accountability,To what extent is the ideal of government accountability achieved?,"Government accountability is understood as constraints on the government's use of political power through requirements for justification for its actions and potential sanctions. We organize the sub-types of accountability spatially. Vertical accountability refers to the ability of a state's population to hold its government accountable through elections, horizontal accountability refers to checks and balances between institutions; and diagonal accountability captures oversight by civil society organizations and media activity.","We provide two versions of this index. The first is the normalized output from the the hierarchical latent variable analysis. It is on an unbounded interval scale. The second, denoted by *_osp, is a version of this output which we scale using a standard normal cumulative distribution function. It is thus scaled low to high (0-1)."
v2xcl_prpty,Do citizens enjoy the right to private property?,"Private property includes the right to acquire, possess, inherit, and sell private property, including land.

v2peapssoc,"Are basic public services, such as order and security, primary education, clean water, and healthcare, distributed equally across social groups?","This question asks if social group is an important cleavage in society for the distribution of public services. Thus, if there are inequalities in access to public services, but these are not mainly due to differentiation between particular social groups, the code should be “4” (equal). The situation could of course vary by type of public service, such that a social group is denied access to some basic public services but not others.

v2x_egal,To what extent is the egalitarian principle achieved?,"The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate.

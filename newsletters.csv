This issue: XR Vaal vs Coal Mines | France’s Water War part II | Oil Kills Dear rebel, Renown climate scientist Johan Rockström has given an updated assessment of our planet, and his verdict is terrifying. The Earth is heating quicker than scientists expected, the planetary systems that absorb heat are already showing signs of overwhelm, and irreversible cataclysmic tipping points are on our doorstep. Rockström ends on a note of positivity (this is a TED talk) by affirming that the majority of citizens across the world care about the planet and want solutions to this crisis, and those solutions are available - we just have to use them. Except we don’t. We trundle on towards the abyss, seemingly uninterested in cheaper green energy and circular economies. While Rockström doesn’t mention this paradox, let alone explain it, he does show the reason for it on a slide… Rockström shows this slide but doesn’t discuss it. We’re top of the list. Photo: TED To avert disaster, we need to see the fastest economic transition in history. But capitalism has created vast inequality, meaning too much power is in the hands of a small elite that would rather sustain their privileges under the current economy than sustain life under a new one. So instead of political progress we get COP, instead of technological disruption we get carbon capture and AI, and instead of market forces we get fossil fuel subsidies of more than $7tn globally. Which just leaves us, mass movements. We are the one remaining driver of economic transition that this elite hasn’t extinguished - though they are certainly trying, as the recent 5-year imprisonment of an XR co-founder demonstrates. French police fire so many tear gas grenades at peaceful protesters, they set fire to fields… again. In this issue, we show how activists are pushing against the ecocidal confines of capitalism. In Action Highlights we report on the South African rebels who are refusing to have more dirty coal mines on their doorstep, despite the promise of new jobs, and we investigate how an alliance of activists in France are using genius tactics to disrupt the privatisation of their water. For Solidarity Corner we celebrate Oil Kills, an exciting new global collective that includes XR groups, and has disrupted airports around the world in an effort to get governments to sign a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. Shortly after Rockström’s speech, Roger Hallam, the imprisoned co-founder of XR, made a statement over a prison phoneline. In it, he framed his activism as not being against climate change, but against “the biggest death project in human history”. That death project has already begun, and it is about to get much worse, much quicker than we thought. Capitalism is its engine, and we must resist it in every way we can. Hundreds of millions of lives are in the balance. This newsletter is available in multiple languages. Use the globe icon (top right) to change language.

Photo: Alex Patrick/News 24 XR Vaal and other local activists held a funeral for their land, air, and water outside Canyon Coal, a company planning two new open-cast coal mines in their already heavily-polluted region. When security forced the rebels to move away from the company entrance and instead gather in a cul-de-sac at the back, the protesters took the opportunity to form a sombre procession through the streets of Johannesburg, drawing many more onlookers and enraging Canyon executives. A startled chief executive still came out to receive a list of demands about the proposed coal mines, which were sourced from the many residents of the Vaal Triangle whose lives will be severely disrupted by the project. Some will live within 200m of the mines. Rebel demands are handed to a Canyon Coal executive. Photo: Julia Evans/Daily Maverick Rebel demands included more stringent environmental and health protections for those living and working nearby, a long-term waste management plan, and greater transparency from a company that has not properly consulted local residents. The mines will use precious groundwater to wash 1.7 trillion tonnes of coal per day, depleting and potentially poisoning the region’s drinking water, and destroying receding wetlands. Nearby buildings, which include schools, risk structural damage from blasting, and Vaal’s air, already some of the most polluted in South Africa, can only get worse. Many locals suffer respiratory diseases after decades of intensive fossil fuel spewing industry in the area. Canyon Coal are promising the mines will provide local jobs, but they will not outnumber those lost once farms and other businesses are forced to relocate. Locals have organised against the mines since their proposal in 2019. If green lit, they will extract coal for approximately 30 years. Photo: Alex Patrick/News 24 Residents throughout the region are unified in opposing Canyon Coal’s plans, which have been submitted to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy for final clearance. XR Vaal are reaching out to other local groups, and planning a visit to the ministry in Pretoria. Rebels wrote a letter to the minister involved back in 2022 when local children were being injured and even killed falling into disused open mining shafts. That letter was ignored, but this time, the rebels will be making their demands in person. Follow XR Vaal’s campaign on Facebook. 16–21 JULY | Melle, Saint-Sauvant, La Rochelle, France A kite carrying duckweed flies off to clog a commercial water reservoir. In alliance with XR and other activist movements, Les Soulèvements de la terre (‘Earth Uprisings’) organised six days of action to protest huge state-funded water reservoirs being constructed by agribusinesses in France. The French interior minister tried yet failed to dissolve the collective after similar protests in 2023, but the expansion of these massive privatised water stores has continued, so the disruption has too. The vast plastic-lined reservoirs (‘mégabassines’) hoard water in a wasteful and ecologically harmful way, but ensure that big agricultural corporations have year-round irrigation, at the expense of small-scale farmers and local communities. This is becoming an ever more urgent problem in France as climate breakdown generates higher temperatures, and more frequent and intense droughts. An assembly in the Water Village on the second day of the campaign. The new wave of resistance had a Water Village as their base. Constructed in a field in western France, the encampment provided everything from free catering and childcare, to music and discussion spaces. The inhabitants met up with thousands more activists from across the country to stage protests in several nearby locations. For the first action, around 10,000 activists marched to a commercial reservoir owned by a major agriculture company. Hundreds of police descended on the site, firing so many tear gas grenades that a wheat field caught fire. Despite the chaos, a group of activists on bicycles, led by Naturalistes des terres, still managed to deploy butterfly-shaped kites to drop duckweed into the water – a fast-growing plant that can easily invade and block water pipes and pumping systems. The protest shifted from reservoirs to a port at La Rochelle, the site of another damaging practice of agribusiness: exporting grain for animal feed, which causes ecological and social harm on multiple levels. Farmers driving tractors, and thousands of activists on foot, bike and boat, arrived at dawn to blockade the port. Les Soulèvements de la terre are emphatic that farmers, who have far more in common with citizens than with corporate agribusiness, are not the enemy. Farmers, rebels and other activists march to La Rochelle to blockade the port. Throughout the campaign, the police were a large and aggressive presence. They ID’d activists both on their way to the Water Village and within it, and beat marchers with batons in the port, leaving many with severe injuries, though not as many as in the previous campaign in 2023. Stopping the expansion of these reservoirs – and diminishing the dominance of massive commercial agriculture – is a hard fight that is only getting harder as the far right rise in France. A recent arson attack on a ZAD protest site saw an activist held at knife point as their car was set on fire. But this activist alliance is not backing down. They will now mount legal challenges, alongside direct actions. Find out more about XR France and Les Soulèvements de la terre 6 JULY | The Hague, Netherlands & Belgrade, Serbia: XR Netherlands resumes its glorious blockade of the A12 motorway, demanding an end to fossil fuel subsidies. Police immediately used water cannon to disperse the protesters, which included medics, scientists, an orchestra and Greta Thunberg, but they stayed put. So police arrested them and drove them away in buses. XR Serbia protested outside the Dutch embassy in Belgrade in solidarity with their rebel comrades. 7 JULY | Quito, Ecuador: Victory! A court rules that pollution violates the rights of a river that runs through Quito. The Machángara River is dead after 100 years of abuse, but thanks to local ecoactivists, and a clause in the Ecuadorian constitution which affords rights to natural features, the court has ruled that the government must now clean it up. The government is appealing. 8 JULY | New York City, USA: The Lamentors silently shuffle from California to New York City to take part in the “Summer of Heat on Wall Street” campaign - an ongoing protest at the HQ of Citibank, the world’s largest funder of fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement. The rebel mourners were arrested for blockading the bank, but still returned days later to stare at its staff as they arrived for work. Around 4,000 activists have taken part in the peaceful blockades since they started in early June, and at least 475 have been arrested, many on ridiculous grounds, like the musician who faces 7 years in jail for playing the cello. Bank security have assaulted protesters, while executives have called for them to be machine-gunned. Photo: Ken Schles 9 JULY | Bologna, Italy: Rebels occupy Bologna’s city hall on the first day of a G7 Science and Technology meeting, chaining themselves across its entrance and dropping a banner from its roof. Police shoved activists, smashed their phones, and held 20 in police custody for 7 hours without food or water. One female rebel was subjected to a full and completely unwarranted strip search. 9 JULY | Newcastle, Australia: Blockade Australia finish the longest ever consecutive blockade of the world's biggest coal port. The 30 activists who occupied coal trains and suspended themselves over rail tracks across 15 days are now receiving significant fines and months of prison time. You can hear from two of them about why they took part in this podcast episode. 11 JULY | Dublin, Ireland: While thousands prepared to run through the city, XR Ireland held a rally to denounce J.P. Morgan, the sponsor of the Docklands 5k race, for its colossal and continuous financing of fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement. Thanks to the bank's dirty investments, the race route will be underwater within the lifetime of its runners. 18 JULY | London, UK: A judge passes the UK’s longest sentences in living memory on five Just Stop Oil activists for planning to peacefully disrupt a motorway. One activist, a co-founder of XR, was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment, the others 4 years. None were allowed to mention climate change in their defence, and when all but one did so anyway, they were re-arrested and imprisoned. The UN Special Rapporteur on Environmental Defenders called it a very dark day for human rights. Weeks later, 5 more Just Stop Oil activists were imprisoned, meaning 26 people are currently imprisoned in the UK for non-violent climate protest. 29 & 30 JULY | Linz, Austria: Rebels and members of Last Generation blockade a major road through Linz in multiple locations on two consecutive days to protest the construction of the A26 motorway. Activists used banners, chains, tripods and armlocks to disrupt rush-hour traffic, reminding drivers that more roads create more traffic. Four rebels were arrested, with one was taken into custody. Austria has not reduced its greenhouse gas emissions since 1990, yet fossil fuel mega-projects continue to get state backing. 2 AUGUST | Limbe, Cameroon: XR Cameroon mobilises in the coastal city of Limbe to raise awareness about the immense damage fossil fuels and plastic waste inflict on human and marine life. Rebels visited local petrol stations and launched a thorough beach clean-up, sorting the vast amount of plastic waste for recycling. 6 AUGUST | La Paz, Bolivia: Rebels stage a funeral march for Bolivian wildlife, wearing animal masks and holding up coffins. The Amazonian country has been ravaged by record forest fires, with the regions of Santa Cruz and Beni most devastated. Forest fires are not natural tragedies in Bolivia, but a tool of agribusiness and cattle ranchers to clear forest land for profit, often with the blessings of the state. XR Bolivia demanded justice for the Amazon, and a proper fire prevention plan from their government. 8 AUGUST | Port Harcourt, Nigeria: Scientist Rebellion Nigeria take to the street of Port Harcourt, a city in the oil rich Niger Delta, to demand that the government, banks and insurance companies stop investing in fossil fuels. The 30 activists called for more biodiversity and fewer oil and gas billionaires. 11 AUGUST | North Kivu, DRC: Despite continuing violence in the region by a Rwanda & Uganda backed militia, XR Rutshuru bravely continue their campaign to educate locals about the looming threat of oil and gas extraction, both to their livelihoods and the nearby Virunga National Park. 14 AUGUST | Wanda, Argentina: XR Misiones visit the Ministry of Ecology to condemn Arauco, a forestry company that’s planted vast pine forests in the region and colluded with the state to violently evict indigenous families from their land. The rebels were accompanied by an indigenous family - one of two to have their homes and crops bulldozed and burnt to the ground by state police and Arauco staff. Family members were beaten and tortured, while their livestock were killed or stolen. XR Misiones have launched a media campaign to demand justice for the families and an end to Arauco’s violent monoculture business. Their alien pine forests grow fast but drain groundwater, kill biodiversity and leave locals with respiratory diseases from the pollen. 24 JULY - ONGOING | Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uganda, UK, USA Oil Kills actions in Spain, USA, and two in Canada (bottom). The tactics vary, but the central demand, and non-violent ethos, remains constant around the world. A new international coalition of activist groups, including XR Boston, XR Sweden, XR Finland, XR Netherlands, and Scientist Rebellion groups are disrupting airports to make one demand - the adoption of a treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030. Under the banner Oil Kills, small groups of activists have occupied airport departure lounges, plane cabins, terminals, and roads across three continents – and they aren’t done yet. Here’s the numbers so far: 500 people, 31 airports, 22 groups, 144 arrests, 22 people in prison – all in support of their one demand. The new coalition formed when members of XR, the A22 Network, and Stay Grounded began reaching out to other groups globally. What resulted was an alliance of civil resistance groups focused on the sustained disruption of airports – a key pillar of the fossil fuel economy. All participants are committed to non-violence and the key demand – but from there individual creativity and context has led to an array of tactics: from airport glue-ins, to plane occupations, to spray-painting terminals, to street marches. Police arrest an activist who reached the Ugandan Parliament. Photo: Busein Samilu After the initial whirlwind of actions in July, with 37 arrests over the first two days alone, disruptions continued steadily across three continents, with especially relentless activity in Germany. On August 9th, Students Against EACOP Uganda joined the Oil Kills campaign, planning a peaceful march to the parliament in Kampala and the delivery of a petition demanding an end to the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, and for their government to sign the treaty to end fossil fuels. But the police mounted roadblocks to stop the march from starting, and arrested 45 student activists and three bus drivers on arrival. Two remaining students regrouped and managed to reach the parliament building before being violently arrested. More Oil Kills actions in (Clockwise from top left) Switzerland, UK, Austria and Spain. “The resilience under extreme repression shown by Students Against EACOP is an inspiration and metaphor for the Oil Kills movement,” said a coalition member. “We refuse to die.” Oil Kills welcomes large and small groups to join their coalition. As a rebel with XR Boston explained, “there have been actions where small groups or even lone activists have held up an Oil Kills banner and received media coverage and support because they are part of a global campaign which can’t be ignored. You can make a big impact. We urge more local groups to get involved.” Learn more about Oil Kills and use this Solidarity Toolkit to spread their message.

This issue: Finland’s Storm Warning | UK’s Restore Nature Now | XR Argentina | Dear rebel, If people stage a protest but the media isn’t around to record it, can it have an impact? The Restore Nature Now march in London was the world’s largest-ever eco-march, an incredible collaboration between 100,000 activists drawn from 300 organisations, yet media coverage was light, and the BBC ignored it. Is this the price of prioritising accessibility over disruption? You can find out more about the record-breaking day, and what XR UK will try next, in Action Highlights. Finnish rebels withstand police violence during street blockades in Helsinki. There, you can also read about how Finnish rebels staged the biggest disobedience campaign in their nation’s history. Thousands attended multiple street blockades to end ecocidal subsidies. But while the disruption brought precious media attention, it also brought so much police violence that one blockade had to be suspended. Finally, in Humans of XR we hear from an inspiring rebel in Argentina, a country where dead marine life is washing up on beaches because of seismic testing for offshore oil, and the right to protest against it is being eroded with terrifying speed.

Donate What You Can 7, 11, 25, 28, 30 JUNE | Helsinki, Finland Rebels blockade a street in Helsinki. The sign: Rise Up in Rebellion. Finnish rebels issued their right-wing government with a ‘Storm Warning’ in the form of the biggest act of collective civil disobedience in the country’s history. Elokapina (XR Finland) hoped to see a thousand rebels turn up, but instead saw around 3000 take to the streets of Helsinki and call for urgent government action on subsidies that are exacerbating the climate emergency. On five distinct days, protesters turned out to march, set up camp outside the national parliament, and block traffic on some of the city’s busiest roads. They included families, students, and elderly people, city dwellers and rural folk, experienced activists and first-timers, and global icons like Greta Thunberg, who spoke on the parliament’s steps before being arrested for joining a traffic blockade. 100 rebels spend the night outside parliament after police confiscate their tents. The Storm Warning came with four clear demands of the Finnish government: report all subsidies given out each year; abolish all subsidies damaging the climate and environment; establish a Citizens’ Forum to decide eco-policies; and ensure a just transition prioritising those most affected by climate and ecological destruction. Finland is not itself a fossil fuel-producing nation, but it continues to grant huge subsidies to fossil-fuel companies, even as it imposes austerity on its population. The police response was more aggressive than with previous campaigns. On the opening day, rebels slept in front of the Supreme Court with only their sleeping bags to warm them after the police confiscated their tents. Officers sank to outright violence to clear a traffic blockade on the penultimate day of action. They dragged protesters along the tarmac, pinned them with their knees, put a legal observer in a chokehold, and struck one rebel over the head without provocation. Around 100 rebels were arrested and will be issued with court fines. Rebels mass outside Helsinki’s Parliament House during the Storm Warning. The campaign has attracted a lot of media attention, and strong public backing. Filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki sent Elokapina an open letter pledging to cover any fines that might have to be paid after the actions. Inspired by their Dutch counterparts, Elokapina have been forging stronger links with global XR groups, as well as the international struggle for Palestinian liberation. Energised by Storm Warning’s large turnout, undeterred by the police crackdown, and determined to make their government take action, Elokapina are now ready to turn up the heat. Their next protest, ‘Boiling Point’, will take place in early September when the national budget is announced. Follow Elokapina on their website, X, Instagram or Facebook. 22 JUNE | London, UK A blue tit soars over the world’s biggest ever march for nature in London. It was the largest march for nature ever seen! Over 100,000 rebels and other eco-activists marched through central London, delivering a clear message to politicians as they campaigned for a General Election to Restore Nature Now! The march was not just bigger than The Big One, the 3-day London rebellion in 2023 where attendance was prioritised over disruption. It brought together the world’s largest ever collection of community and environmental groups. Over 300 took part, from the more radical Just Stop Oil to the well-established National Trust. The march featured Hollywood stars and Amazonian leaders. Years of preparation by XR UK has made this march a reality. A special highlight of the day was the speech given by Nemonte Nenquimo, an Indigenous activist who won a historic legal battle to protect 2000 square kilometres of Amazon rainforest. Despite its monumental size, the march was not covered at all by the BBC, with the UK’s national broadcaster deciding to report on a selfie by Taylor Swift instead. Other broadcasters did cover the historic day, but the media exposure was a fraction of a two-person Just Stop Oil action just days earlier. A butterfly spreads its glorious wings outside the Houses of Parliament. Despite this, XR UK will continue to stage mass actions that avoid disrupting the public, and limit disruptive tactics to specific targets like ecocidal companies and government buildings. The focus right now is on the Upgrade Democracy action, which will see rebels occupy the royal park outside Windsor Castle to demand a citizens’ assembly on climate. A special shoutout goes out to the Disabled Rebels team, who met disabled rebels at London train stations with wheelchairs and vegan snacks, guided them along the route, and ensured that the march was the most accessible XR action ever. Follow XR UK on their website, X, Instagram or Facebook. 4 JUNE | Buenos Aires, Argentina & Stavanger, Norway: A new Atlanticazo wave has started across Argentina, with protesters marching against offshore oil drilling and seismic testing along the country’s coastline. To mark the occasion, rebels performed an ‘Under the Sea’ dance to homemade musical instruments. Meanwhile, Scientist Rebellion Norway rallied outside the headquarters of Equinor, an oil company planning to drill in the Argentine sea and whose seismic testing is causing dead animals to wash up on the country’s shores. The sea is not for sale! 5 JUNE | Bogotá, Colombia: Rebels march to defend local wetlands against a vast new road that would cross the capital and destroy three precious green areas. 8 JUNE | Toulouse, France: 6,000 opponents of the planned A69 motorway, including rebels, defy a ban on demonstrations to march along its route and block its construction. Police used water cannons, tear gas grenades, and armoured vehicles to try and stop the procession, injuring 20 activists. Locals helped the wounded, gave out water, and allowed protesters to use their gardens to avoid police barricades. 13 JUNE | Seoul, South Korea: Victory! The Supreme Court dismisses charges against rebels after a three-year trial. In March 2021, rebels chained themselves to the ruling party headquarters in response to the passage of a special law allowing construction of a new airport. XR South Korea have vowed to intensify protests against the airport. 14 JUNE | Mexico City, Mexico: 15 Scientist Rebellion activists join Debt4Cimate to protest outside offices of the World Bank to denounce the G7 and call for Global South debts to be forgiven. The G7 uses huge loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to colonise the economies of the Global South, forcing nations to extract resources and commit ecocide to stay solvent. 16 JUNE | Bari, Italy: Dozens of rebels and activists with Debt 4 Climate blockade the entrance to the G7 International Media Center, home to more than a thousand journalists from all over the world covering the summit. They condemned the media for its silence as the G7 downplayed the spiralling global climate collapse. One rebel was hospitalised when police pulled at a chain around his neck and suffocated him. 18 JUNE | Nyiragongo, DRC: XR Rutshuru visit a makeshift refugee camp on the outskirts of Virunga National Park where people displaced by the armed conflict in DRC are living. The rebels explained the dire consequences of allowing fossil fuel projects in the region and the need to resist the plans of global oil companies. 22 JUNE | Copenhagen, Denmark: A coalition of rebels and Scientist Rebellion activists blockade the road into Kastrup airport for several hours. Protesters played music, danced, did yoga, and read books. The Kastrup blockades are monthly and part of the Stay Grounded campaign to end frequent flying and ban private jets. 23 JUNE | Connecticut, USA: Six rebels let off flares as they stormed the green of a PGA Tour golf tournament. Play was briefly delayed as police tackled the XR NYC activists, all of whom were wearing shirts that said “No Golf On a Dead Planet”. They were arrested and charged with first-degree criminal mischief. 25 JUNE - ??? | Newcastle, Australia: Blockade Australia returns to shut down the largest coal port in the world! At the time of writing, there have been 27 consecutive actions across 2 weeks causing over 95 hours of disruption, and the campaign looks unlikely to end any time soon. Activists have occupied trains or suspended themselves over the railway that links coal mine to coal port. They are all heroes. 26 JUNE | France, Uganda & Global: Rebels and other activists team up with StopEACOP to launch a global day of action calling on China to end its financial support of the ecocidal pipeline. Rallies were held outside Chinese embassies in 11 countries across 3 continents. In Paris, France (top) activists set up an impressive wooden pipeline in front of their embassy, while in Kololo, Uganda (bottom) police beat the peaceful protesters and arrested 30. Anti-extractivist campaign in December, 2023 Photo: @espejogalactico My name is Clarisa, and I’m a socio-environmental activist and environmental engineering student from Misiones, a province in the northeast of Argentina. The Misiones jungle is home to 52% of the country's biodiversity and is now threatened with extinction. I first became aware of the climate crisis at a very young age. By the time I was 10, I had seen extreme floods, forest fires and the sad reality of native fauna killed by these disasters and extractive corporations. These experiences deeply sensitised me and led me to dedicate myself to the protection of nature. My work in XR began in 2021 with XR Misiones, where we accompany the indigenous Mbya Guarani people in their struggle against forestry corporations. I have also been elected XR’s regional liaison for Latin America, responsible for making the voices of the Latin American people heard and expanding our claims, weaving a network of activists around the world. I am focused on publicising the true impact of the carbon market – a greenwashing strategy of oil companies to continue polluting at the expense of ecosystems in the Global South and the blood of indigenous communities. In Argentina, not only are we vulnerable to climate, ecological, economic and social crises, but we are also openly attacked from the highest echelons of power. Under President Milei and his ultra-right government, persecution, harassment and violence against activists has intensified, to the point where we are being labelled terrorists. Milei's government utilises highly violent fascist rhetoric that openly promotes hatred and polarisation against those of us who defend the rights of nature. We have living memory of the resistance to Argentina’s previous civil military dictatorship and recognize the importance of fighting for human rights. However, many human rights organisations still look the other way regarding the consequences of extractivism. We are working to spread the understanding that the struggle for human rights and for the rights of nature are inseparable. Being an activist, for me, means being a voice for nature that is crying out to be defended. It means protecting Mother Earth with all my being. I do it because the love I have for life is infinite. To all you brave rebels engaging in non-violent civil disobedience: let us continue to stand firm in our struggle, expand the love we feel for life, and weave greater bonds of community and resistance among the most vulnerable regions. Every peaceful action we take is an act of resistance against destructive models and an affirmation of our commitment to a liveable and just future for all. Together, we are an unstoppable force, capable of catalysing real, positive change in our communities and beyond. Every step we take is a legacy of hope for future generations.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/06/14/global-newsletter-89/,"Rebels and activists from 9 pan-African movements protest outside the African Energies Summit in London. This issue: Spanish Rebellion | Stop The Scramble For Africa | Growth Kills! | Dear rebel, Last month was the hottest May on record, marking an entire year of continuous record-breaking global temperatures, and offering yet more evidence that the planet’s weather system is unravelling. While 600,000 people were displaced by unprecedented floods in the south of Brazil, the north of the country was undergoing a record-breaking heatwave. As people died from heatstroke in the 52.3°C air of Delhi, people in the East of India were drowning in the rains of a cyclone. This is the world that fossil fuels have given us, with extreme weather reaping random destruction in nearly every region of the world simultaneously. It is no wonder that climate scientists are in despair. A week of Spanish rebellion finishes with a march through central Madrid. But last month also saw rebels rise up to take down the fossil fuel industry, and stop us slipping further into this new norm of killer weather and chaos. In Action Highlights, we report on a spectacular week of rebellion in Spain that targeted fossil fuel subsidies. We also cover how XR UK and an alliance of African groups disrupted oil executives as they planned yet another plunder of Africa during a secret summit in London. For Humans of XR we speak to an incredible young rebel resisting the oil industry in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, and in Solidarity Corner we profile Growth Kills, a new group exposing how our growth-dependent economic system is keeping us wedded to the fossil fuel era. Growth Kills blockade the European Commission in the run-up to EU elections. To end on a bright note, an IPCC climate scientist has been elected as president of Mexico, the first time a climate scientist has become a national leader. For a country suffering from a series of killer heatwaves, and a capital city that is close to running out of water, the end of business-as-usual can’t come soon enough. If she cuts ties with her pro-fossil fuel predecessor, and fulfils the green promises of her campaign, we could finally have a world leader to believe in.

Photo: Mar Sala Madrid became a festival of colour, music, dancing and disruption, as rebels from across Spain converged on the capital to demand an end to fossil fuel subsidies. More than 150 activists took over the Gran Vía, the most famous street in the city, and put on a show for surprised shoppers and police that involved an oil well, a fake oil spill, a die-in, and a giant tree representing a new path for humanity. The rebels then paraded their tree through central Madrid, stopping at one of the city’s busiest public squares to hear speeches and bring flowers to the paving stones. Despite unannounced protests being illegal in Spain, skilled rebel mediators approached police quickly, and there were no arrests or fines. XR Barcelona occupied the port while rebels sprayed the mega-yachts. The rally was XR Madrid’s biggest action since the pandemic and made for a spectacular end to a week of nationwide rebellion launched as part of the Stop EU Fossil Subsides campaign. Earlier in the week, rebels in Barcelona joined Scientist Rebellion to spray several mega-yachts with black biodegradable paint, condemning the pollution of luxury tourism in a region that’s suffered an unprecedented three years of drought. XR Pamplona covered their city in murals showing fictional villains like Freddy Krueger and Chucky asking for fossil subsidies to continue. In the north of the country, XR Asturies blockaded a major steel works in Gijón, highlighting how the steel industry makes intensive use of fossil fuels. And, on the day the Spanish government formally recognised the State of Palestine, XR Madrid and an alliance of other groups staged a sit-in at a major train station, condemning the hypocrisy of their government for still doing business with Israel. XR Asturies blockade the entrance to a steel works. Photo: David Aguilar Sánchez XR Madrid was hit badly by the pandemic, then rocked again when a dedicated rebel was revealed to be a police spy in 2023. In February this year, the group was fined more than €20,000 for trying to stop 600 trees from being felled in a public park. But the rebels have proved resilient and are amazed at how successfully they united XR Spain to finish up this rebellion. Their goal is to keep building connections with XR groups and other movements around the country, and to wake up the public and the Spanish media to the fact that the climate crisis is happening right now.

XR UK and allied groups confronted delegates and made a lot of noise outside the Africa Energies Summit, a three-day conference where Big Oil executives and their political fixers planned the plunder of the continent’s remaining oil and gas. The location of the summit was kept secret even from the delegates until 24hrs before the start, in the hope that protesters would be kept at bay. But rebels were waiting outside the venue as 500 delegates arrived for an opening VIP breakfast, and were shoved aside by security as they tried to block doorways. The next morning, rebels were joined by pan-African organisations to welcome the rattled delegates, and then make enough noise to disrupt the talks inside. After a chorus of vuvuzelas and a performance by Senegalese drummers, the summit organisers called in the police. Rebels negotiated with police to ensure time for speeches and a mock awards ceremony for the crooked oil companies nearby. As well as activists, arriving delegates had to get through the XR Oil Slickers. Speakers compared the summit’s last-ditch scramble for oil and gas reserves to the colonial plundering of Africa in the 1880s. While the fossil fuel companies claim they will bring “progress”, African countries have been exporting oil for decades, and the results have been devastating. Africa’s major oil producers, like Nigeria and South Sudan, are still plagued by extreme poverty, and 600 million Africans lack access to electricity. The continent has been poisoned by oil spills and toxic gas flaring, and communities have been broken to make way for pipelines. Africa is uniquely vulnerable to climate change, and with its abundant solar and wind potential, it could be the first zero-emissions continent. But the fossil fuel companies don’t want that to happen, and next year’s summit in London is already being planned. Wherever the delegates end up, rebels will be waiting for them.

They condemned airlines like KLM for running schemes that reward and encourage frequent flying, and demanded fines for the ecocidal behaviour instead. 9 MAY | Dublin, Ireland: XR Ireland disrupt the black tie dinner of the Irish Funds Industry Association, whose members include billion dollar fossil fuel investors like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Citibank. Rebels glued themselves to entrances and forced the attendees to pass through their rally to get inside. A full write-up is available on the XR Ireland website. 12 MAY | NYC, USA: In 2023, Americans spent $147 billion on their pets, but only $1.2 billion was spent on protecting endangered wildlife. XR NYC highlighted these warped priorities by peacefully disrupting a dog show, running onto a canine assault course and unfurling a banner that read ‘No Dogs on a Dead Planet’. 16 MAY | Adelaide, Australia: Hundreds of activists including rebels stage a sit-in on the 1st anniversary of the introduction of repressive anti-protest laws. Police fined 8 protesters when they refused to move from the road. The new laws mean the maximum penalty for obstructing a public place has jumped from $750 to $50,000 or 3 months in prison. Photo: Peter Barnes 17 MAY | Berlin, Germany & Butembo, DRC: Rebels rally in Germany and DRC simultaneously to highlight how the Congolese people are being exploited by tech companies for their natural resources. An Apple shop in Berlin was spray-painted, while more than 200 activists rallied outside. At the same time, rebels marched through Butembo in the DRC, calling for Virunga National Park to be protected from oil and gas extraction, and for the world to recognise that an ecological transition cannot be smeared with the blood of the Congolese people. 20 MAY | La Paz, Bolivia: Horror at the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by Israel powers a major march through the Bolivian capital. Rebels joined an alliance of protesters to rally outside the embassies of the U.S., the U.K., and Germany for their support of genocidal Zionist imperialism. 22 & 24 MAY | Cape Town & Vanderbijlpark, South Africa: To mark World Biodiversity Day, XR Cape Town protest their city’s use of cancer-linked pesticides on roads, parks and other spaces. Days earlier, XR Vaal and allies rallied outside the AGM of local steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal to demand a decarbonised future. 24 MAY | Paris, France: As part of the LiquidationTotal campaign, 600 activists from across France rally outside Amundi, the biggest asset manager in Europe and the main shareholder of TotalEnergies. Protesters poured into Amundi’s foyer as the company held its AGM, and riot police reacted violently, beating and dragging people, arresting 200 at random on exaggerated charges, keeping 50 of those stuffed in a bus for 6 hours, and kettling many more on the roadside. XR France are preparing a legal case against the French police for their violence. 25 MAY | Global: Mothers* Rebellion hold their 5th global rebellion, with mothers and allies forming circles in 75 cities across 26 countries. Pictured: Delhi, India. 26 MAY–2 JUNE | UK and Global: XR UK totally blockade the country’s largest private jet airport, using tripods, locks, and a pink boat to sustain the disruption. It was part of a global wave of actions against private jets that saw airports targeted in 8 countries. The actions came weeks after a new study concluded that climate emissions from aviation are 50% higher than previously reported. 27 MAY | Kampala, Uganda: Stop EACOP activists and allies are arrested for peacefully protesting outside the Chinese Embassy. The rally was organised after reports that the Chinese state is considering investing in the EACOP pipeline. Protesters stood outside the embassy waiting to hand over a petition to officials, but police instead rounded them up and jailed seven overnight. Growth Kills, Scientist Rebellion, and XR Belgium launch their 3-days of actions ahead of the EU elections. Home to the world's second-largest population of lobbyists, Brussels has become a nexus for business-as-usual. That’s why for the last 18 months Growth Kills, a group dedicated to dismantling the assumption that economic growth must continue, have been disrupting conferences and blockading buildings in the city “Our strategy is to disrupt meetings where power is concentrated and to force the speakers to defend themselves in front of their audiences” says an organiser. “Amazingly, we’ve even gotten applause from some of the audiences. That shows just how ridiculous the growth-at-all-costs narrative has become.” Growth Kills has 5 demands for EU institutions: the abandonment of GDP as an index of prosperity, the creation of a sovereign citizens' assembly to decide our common future, laws to make corporations pay the true social and environmental costs of their activities, the end of overconsumption and the advertising that drives it, and the return of essential resources to the commons so they are free for all. A Growth Kills activist blockades the European Commission. Leading up to the EU elections, Growth Kills teamed up with XR Belgium and Scientist Rebellion for three days of actions to demand an economy where planetary boundaries and the well-being of all take priority over profits for the few. The highlight was a blockade of the European Commision, with activists sticking their hands to the entrance, stopping workers from entering, and wielding banners that derided green growth and GDP. A giant poster was attached to the building saying ‘The Future is Degrowth’. Growth Kills also prioritised public engagement. The group made time to dialogue with shoppers on the high street, and hold a public workshop to demystify degrowth and present a positive, practical vision for the future. The result has been dozens of new members, and even the support of a leading IPCC scientist. Growth Kills talk to the public at a busy shopping centre in Brussels. “Previously, we didn’t get a lot of engagement during public events like this, but with the Growth Kills campaign that has been changing. People are really connecting with us and expressing their fear and suffering. They are looking for a change, a vision for something better. It feels like we’re approaching a paradigm shift”, said the organiser. Growth Kills believes that activism must help people to challenge the planetocidal ideology of capitalism, and use our collective imagination to build a happy world. Wherever you are on the planet, they have an action toolkit to help you set up a Growth Kills chapter there. Join Growth Kills and follow their campaign on X. In this novel, the first of a series, a small community in the northeast of the former United States starts getting its act together again after the collapse of civilization. The collapse appears to have been an economic and political crisis that passed some tipping point—but however it happened, fossil fuel use appears to be over or nearly over. The resulting world is ugly, but only because the backstory is full of upheaval and tragedy, and also the people are mostly jerks. The lack of fossil fuel itself doesn't look bad. The plot is slow but not in a bad way, the characters are engaging, and the world-building is richly detailed and largely believable. Unfortunately, this is a book about only white men. Whether the exclusion of non-white characters and the marginalisation of female characters is deliberate on Kunstler's part or just plain sloppy could be interesting food for discussion, but either way, bias is on display. World Made by Hand is worth reading anyway for its immersive exploration of a possible post-fossil future, its honest acknowledgment of climate change as a constant background element (a weirdly rare thing in fiction), and for the important conversations it could foster.

Currently, I'm not studying due to the recurrence of armed conflict in my province of North Kivu since the end of 2022. In this context of violence, I initiated XR Rutshuru to organise and mobilise young volunteers through non-violent actions to demand participatory and responsible governance of protected areas in the DRC. Through other associated movements, such as Amani Institute ASBL where I am a co-founding member, I try to help community members rebuild themselves psychologically despite the traumatic ordeals they undergo on a daily basis. My motivation for initiating a local XR group stemmed from these events – in particular, the unprecedented humanitarian tragedy coupled with the effects of global warming that are already being acutely felt. I challenged myself to dissuade young people from joining armed groups, and to work together to create positive change in the community. I've participated in campaigns like Fossil Free Virunga, Decolonize Virunga, Fossil Free DRC, and am currently involved in the #SaveVirunga campaign. We are pressuring the Congolese authorities to cancel tenders for the illegal sale of 27 oil blocks and 3 gas blocks located in vulnerable protected areas, including Virunga National Park, one of the oldest national parks in Africa whose conservation provides livelihoods for over 5 million people. To be an activist for me means to enable others to achieve common goals. I'm proud to be an activist because I'm convinced that the fight we’re waging is going to change history. What motivates me is indignation at everything we're going through. I tell myself that I have to work to make communities aware of the problems we face, so that together we can hold our leaders to account. This work is ever more challenging as it is ever more urgent. The security situation in our regional capital Goma has now gotten so bad that we are no longer able to organise activities there. Repeated attacks by Rwanda-backed militias in the region have caused widespread displacement. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in tent encampments with no food, drinking water, sanitation, or roofs – abandoned by international humanitarian organisations. Goma itself is suffocating as the villages that supply it with food are occupied by militias. My message to fellow XR rebels is to ask for their solidarity in relation to this crisis we are enduring as a result of the unjust aggression by Rwanda and its extractivist partners. We call for an end to this hypocrisy on the part of the international community. The blood of the Congolese people has long been shed freely, and this must stop.

Photo: Mar Sala Video: Oil CEO Slammed Over “Inconceivable Greed” (4 mins) A young Scottish climate activist was invited to speak at the AGM of Equinor, the Norwegian oil company that is responsible for the UK’s largest undeveloped oil field Rosebank. Looking directly at Equinor’s CEO, and representatives of its majority shareholder, the Norwegian government, she gave them 4 minutes of blistering truth. Article: Hopeless and Broken: Why Top Climate Scientists are in Despair The Guardian asked 380 climate scientists what they felt about the future. 77% thought global temperatures will rise by at least 2.5°C, while 42% thought they will rise by more than 3°C. Just 6% thought the 1.5°C limit will be met. Collectively, they are terrified. Mentioning climate activists, one scientist said, “All these young people were so charged up, so impassioned. So I said I’ll keep doing this, not for the politicians, but for you.” Article: Crossing The Rubicon A rebel writer reflects personally on the future of the world and our movement now that average global temperatures have exceeded 1.5°C for over twelve months. Article: The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change The economic damage caused by climate change will be six times larger than previously thought, making unilateral decarbonisation cost-effective even for large countries like the US. That’s the conclusion of this paper, written by economists after analysing global temperature changes. They also conclude that global GDP would be 37% higher today had no warming occurred between 1960 and 2019. Eat that, neoliberals.

Photo: Pieter Geens This issue: April Victories! | Brussels Blockade | Let Lake Victoria Breathe! Dear rebel, When a small group of students pitched tents at Columbia University in New York to peacefully protest Israel’s genocide in Gaza, no one could have predicted it would spark a worldwide movement. But then the university president decided to call in the riot police, 100 students were brutally arrested, and the outrage led to solidarity camps appearing on campuses right across America, and then the world. For weeks, American students have braved police violence, a hostile media, fascist mobs, and political condemnation. More than 2000 have been arrested. But they remain defiant, and in their defiance they’ve made world leaders look weak, the Western media look deranged, and galvanised the Palestinian cause everywhere. They have emphatically proven that peaceful protest can change the world. A non-violent student protester is arrested by LA riot police. Photo: Eric Kelly In this issue, we underline the power of peaceful protest by spotlighting some amazing victories by ecoactivists over the last month. From corporate divestment to landmark court rulings to political concessions, April has been full of climate action wins, and you can find out about six of the best in our Special Report. In Action Highlights, we cover a joint-blockade by Dutch and Belgian rebels in Brussels, the first fruit of a new European-wide alliance against fossil fuel subsidies. We also investigate another activist alliance in the Kenyan city of Kisumu, where protesters are struggling to preserve life in their local water source, Lake Victoria. An alliance of young activists are making waves beside Lake Victoria, Kenya. At the time of writing, there are 151 pro-Palestine camps in campuses across America, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Ireland, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Turkey, Tunisia, Australia, and Japan. Student rallies have also been held in Italy, India and Lebanon. In Israel, two students refusing to serve in the military had their prison terms extended by an IDF court. There are young heroes everywhere you look. A new generation is rejecting the horror and hypocrisy of the old world, and uniting to birth a new one. If students are our future, then for once, the future is looking bright. This newsletter is available in multiple languages. Use the globe icon (top right) to change language.

Donate What You Can 4 MAY | Brussels, Belgium Red Rebels celebrate the arrival of the blockaders. Photo: Wouter van Leeuwen Hundreds of rebels from across Europe, including bus-loads of activists from the Netherlands, have been subjected to police violence during a peaceful blockade in Brussels a month before EU elections. 270 rebels marched down a street beside the European Parliament, chanting and holding banners against fossil fuel subsidies, before sitting down to blockade the entrance to a tunnel. Water cannons were deployed but not used, with riot police instead encircling those protesters who refused to leave, handcuffing them with plastic zip ties, loading them onto buses, and holding some in cells overnight. Worse, a group of 50 activists that included families, children and the elderly had gathered at a nearby public square to listen to talks by a European minister and former UN Special Rapporteur. Riot police also closed down this registered gathering, shoving some people to the ground and beating them with batons. Rebels were soaked by heavy rain rather than the police water cannons, and used armlocks and glue to prolong the blockade. Photo: Pieter Geens In total, 132 rebels were arrested during the protests, which was a collaboration between XR Belgium and XR Netherlands, and the first action organised by United for Climate Justice (UCJ), a new European coalition involving eco-groups from 15 different countries, and inspired by the A12 motorway blockades in the Netherlands. The A12 campaign galvanised XR Netherlands, swelling it with new volunteers and eventually pushing the Dutch parliament to propose an end to fossil fuel subsidies, the campaign’s key demand. But since that high last year, the political process has stalled, with the “complexity of European agreements” being deployed as an excuse. This is why UCJ is now expanding the campaign to stop subsidies across the EU. The EU spends more than €405,000,000,000 per year subsidising fossil fuels, ten times more than it spends on green policies. It means the average EU taxpayer is forced to pay around €2000 per year destroying the planet. The UCJ campaign has already won fans within the European Greens political party, and rebels in the Netherlands have been invited to contribute to a national parliamentary debate on ending fossil fuel subsidies in June. Hopes remain high that all of Europe’s politicians can be convinced to stop funding planetary destruction. Follow the Stop EU Fossil Subsidies campaign. 19 APR | Kisumu, Kenya An alliance of ecoactivists take to the streets of Kisumu city in Kenya. Dozens of young activists have marched through the Kenyan city of Kisumu, on the north-eastern shore of Lake Victoria, and demanded that their government protect the key water source from toxic pollution and suffocating weeds. Coordinated by Kisumu Environmental Champions, a community-based organisation founded by an 18-year-old student, and uniting young activists from multiple groups including XR, Mothers’ Rebellion, and Friday’s For Future, the day of action began with a 10km march along the lake. Marchers called on the Kenyan government to take immediate action to ‘Let Lake Victoria Breathe Again’ and stop the fossil-fuel-produced pollution, plastic waste, and invasive water hyacinths that are choking the life within it. Fish stocks in the lake are drastically depleting due to pollution, warming, and acidification, while vast amounts of plastic waste are managing to clog the biggest tropical lake in the world. The Champions have led several plastic clean-ups of the lake in recent months. Plastic clean-ups and school eco-events has become regular sights in Kisumu. Another core aspect of the day of action was education. Champions have been giving talks in local schools and community centres about how fossil fuels and the oil industry bring climate change, plastic waste, and pollution to their doorstep. More and more local people are now joining the environmental movement. Despite contributing far less than 0.1% of planetary emissions, Kenya is suffering more acutely from the effects of global heating than the rich countries who are overwhelmingly responsible. Recent flooding in Kisumu and the surrounding region has killed hundreds of people and displaced thousands more. The force and severity of the floods are unprecedented, and locals expect more in the coming weeks. As well as calling for the restoration of Lake Victoria, Kisumu Environmental Champions want their government to sign the international Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty and endorse a legally binding treaty on plastic pollution. The group’s activist alliance are planning many more actions, including a climate camp, a sustainable transport campaign, and a screening of the film Shifting Power by Don’t Gas Africa. These young activists know that their future is in the balance right now, and they’re doing everything they can to promote care and respect for the living world on which we all depend. Follow Kisumu Environmental Champions on Facebook 8–24 APRIL | Global Victories in Switzerland, France, India, Ecuador, UK and Sweden. There’s something about April. Five years ago, the April Rebellion in London saw XR go from fringe group to global protest phenomenon. And this year, April has seen rebels and their allies win a series of powerful victories right across the world. Here are six of the best to remind you that peaceful activism really is the answer... APRIL 8 | Switzerland: Insurer Zurich Dumps Oil & Gas In Issue 86 we covered the Insure Our Future campaign, which saw actions in 31 countries against major insurance firms that back fossil fuel projects. XR UK held a meeting with the CEO of Zurich, the world’s 6th biggest fossil fuel insurer, and weeks later, the firm announced it would no longer underwrite new fossil fuel projects. At the company's AGM, protestors musically reminded Zurich that ""we will watch you."" APRIL 9 | France: European Court Rules Climate Inaction Illegal Activists with KlimaSeniorinnen (Senior Women for Climate Protection) have won a landmark case in the European Court of Human Rights. The Swiss women argued that heat waves were ruining their health and restricting their lives, and the Court agreed, ruling that their government’s inaction on global warming was violating their human rights. The ruling means 46 countries in Europe could now see similar legal challenges for their own negligence around the climate crisis. Find out more by checking out the podcast in Must Reads. APRIL 10 | India: Villagers Block Huge Adani Coal Mine A huge proposed coal mine has been sent back to the drawing board after Indian villagers won their case against coal giant Adani Group in the High Court of Odisha. The court found that Adani and the Indian Government failed to properly consult local people about the impacts of the Bijahan mega-mine. Meetings with the villagers lasted only a single day, despite the mine threatening their homes, land and livelihoods. Days later, scientists and youth activists in the UK occupied a science museum to protest its sponsorship by Adani. APRIL 21 | Ecuador: The People Say No (Again) To Corporate Courts Ecuador’s people emphatically voted to keep an article of their constitution which stops global corporations from suing their government when laws challenge their interests. Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) is a convoluted legal mechanism used by Big Oil to penalise countries passing progressive climate policies. In 2012, an ISDS tribunal ordered Ecuador to pay a US oil company $1.5 billion in compensation, 135% of its annual healthcare budget. Despite the best efforts of the current oligarch-friendly administration, Ecuador remains a shining example of how countries can extract themselves from this farcical arbitration designed to bankrupt them for standing up to ecocidal corporations. APRIL 22 | UK: Sign-Holding Rebel Defies Judge Last year, a rebel held up a placard in silence outside a court. It reminded jurors that they had the legal right to find people not guilty. She did this after watching a trial where the ecoactivist defendants were banned by the judge from mentioning climate change, and subject to other repressive measures designed to stop juries sympathising with them. The following day, the judge had her handcuffed, locked up, and investigated by a team of government lawyers for contempt of court. After nearly a year, and hundreds of activists holding similar signs in solidarity, the case was thrown out of court, and the rebel, a retired social worker, is free. APRIL 24 | Sweden: Restore Wetlands Declares Job Done! In a press conference outside the Swedish parliament, the activists of Restore Wetlands announced they were getting off the motorway and putting away the glue. Why? Because after two years of blockading roads, drawing media attention, and triggering debates, 75% of the Swedish population think it’s important to restore the nation’s wetlands, and every political party has committed to doing so, with the government even making it a priority issue. Victories are rarely as sweet or total as this, and the activists are now turning their attention to the ecocidal peat industry. 4 APRIL | Belgrade, Serbia: Healthy natural food, or toxic lithium-laced water? That was the choice rebels were offering outside the Ministry of Mining and Energy during Rio Tinto’s AGM in London. The mining corporation is planning to open a lithium mega-mine in Serbia, and the nation’s groundwater is at risk. 9 APR | Budapest, Hungary: Rebels rally outside the Marriott Hotel where the Budapest Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) Summit conference is taking place. Rebels called on their government to ban new fossil fuel projects. Photo: Boglárka Nagy 9 APR | Toronto, Canada: Nine climate activists with Faith and Climate Action are arrested and fined for trespassing after forming a prayer circle inside a branch of Royal Bank of Canada. RBC is funding the Coastal GasLink Pipeline that is trespassing on unceded Wet'suwet'en lands, and is the 5th biggest funder of fossil fuels projects in the world. 13 APR | Jinja, Uganda: XR Uganda Great Lakes collaborate with village schools in the south to restore the local environment and plant trees. Days later, protests by families in the Western district of Buliisa were broken up by police. The families face eviction to make way for TotalEnergies’ Tilenga oil project, and have been offered inadequate compensation by the $170bn corporation. 20 APRIL | Bath & Adelaide, UK & Australia: Funerals for nature are held on opposite ends of the planet. Hundreds of Red Rebels draw vast crowds as they lead solemn marches through city centres to mourn the immense and continuing loss of biodiversity across the world. 20 APRIL | Boston, USA: XR Boston resist the planned expansion of Hanscom Airfield, which would increase private jet flights by 300% and wipe out the climate benefits of all solar panels ever installed in the state of Massachusetts. Two days later, 300 rebels occupied Seaport Bridge and demanded their Governor ban all new fossil fuel infrastructure. 20 APRIL | Barcelona, Spain: Blue Rebels lead a spiritual procession through an ancient part of the city to denounce the mismanagement of the historic drought that is devastating Catalonia. Emergency water restrictions have been in place in the region since February. 22 APRIL | Global: Earth Day actions are held around the world. In Sweden, 1500 Mothers Rebellion activists combine knitted scarves and wrap the 4.3km mega-scarf right around the parliament building. In Rwanda, activists plant bamboo along the Miguramo river to stop local farmland from flooding. In DRC, rebels visit a refugee camp in the east of the country and plant trees. In America, rebels hold a climate gala in the capital and make the mayor guest of honour (he didn’t show up). 26–30 APRIL | Stockholm, Sweden: Rebels take part in five days of ‘House on Fire’ rebellion in the Swedish capital. They blockaded the city’s financial sector, occupied the offices of Stora Enso for its forest-razing ecocide in Uruguay and Brazil, stripped naked outside H&M, and disrupted an airport. 27 APR | Turin, Italy: 150 rebels occupy the skyscraper HQ of Italy’s largest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, for its vast funding of fossil fuel projects. Rebels scaled the outside of the building, occupied its lobby, and chained themselves to its entrance. 60 were arrested. The rebel action was just one of many in the city as it hosted a G7 meeting about climate, energy, and environment. 27 APR | Goma, DRC: XR Rutshuru collect plastic waste along the shores of Lake Kivu. A recent study showed the plastics industry releases four times as much greenhouse gas as the airline industry. Earlier in the month, rebels marched through the city and called on the Congolese government to immediately suspend all new oil and gas extraction in the country. Swiss ecoactivists after winning a landmark EU legal case against their government. Article: If We Burn - Learning From The Mass Protest Decade American journalist and writer Vincent Bevins discusses his celebrated book ‘If We Burn’, which investigates why so many recent mass protest movements have promised so much but resulted in failure. The author explains why XR didn’t feature in the book, the lessons our movement might learn from his case studies, and how the Gaza student camps in America show that protest movements are learning from the failures of the past. The interview is also available as a podcast. Podcast: How Swiss Women Won a Landmark Climate Case (26 mins) A KlimaSeniorinnen activist explains how her group of elderly climate activists won their case against the Swiss government at the European court of human rights, while a climate journalist explains what the win means for future cases. Video: The Fight Against Mining Extractivism in Panama (78 mins) We covered last year’s incredible mass rebellion by the people of Panama against the mining industry in Issue 83. Now, Scientist Rebellion discusses the movement with two of its leaders, and explores the lessons that have been learned. The interview is in Spanish - use YouTube subtitles to translate into other languages. Article: Ocean Spray Emits More PFAS Than Industry XR France’s campaign against PFAS producer Arkema means the dangers of these ‘forever chemicals’ have featured in this newsletter.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/05/07/if-we-burn/,"In the decades since scientists sounded the alarm on climate change, it’s become clear that fossil elites will not stop causing planet-scale destruction until they’re overpowered by mass movements. This is easier said than done. In If We Burn: the Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution, Vincent Bevins considers the wave of huge popular mobilisations which swept the world during the 2010s. By interviewing activists and organisers from Brazil to Egypt to Ukraine, he offers some invaluable insights into the ways that people fight for better worlds – and sometimes, tragically, end up with worse ones. The combination of well-executed interviews and deft narrative history makes this book enormously engaging on its own merits: the twists and turns of quasi-revolutionary moments in Tahrir Square, Gezi Park and Hong Kong could rival any thriller. At the same time, Bevins’s thoughtful portrayal of activists’ voices and struggles offers a profound sense of shared human struggle. As a flightless Scot, I’ve rarely felt such a sense of connection, bordering on kinship, to global allies as when reading this. It's testament to Bevins’s craft that his analysis is scarcely less engaging than his narrative. Synthesising interviews with 250 activists and organisers, and also drawing on a range of movement theorists, his primary thesis is that a global tendency towards ‘horizontalism’ (a mistrust of representation, leaders, hierarchies, maybe even structures) has allowed social movements to grow rapidly, but at the fatal price of being easily co opted. One of the many things I found interesting about Bevins’s account was that it made virtually no mention of the mainly European and American climate mobilisations in 2018-19. He gives good reasons for this (the most humbling is simply that his interest is in movements which gain so much momentum as to threaten and/or unseat governments). On the other hand, it seems important to consider how the lessons of If We Burn map onto climate movements in general and Extinction Rebellion in particular – not least in a context of surging mobilisation around Palestine. I spoke to Vincent to see what Extinction Rebellion and other climate activists could learn from his findings. You can listen to our conversation as a podcast here. This interview has been edited for length and clarity Douglas Rogers (D) So your book is called If We Burn: the Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution. Could you tell me what it's about? Vincent Bevins (V) Yes, the book attempts to be a history of the world from 2010 to 2020. Of course it is not possible to actually tell the history of the world over the course of ten years. So like any work of history, it chooses what to include and exclude, and it's focused based on a set of concerns. So this work of history is one that is told, and put together through interviews, as if the most important thing to happen in that decade were the protests that get so large that it either fundamentally destabilises, or indeed overthrows, an existing government. And that story, that history is built around one troubling question, which is: how is it that so many of these mass protest movements, these mass protests in the 2010s, apparently led to the opposite of what they were asking for? D You had about a dozen case studies where you're looking at specific moments where protests became so large that they reached this kind of regime threatening size. Could you describe one of them to give a flavour? V The case that takes up the most space in the book, partially because I lived through it and partially because I think it takes longer to unravel and longer for the consequences to become clear, is the Brazilian case. So very briefly: In June 2013, a group called the Movimento Passe Livre (MPL) began organising a set of demonstrations against a fare hike in Sao Paulo, largest city in South America – and this is something that they've been doing for eight years. But what happened on June 13th, 2013 is that the media and the ruling class of Brazil had gotten tired of these raucous, prefigurative and very disruptive protests. The media called for a police crackdown. That crackdown came. And that crackdown hit not only the original leftists and anarchists and punks that were really so central to putting the movement together, it also hit people like me. It hit journalists in the mainstream media. It hit quote unquote ‘innocent civilians’, it hit the kind of person violence against which shocks mainstream media and political sentiment in Brazil. So very quickly the mainstream media that had called for a crackdown on the protests of June 2013 flipped their position and began to praise the protest. But of course they could not praise them for the same reason, you know, their justifications or their praise could not reproduce the discourse of the actual MPL itself, because MPL believed in energetic direct action with the goal of decommodifying all public transportation in Brazil. This was not a project or a tactical approach that Brazil's mainstream media shared, so as they flipped from saying ‘we need to crack down on these punks and anarchists and get them off the streets’ to: ‘this is a great patriotic uprising and defence of the right to rise up in defence of something’ - they supply their own reasons as to why it was possible to praise this uprising. And so what you saw was over the next few days, tens and then hundreds of thousands of Brazilians rush into the streets – apparently behind this original set of protests organised by the MPL. And this is experienced by many of the people, many of the original organisers, many of these sympathisers of the MPL, and even, I think by me, as a moment of euphoric victory. Like, Oh my God, it's happened. The people are finally rising up in defence of better public services, and in opposition to police brutality. But it becomes quite clear that the people rushing into the streets were not necessarily rushing into the streets behind the MPL, so much as chronologically after, and this distinction becomes very important throughout the mass protest decade. And so they come into the streets with a new set of ideas as to what the whole thing is about. They have different political orientations than the original organisers, and the MPL does not only not believe in leading the popular revolt (they believe that their job was to spark one and then sort of step off the stage): even their attempts to maintain the focus on the original goal, which was to overthrow the bus fare rise and to keep their focus on public transportation. These concerns are swept aside by the wave of humanity that comes to the streets. After the crackdown… I mean a lot more happens. But to summarise: in the weeks following the crackdown, new arrivals – some of whom we could now recognise as the beginnings of a far right in Brazil - sometimes I call them proto-Bolsonaristas because these are the people that later end up becoming the foot soldiers for the extreme right movement that puts support in Jair Bolsonaro – so these new arrivals enter into initially verbal but ultimately violent conflict with the original organisers and end up actually expelling many of the original leftists from the streets. And in this strange ball of energy and strange sort of pressure cooker of an unplanned super mass revolt, other movements are born, one of which is a group of young libertarians and free market activists, funded by think tanks in the United States or trained by the Koch brothers. And this group, I think correctly recognises that the meaning of the streets is up for contestation and they step onto the scene pretending to be the thing that the MPL actually is. They pretend to be an autonomous grassroots leaderless, digitally coordinated idealistic youth movement, and they even create a name which is an intentional copy of MPL, they create the MBL which is the Movimento Brazil Livre rather than MPL. And this group over the years that follows plays a much larger role in shaping the political outcomes in Brazil than the MPL does. They lead a new protest movement to remove democratically elected left of centre President Dilma Rousseff and then they campaigned for Jair Bolsonaro in 2018 and then entered government with him in 2019. So that was at least my personal experience in which over the years that I lived in this strange process by which things get worse and then even worse than and even worse than that, from 2013 to 2019 in Brazil. It seemed that at one point, after the crackdown of June 13th that I experienced personally, the Brazilian people were asking for one thing – and then 5-6 years later they got the exact opposite. Now I don't think that the protest directly caused that reversal. But they certainly unleash some forces which became important parts of the reversal. So the Brazilian case is, as I say, the longest because I lived through it and I believed, I hoped that I was best placed to provide the kind of close, intimate recounting of a phenomenon where the devil really is in the details and how as with a lot of the mass protest movements that I described in this book, things really change from one morning to one evening and then they really change from one week to another. And a lot of that is erased or flattened by retrospective analysis just sort of trying to say, ‘oh, this is all about this event, this social condition and this is all about this demand’. So in the Brazilian case, I sort of spread it out over the entire book so that we could really trace how things change from day-to-day and from year to year. D So speaking of that tracing, you've already touched on this a little bit… to give an idea of the arc of the book: you extrapolate out from the Brazilian example and the dozen-ish other examples to trace a sort of general pattern which you're identifying as being remarkably global and having certain features in common and leading to certain outcomes in common. Could you outline what that pattern is? V Yes. So all of the cases that I choose to analyse, as I said, comprise a protest movement that gets so large that it either overthrows or fundamentally destabilises an existing government. So these 10 to 13 cases that I look at share many characteristics for two reasons (maybe three, let’s see how it goes). One is that there is intentional reproduction of tactics, so a lot of what happens in the 2010s can be seen as a response to the apparent success of the Tahrir Square occupation in early 2011. So after Tahrir Square, you see many, many other movements around the world sort of not only being inspired by what happened in Egypt, but sort of copying and pasting a tactical approach. But also I think there were global ideological and material conditions that made a certain type of action easiest compared to the historical alternatives, that made a certain type of response to injustice both ready to hand and tactically and morally privileged. So one way I summarised the phenomenon we are analysing here is to say that in the 2010s, one particular response to injustice or perceived injustice becomes hegemonic, often even appearing as the only or the ‘natural’ way to respond to government abuse, to respond to elites when they are abusing their power, abusing citizens. And that is the apparently spontaneous, leaderless, digitally coordinated, horizontally organised mass protest in public squares or public spaces. Now one thing that I want to do in the book is to show that each one of those ingredients in that recipe comes from somewhere. They all have sort of historical and ideological and material histories that we can trace and I try to do that very quickly; but more important than where I locate these, the genesis of each particular one is to make the point that they all came from somewhere: this was not indeed the only way, historically has not been the only way, to respond to injustice. And it has its particular strengths and its particular weaknesses. All of these elements may have been more or less present in some cases than others. In some cases, for example in the Brazilian case, the Movimento Passe Livre was explicitly – and now many of the members would say dogmatically – horizontalist. They put into their founding charter that they were a horizontal and autonomous group. In other cases, this is something that either existed concretely that came about in reality instead of being an intentional and ideological component of the organisers. But this is the package that I think becomes incredibly successful in the 2010s at putting people onto the streets, at destabilising or overthrowing existing governments and creating opportunities. But in many, many cases, at least historically, in this decade, it turns out to be poorly suited to taking advantage of the opportunities that are generated. D So yeah, I loved your book, loved what was beneath that outline. And I found it kind of both refreshing and humbling that in a book where the title describes mass protest in the 2010s, Extinction Rebellion (XR) doesn't come up at all. So how do you relate to XR? Needless to say we're not quite revolutionaries like those in Brazil - we, I and I think even within the kind of global north left we occupy a sometimes quite equivocal position – so I’m interested as to what are your conceptions of XR. V My understanding of it in 2019 was that it was a radical ecological movement aimed at using disruption to push for a greener future. That was my understanding at the time, and there hasn’t been much that’s changed. If I've learned a little bit more about this, it's you know because people have told me about particular ideological and tactical approaches, but the broad picture that I had then is, is that ‘oh yeah, this is a radical group pushing for a less destructive set of practices in the global economy’. So I didn't engage deeply with it, but my initial reaction was of default sympathy. D OK, so, since then it hasn't loomed too large for you, strategically or conceptually. V Well, when I write a book like this I spend so much time trying to really understand, read everything good that's been written about the movements that I analyse closely, and really reconstruct the story that I want to tell about the 10 to 13 cases that I'm going to include and so I spend so much time doing that that I end up trying not to speak off the cuff about the about movements that I know nothing about, nothing comparatively. I haven't done anything like the deep dive into XR that I did elsewhere. D OK, interesting, a relatively fresh audience: in that case I can run some precepts by you and see how they land! Because since conception I think one of the things I’ve found interesting about XR is that I think it's quite self-consciously a sort of ‘designed’ movement maybe unlike some of your more spontaneous examples… it was more of a project by nerds who had identified previous problems, and who at least hopefully have solutions. So as a first example and probably as one of more important ones: XR was very informed by Occupy that had gone before in London, and there were explicit efforts to integrate some of the lessons and shortcomings and strengths that had been encountered there. One of the main ones is this question of organising models and horizontalism/horizontality versus whatever else. And I think there was still a lot ambient – I think there is still a lot ambient – scepticism of verticality, so the attempt was to integrate both into a sort of hybrid – which was not innovated by XR, but was an existing framework called either Holacracy or Sociocracy. Have you come across either concept or generally this sort of effort to hybridise the vertical into the horizontal? V Yeah. I've heard the words sociocracy and of course I'm familiar with many, many attempts to sort of synthesise or sublate the contradiction between verticality and horizontality. But yeah, why don't you explain what it has meant for XR. D Well, it depends who you ask… as in, [in the UK] it was quite contested, it was messy the way it was implemented. Maybe unsurprisingly, you know, I’m sure we can all sympathise that these movements are innately messy. So we scaled very quickly in the style of a spontaneous horizontalist movement: we were able to scale and be agile and stuff, but we were able to retain – for a time – the benefits also of being able to coordinate and be cohesive. And basically we ran into limits around mid-2019: the tensions between those organising models and also the problem you identified several times in your book, of a lot of people joining our movement because of what they thought they were joining… V Right. D And so yeah. I think, we encountered some sort of decisive difficulties in running that model which have subsequently in the past like three years, maybe been folded back in and it’s possible that sociocracy is still running well now, although then there's problems with… Yeah, it's a long story. But so: do you have much faith in those models working? Insofar as it's a running theme throughout your book, I think one way of reading your book’s thesis is basically just we need to ‘do Leninism’. Like, to really boil it down: you're making this kind of riposte to the horizontalist consensus. V So the method of the book is interpretative: I speak to 250 people in 12 countries. And it would be profoundly unfair to them, and dishonest to the reader, if I were to say: ‘Here's the responses that I think are right. Here's the type of thing that I want from you’. It is ortho journalism, so what I try to do to the best of my ability is summarise the most common answers. Now: ‘we were too decentralised’, is probably the most common answer. This happens on the left and the right. This happens also among many, many people that would reject the vast majority of what quote unquote Leninism is. This includes people that are to the right of centre: in the book I choose all types of movements, ideologically they're all over the spectrum. But again, I don't think my interviewees come around to the conclusion that there is a perfect amount of centralisation or decentralisation. I think what emerges is that there are various organisational forms available to different movements and to different historical moments into different geographic geographical locations around the world and to fetishize either maximal centralisation or maximal decentralisation, or any particular shape of movement can be a distraction from choosing, what happens to be most suited to the challenge. And because the readers of the book hopefully are coming from very, very different geographical locations and the challenges at hand for them are very different, I think that that hopefully is left up to the reader to decide what they take away from it. So I have been gratified to see the people in different countries say ‘Oh that reminds me of what I went through in my movement’. I've also been gratified to see that people do come to different questions, different conclusions about my conclusion. So there's one paragraph in the book that got attention and was reproduced in that Guardian extract and in Press Review: Not everyone changed their opinions. But everybody that did move, that did change their opinions moved in the same direction. Everyone moved back closer to the quote unquote Leninist organisational approach. But then, immediately after what I say is that the fact that this particular set of practises came together in the first place, and the fact that they were counterposed to Leninism, that they emerged as a response to Leninism, a rejection of Lenin. And all of that is historically contingent. So that itself is historically contingent: the idea that these things all go together on this side of the spectrum and on the opposite end of the spectrum is something like quote unquote, Leninism. All of that is historically contingent and there's no reason for it to be, for that spectrum to exist in that form. D One thing you mentioned that I find particularly striking is, yeah, the reaction to your book as almost its own sort of subject of interest. I’ve discussed it with a lot of friends and I find it intriguing how often I run into this kind of emotional attachment to the form you described. You mostly attribute the ascendance of horizontality to the failure of the Soviet Union and related 20th century ideas in the West. I'm curious if you have ideas beyond this as to why? Because it's not just a question of old people who were disillusioned when the Berlin Wall fell or whatever. The younger someone is, I think, the more likely they are to still, even after both the actual history of the 2010s and interpretations like yours, lean horizontalist. Do you have any further inklings as to why this kind of mindset is still so alluring? V So, you say there is an emotional feeling or an emotional attachment to the form that I described, right? D It seems to go deeper than just the history of a failed project to me. V So I will say that if I had not lived through Brazil, and if I had not interviewed all these people who have been through these eruptions in their respective countries, I myself would probably be more emotionally inclined to find a sort of very elegant theoretical synthesis that allows for the incorporation of everything, rather than come to a set of sort of like, in some cases a little bit, hopefully sensitive, but perhaps slightly crude conclusions. Because the people that I met around the world have seen what is on the other side of apparent success. Some of the people that have lived through the other side of that apparent initial victory come down much more harshly on horizontalism than I do in the conclusion. They are often like really angry when the word comes up. One major interlocutor that I didn't even quote because I thought it would be like sort of too hard said “I've come to the conclusion horizontalism is evil”. But OK, you ask if there's something more than just the failure in the Soviet Union? Absolutely, I think you're right. I think there's a number of things, and hopefully they all become clear by the end of the book, but some of them I put at the beginning and some I only hint to at the end. I do think that yes, in, you know, starting the second-half of the century in the 20th century in Western Europe and especially the United States any kind of association with the Soviet Union, as a result of not only McCarthyism but Hungary 1956, became something that many, many thinkers and activists wanted to avoid, for I think both ideological and material reasons; like it was either your career, your life could be destroyed if you were at all associated with official Marxist-Leninist doctrine. But then also by ‘58, that model there's something stale and uninspiring, unimpressive about what was actually happening in the Soviet Union. So yes, that absolutely happens. Then in 1989 to 1991, the actual thing falls apart. So that seems like pretty good proof to people that were already inclined to believe, so that that model was discredited, that there was nothing that was worth saving. And that everything about it needed to be reversed like there was kind of an undialectical simple inversion not among everybody, but some people thought, OK, let's just do the exact opposite of the thing that they did, and that's going to work. But there are also real material forces that end up constituting a particular configuration of global neoliberal society, in that same ideological moment in the quote unquote, end of history that we can say is perhaps between 1990 and maybe 2011, whether it's Occupy or Tahrir Square. In that same ideological epoch we are also being more individualised than ever; we are separated from any type of collective action with other human beings, we are separated from organisations, not only just formal, you know, capital organisations, we're often just like physically alone a lot. There's the illusion of connectedness, because we're all looking at each other's posts all the time. But we're really sitting alone and just sort of responding to what we see on screens, we are interpellated by society as individuals. This is something that comes up a lot in the literature on Bolsonaro and Rodrigo Nunes is a major interlocutor in the book. He talks about the idea of ‘neoliberalism from below’, the way in which the classic Bolsonarista subject views himself or herself – largely himself – as like an individual firm, like as an entrepreneur, or as like a ‘business of one’ rather than as a member of any given community. So I think all these things, these ideological material factors, along with the concrete decimation of the organisations which would have been actual protagonists for social uprisings in the 20th century. Parties, unions, social movements, even like community organisations, civil, you know, neighbourhoods, all of the kind of things that would have been the natural protagonists in the 20th century. All of this adds up to what I described at the beginning. Which is that a particular response to injustice is the most available. It is the one that appears possible and ready to hand when something horrible or horrifying happens, and it's not only that ‘Oh, I read that the history, you know, that the Soviet Union was bad and it didn't work anyway so we should do the opposite’, but also that I view myself as an individual. I believe that I, like everybody else, should be the leader of everything and I, you know, I've never really engaged in any kind of actual collective action, except for perhaps like on the football pitch, when I was younger, we all had to implement the strategy that the coach came up with. So I think that all of this made this, as I said, the easiest option – it appeared to be the easiest option available. D Yeah, I’ve heard you talk elsewhere about individualization and that kind of subjectivity angle. To me that feels in my own organising like an important way of thinking through it, especially – I remember a moment in the book just briefly mentioned the backstory of the mayor [of Sao Paolo] Haddad talking about ‘Marxist pizza parties’… and it's a tiny detail, and I think easily overlooked in the grand scope and historic movements of all you cover, but for some reason it's really stayed with me. Yeah, those spaces, as you say, we're not occupying the same physical spaces anymore. And yeah, just the general direction of society seems to lend itself to certain political forms. If we can zoom in a little to look at tactics as opposed to strategy, you talk about protest as being a kind of fundamentally communicative action. And this is something I can relate to a lot. I was on the XR UK press team for a while, and so we would often sit back before actions were planned and or during and we would say ‘how much coverage is this getting’ – and then crucially afterwards everyone would always ask like ‘Oh well did this action succeed’? Look at the headlines. Are there enough of them or are there not? If that's not a sufficient model, which I assume it isn't, then what criteria would you suggest as alternatives to measuring an action’s impact as opposed to coverage? V No, I think that that is sufficient when you’re talking about protest. And so, sort of this strange phenomenon around which my book is built is what happens when a protest stops being a protest. What happens when there is the shift between the quantitative to the qualitative right, like a quantitative increase effects the qualitative transformation of the phenomenon. So the fact that the protest is a communicative action – there's no problem whatsoever. It's actually good. I think it's great to be aware of that as you evaluate the best strategies, evaluate who you're trying to communicate to, how you want to communicate, the force with which you want that message to land and so on. What happens often in the book is that now there is a protest that so many people join that it becomes a revolutionary situation. And at that point… sometimes there's no one left to communicate to. I mean, this is a strange moment in some of the cases in the book that actually the protests continued acting like a protest when there was no longer anyone to protest. Like the government was gone, the government had jumped on a plane. And you know, the dictator had fled the country. There was an actual power vacuum, and yet this communicative action continued because it was what people knew how to do, and there had been no plan for like setting up a revolutionary committee or a meeting of civil society organisations to plan for a transition. And I'm not faulting them for not planning for that because no one had seen coming the size of the explosion. In that moment, I think you need something different. D Interesting. If I can risk putting that, like, essentially revolutionary context into dialogue with what I'm more used to, which is the kind of global north climate movement debates of what do we do next week, what is this thing we've just done worth then… I think our banner tactic at the moment, speaking as the climate movement generally, is the sort of ‘art attack’ – the soup on a painting tactic. Which I enjoy how incongruous this sounds having heard about like, ‘oh, well, we didn't topple the regime’, etcetera. But I think there's a sort of productive tension there in that it's just such a different context here. We're not talking about, I mean – and I realise these things can creep up on you, but – you know the day-to-day, week-to-week tactical level, strategic level we're operating on is this question of how can we get maximum coverage. It's these made for media actions, often, is the model and the discussion is often like well should they be as I asked. So yeah, just within the global North context. You know, it's an example of collective action. It's a tactic. We've tried other forms and this is one that's sort of emerged to the fore partly because it's so sort of media ready. Just generally how do you feel about the art attacks, the soup on paintings? V I'm going to give you a long answer. So how do we evaluate it? Right. So one thing that I said in an interview with Jewish currents, with Alex Press, we came to the conclusion: if someone in power is doing something and you want them to stop: raising awareness, being right, proving to the world that what they're doing is bad – is not enough. If people in power are doing something and you want them to stop, you either need to take their power away or make it so it's in their best interest to change. To change their actions, right? So, in the short term, I think, maybe you might disagree, maybe people in your movement might disagree, but at least in the short term, I think states are going to be at the centre of whether or not the global economy transitions to a less destructive model or not. It is the existing set of states that comprise the global system. Is there whether we like it or not, and I think they're going to be there in crucial moments of a possible transition or non-transition into a less destructive economy. So, you know, raising awareness, proving that something is bad, proving that another option is possible can all be important ingredients in a recipe that either takes power away from specific individuals or makes it so it is in their best interest to change. And this is another one that I think, there are some elements on the anglophone left that shrink away from this, which is much less common in in South America, for example: the idea that changing a politician's behaviour is a loss that somehow if you can take an existing set of state actors and put enough pressure on them that they have to come around to some of your demands, that reaping that victory and walking away with those wins is somehow a defeat. I think this is something that is sort of like vestigial and I sort of grew up with this idea also: near the ‘end of history’ in the United States, like in any way caring about or interacting with the existing state is to weaken or to compromise your movement. But historically, if you can force people in power to change their actions because you've put pressure on them from below, that's a win and there's no reason that you have to, like, commit suicide immediately after you get one win. So soup on paintings - it really depends how it lands. It seems like the message that is transmitted to society is that there's a small group of young people that really, really want to stop and think about what's happening to the planet and really want you to stop and consider a shift away from a really destructive model, and I could see how that could be part of a larger set of practises and strategic orientation which gets more people involved in the movement or which gets politicians paying attention. Or which gets other solutions to appear more possible down the road. I could also see it annoying some people that you may need not necessarily to be on side because you never get them on side, but you know I don't care about annoying people compared to the destruction of the planet. When annoying somebody is effective – and sometimes annoying people is incredibly effective – sometimes being really annoying towards existing elites is how you get concessions from them and other times… so that's a long answer when really what I’m saying is it depends if it works. There is no ontologically progressive tactical form. There is nothing that you can do in any circumstance, and always it's good and there's nothing you can do in any circumstance, and it's always bad. It depends on its relation to a larger strategic orientation or to a larger project if it helps to either take someone’s power away or to make it in their interest to change their actions. D Speaking of world-systems, the Palestine movement has been happening recently. I was actually just involved in setting up an encampment in Edinburgh. So yeah, it's all going on. Do you feel like what you've been seeing suggests some lessons have been learned from the decade you cover? V Yes. So here’s the long answer once more. For most of the last six months – and just to be clear, I've been attending and supporting the Pro Palestine protest – for most of the last six months, I have been saying that they felt largely pre 2010s and post 2010s. Pre 2010s in the sense that they reminded me most of 2003 when I protested the war in Iraq. In the sense that a very clear message was delivered to elites, that message was received, and ignored. The protests remain communicative actions, quite effective communicative actions. Back in 2003, George Bush and Tony Blair got the message and chose to ignore it, this time Biden, Netanyahu, chose to ignore it. In other ways, I was saying that they were post 2010s in some ways because they seemed to be less concerned with the elevation of spontaneity and horizontality than many protests in the 2010s. That they came to some of the same conclusions as some of the interlocutors in my book. For example, one of the more impressive, one of the most effective I think communicative actions of the early anti war movement was the Jewish Voices for Peace action at Grand Central Station. And I don't know how many people, hundreds, thousands of people, showed up and they were all wearing T-shirts that said ‘Jews for Ceasefire’. This is like, if you want to do a close reading of what that is, that's a rejection of spontaneity because it can't be spontaneous that they made T-shirts. Right. This was a group that has known each other for, you know, sometimes decades. And they came together and they’re like, no, we know the media is going to lie about this. So we're going to make it impossible. They're going to say that we're anti-Semites, here to support Hamas. It's written on my chest: Jews for ceasefire. Right? So that seemed to be somewhat a move away from the elevation of spontaneity as an idea in itself. And then also, then the other aspect of this is more I think a consequence of the particular case. The particular content of the movement because you know often in the 2010s it was said, often you know this phrase was reproduced as if this was like this really cool post modern phenomenon that the protests had a ‘floating signifier’. Which meant that they could be about everything and nothing, and from one morning to the next, they could be about this or that. It seemed that quite a lot of people in the last six months have been very intentional about saying ‘No, we want to end the massacre of Palestinians right now’. You can't show up and say this is about legalising weed, right. But again, that's simplified with an anti war movement. Because when your government is helping another government to carry out crimes against humanity, it's very simple. It's very easy to you know, quote unquote, message discipline. It's very easy to come together and say we want you to stop that. Right? Whereas in June 2013 in Brazil, it was like well: why did this happen now? Like why even… you know, everyone maybe can bring their own complaints about society; whereas with an anti war movement, the protest form is very well suited because it's quite clear that if you're protesting the Vietnam War, the message is ‘stop the Vietnam War’. If you’re protesting Gaza the message is ‘stop helping Israel to massacre Palestinians’, right? So in those two senses, I thought it was somehow kind of quote unquote post 2010s. But then the Colombia crackdown, the NYPD Columbia crackdown reproduced many elements that were for the first time very reminiscent of the phenomenon in my book. Now what elements are reminiscent? One's a crackdown on vulnerable like a special demographic of the citizenry, which shocks the population and leads to outpouring of solidarity protests, right, so that the NYPD crackdown leads to a spread of the reproduction of the encampment tactic because of the crackdown, because of the shock of the NYPD cracking down – I think everybody largely agrees unnecessarily – on students that are just trying to stop horrible war crimes from being committed. Then you get again the attempt, the very active attempt, to pick off unsympathetic elements within the protest movement and use it to impose a representation on the larger group. So like you immediately saw right wing media entrepreneurs showing up and trying to find the craziest person in Manhattan. And saying oh look I found this guy this is what the protests are all about. And again, the response to that seems to be very post-2010s. There's an article in the Atlantic. I don't know if you saw this article in the Atlantic, where it seems that what happened is journalists from the Atlantic went to the Colombia encampment and wanted to talk to everyone. And everyone in the encampment that he encountered said ‘We've appointed a media liaison. The person that we would like to speak with you today is this woman’. And he was really frustrated by this because I think that the Columbia students came to the conclusion, perhaps correctly, that he was there to find somebody to say something stupid, whereas they had decided in advance, and this is one of the lessons that comes up in the book, a movement that cannot speak for itself will be spoken for. They came up with the plan that like oh no, this woman is the woman that we’re gonna have speaking with the press today. She's the person that is the best at this, she's the person that we've decided on this job. And to some of the most extreme some of the proponents of the most pronounced version of horizontalism of the 2010s this itself would have been seen as verticality. Because, oh, this person is speaking for everybody else, and everyone is supposed to do everything and so on. So the last few weeks have started to reproduce some of the phenomena of the 2010s in ways that generate both opportunities and challenges. D You mentioned [Hannah Proctor’s] Burnout earlier; there’s also been Exhausted of the Earth floating around, which I'm sure you've come across and or read about. And I heard you in a different interview, talking about having some interviews which were too dark to feature in the book. I'm intrigued about the notes you don't play in the book as well. Like, burnout doesn't come across too strongly as a theme – there’s sort of some deft references – but that kind of emotional labour angle, is that something you were encountering a lot? V So there's a couple things that I looked at, but I don't really slam in the reader’s face. One is the depths of depression to which some of the interviewees fall. I think it's enough to sort of just say that this happens without really making the book about an investigation of those emotional states and what they mean and what they feel like, what they look like – that's another, that is and should be another great book and many other great books, it just wasn't what I was trying to get at. But not only was that not the main topic of the book, I felt that some of this stuff was actually far too horrible in person. Even if we were on the record. I kind of decided, yeah, you don't really, we don't really want that out there. And then another thing that was kind of only hinted at was that I didn't want to slap the reader in the face with was how actually like, angrily and like how often violently, some of the interviewees now reject horizontalism. Often, just like I mentioned, the word will bring a flash of anger, or like a look of deep concern to the faces of some of the interviewees. Again, this is something that I didn’t lean on, doesn’t seem like a productive representation. I didn't choose the most sensational, ideological transformations. I chose the ones that were most representative of the largest number of interviews, and presented soberly and I think in a way that people really would stand behind later rather than like sort of flashes of anger. D I suppose the reason I ask is because although you say, and I think you're right in terms of writing a book that is readable and has a particular thesis, yeah, the emotional side is not the point. But nonetheless, I think there is an intriguing overlap where this sort of intellectual sense making does always involve, necessarily, a big emotional component, whether that is negative, or hopefully – I mean hopefully there are some positive interviews of people who are like, yeah, I was empowered or I don't know, people who look back on them somewhat fondly. I mean, do you have that side as well? V Oh, yeah, yeah. This is in the book, that some people still say that this it's still the best day of my life. Like even though I know how it ended and how horrible the long term consequences were. I had a glimpse of something that day that made me feel more alive than anything else in my entire existence, and I'll be reliving it for the rest of my life and trying to learn what it means for the rest of my life. So absolutely. That tension, between the power of the experience and the very difficult intellectual and cognitive work of making sense of it, is something that I encountered. Yeah, across the world. D As a last question: how are you feeling personally about the future and state of the world? Not necessarily in that order. V Uhh… Again, we keep bringing up this phrase, ‘Whether we like it or not’. There are things that exist, whether we like it or not – and that is kind of the original practise of historical materialism, right, is not to be like ‘What do I wish the world was?’ It’s like well, what is it and how do we act upon it to make it as good as possible given the opportunities; and whether we like it or not, we are facing a set of very serious dangers. And perhaps some opportunities. It doesn't really matter if I wish that it was different - what matters is how we very seriously analyse what opportunities and dangers the given state of things offers. Things are a lot worse than I thought they might have been, in 2011. Should I quote unquote give up hope? Hope of what? Hope of the thing that I thought that might have been possible 15 years ago? That doesn't matter because we're all going to be living together on this planet whether we like it or not. We're going to be interacting with the global economic and political system that exists whether we like it or not. The point is to see how we can live best with each other and how best to act upon those systems to make them as good as possible given the contradictions and opportunities inherent in them. That's easy for me to say also – I know by global standards I lead an incredibly privileged life. But that's still my answer. I don't give in to despair at the state of the world because, like the state of the world, is the state of the world, and that's what we have to deal with.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/05/02/crossing-the-rubicon/,"Photo by Lalesh Aldarwish It was the 8th day of February in the year two thousand and twenty-four AD, and the world was in turmoil. In Eastern Europe and Africa the drums of war were beating. The Northern Atlantic Alliance and Russia and China glared at each other over the East/West divide, as tensions between the Great Powers intensified. And in the Middle East, man's inhumanity to man had become so severe that the highest court in the world was obliged to consider the charge of genocide. A cost of living crisis had been imposed through the political choices of Western governments upon the societies that considered themselves to be the most advanced. And in many households of Western Europe, the choice was between eating and heating. If you thought all of this would cause protest, you would be correct. In cities around the world thousands of people marched, and called for an end to war. Capitals rang with the chant of ""Ceasefire Now!"" In response politicians - their pockets lined by lobby groups and weapons manufacturers, and not wishing to be held to account - called for harsher and harsher measures to be taken against the dissenters, as country after country lurched towards fascism. The wars that raged were increasingly fought by machine, although they spilled human blood just the same. The rise of Artificial Intelligence meant that machines could fight your wars, cure your diseases or write you a note to inform your boss you had quit your job. Many people wondered where this strand of technological ""progress"" would end. Some even wondered if the machines would one day supplant humanity as the pre-eminent life form on Earth. And in the background it continued, barely noticed and seldom discussed: the greatest Mass Extinction of life on Earth for millions of years. The Extinction was itself like a vast machine of endlessly grinding gears, the levers of which were operated by that same human race, the architects of the Anthropocene epoch in which all now existed. Welcome to the Meta Crisis. Illustration by Cameron Shepherd So the announcement that was made that day, 8th February 2024 may have escaped the attention of many, as they worried about the prospect of worldwide conflict, as they cried for those who bore the cruelty of imperialism, as they fretted about how they could even put food on the table. It was an announcement that a boundary had been transgressed - a line that humanity had been warned not to cross - that for a full year, average global temperatures had been higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. What was the price that humanity could come to pay for breaching such a critical boundary? At best, so said the scientists, an irrevocable change in our existence; and repercussions which would include the permanent disruption of food supplies and the displacement of many millions of people seeking refuge from the swathes of the planet's surface which had been rendered unliveable by climate breakdown. And at worst, the complete breakdown of civilization, the disappearance of most of the lifeforms we currently share the planet with, and a human death toll far beyond the combined cost of the worst atrocities in history. And so, as evening approached on that day, perhaps the spirit of the author H G Wells could be invoked: ""It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling. Softened almost into melody by the distance.” ""It all seemed so safe and tranquil."" So that is the context against which we received this news. To all intents and purposes 1.5 degrees is gone. Yes, you can make objections to this assertion. It’s an El Niño year, and there may be fluctuations downwards that see the warming trend dip back below 1.5 degrees in the next few years. But ultimately with every COP disappointment, and the fact that we are yet to feel the full effect of the greenhouse gasses humanity has already released into the atmosphere, it’s time to face our failure. And, alas, there was an inevitability about this failure. Now we have to consider: Some of our colleagues will begin to prepare for the worst, with the aim of survival now taking precedence over any idealistic visions of the future: Deep Adaptation. And many of our colleagues, always defiant, will continue the fight. Extinction Rebellion was formed in the knowledge that there was never any guarantee of a happy ending. But that doesn’t mean we’ll turn away now. Yes, it may feel that this latest setback is too much to cope with, coming as it does on top of all of the suffering we see around the world, in Gaza, in Ukraine, in Yemen, in Sudan, in West Papua and many other places, and coming at the same time, as it does, as the incipient authoritarianism from a growing number of our own governments. There is a danger, and perhaps there always was, that we will lose some people by the wayside, so bleak is our outlook now. Now, more than ever, we need to keep sight of the better future for all life on our planet we’re seeking to create. “it’s so important to imagine a better world. Let your thoughts run wild with idealistic dreams of what the world should look like, and let the pain and anger at how it’s not that way flow through you. Let it free your mind and fuel your rage against the machine. It’s not too late for you or anyone. We can have the world of our dreams tomorrow, but we have to be willing to fight today.” - Aaron Bushnell This struggle will leave scars. And some scars, of the body, of the mind or of the heart, may not heal. But still we carry on. Still we rise. Keep in mind that, in the words of Greta Thunberg, “Every fraction of a degree matters - and will always matter"". This was never a battle for the faint of heart, or for minds given easily to despair. It is as true now as it was at the moment of its inception: there has never been a better time to Join The Rebellion. There is a darkness in our future. We knew that already, but now every day, and with ever greater clarity, we see that darkness bearing down on us. ""I have no hope that these changes can be reversed. We are inevitably sending our children to live on an unfamiliar planet. But the opposite of hope is not despair. It is grief. Even while resolving to limit the damage, we can mourn. And here, the sheer scale of the problem provides a perverse comfort: we are in this together. The swiftness of the change, its scale and inevitability, binds us into one, broken hearts trapped together under a warming atmosphere. We need courage, not hope. Grief, after all, is the cost of being alive. We are all fated to live lives shot through with sadness, and are not worth less for it. Courage is the resolve to do well without the assurance of a happy ending."" - Kate Marvel So grieve. It's alright to feel grief. Grieve and protect your mental health. Reach out to your family, to your loved ones, to your friends, and hold them close to you. And remember this: the one thing that counts above all, is kindness.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/04/12/global-newsletter-87/,"Octopussy Riot perform in the Total Energies section of an oil harbour in Denmark, part of the North Sea Fossil Free wave of actions across six countries. This issue: North Sea Fossil Free | Melbourne Rebellion | XR Ecuador | Dear rebel, Back in October of last year, around 400 activists including rebels blockaded a luxury hotel in central London that was hosting the ‘Oscars of Oil’ - a three-day summit for Big Oil executives to schmooze with politicians and dish out awards. The activists didn’t just come from different groups, they came from all across Europe, and a few of them sleeping overnight in the same church got talking. The protests by Fossil Free London had brought them together in the same city, but what if they coordinated a protest once they were all back in their different homelands? Just five months later, their idea was a reality, manifested as the North Sea Fossil Free campaign, with North Sea oil infrastructure being disrupted in six countries simultaneously. You can read all about the blockades, the boat mission, and the punk concert in Action Highlights. A Dutch Mer-rebel blockades Europe’s biggest oil refinery during the ‘North Sea Fossil Free’ campaign. There you can also read about how rebels in Melbourne, Australia brought their city to a slow-marching standstill, and exposed a shadowy network of oil-sponsored organisations that are demonising ecoactivists around the world. And finally you can find out why XR Ecuador are back out on the streets of Quito, and braving tear gas and police violence to demand that their corrupt government follow its own laws. When you attend a protest, it’s not just about the cause you believe in and the actions you are taking. It’s also about the people you meet and the kindred spirits you connect with. You never know where those connections might take you. For the new rebel network behind North Sea Fossil Free, this is only the beginning. This newsletter is available in multiple languages.

Donate What You Can 16 MARCH | Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden ‘Oil slick’ rebels visit the Scottish coastline for the North Sea Fossil Free campaign. Activists in six European countries bordering the North Sea have launched a new coordinated campaign to disrupt major fossil fuel infrastructure. Rebels teamed up with members of Scientist Rebellion, Ende Gelände, and Becoming Species under the banner ‘North Sea Fossil Free’ to blockade oil refineries, LNG terminals, and fossil fuel harbours, and even perform a punk concert on a shipping container! The governments of the six countries targeted by the campaign are allowing continuous new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, and in the process abandoning the limits on emissions set by the Paris Agreement. Counted as a single country, these North Sea exploiters would be the 7th largest oil and gas producer in the world, just behind China. North Sea oil infrastructure blockades in (clockwise from top right) Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Norway. In Denmark, punk band Octopussy Riot intruded upon a section of Esbjerg Harbour owned by Total Energies. They climbed atop a shipping container to perform a live concert of protest songs against the oil giant, which is planning to re-open the country’s largest gas field in the North Sea and exploit it for 25 years. German Ende Gelände activists blocked access to a floating LNG terminal in the industrial port of Brunsbüttel for six hours, demanding an immediate end to imports of liquified natural gas, which is more harmful to the climate than coal. In the Netherlands, Scientist Rebellion joined rebels to block all the access roads, and even the train tracks, into Shell’s Pernis refinery, the largest oil refinery in Europe. As well as expanding production in the North Sea, Shell is allowing its old drilling platforms and pipes to just rust away, poisoning the sea with mercury, radioactive lead, and polonium. XR Norway sailed into enemy territory to disrupt two oil tankers. Only one escaped. Norwegian rebels braved a snowstorm to disrupt Rafnes Petroleum Refinery, sailing a boat into its security zone and forcing one oil tanker to dock, while a land-based group blocked the refinery’s main entrance. Meanwhile, in Sweden, rebels blocked the road to Gothenburg’s Oil Harbour for the entire day. And finally, local rebel groups in Scotland dropped banners and staged an ‘oil slick’ performance at sites linked to Rosebank, the biggest undeveloped oil and gas field in the North Sea. Last year, Rosebank was green-lit for development by the UK government. The ‘North Sea Fossil Free’ campaign was the work of a new activist network born during the Fossil Free London actions in October. After this inspiring debut, plans are already being drawn for a second wave of actions, and more rebel groups want to be involved next time. 12–16 MARCH | Melbourne, Australia Red Rebels and a giant koala join a Melbourne slow-march. Photo: Danielle Judd Australian rebels took to the streets of Melbourne’s central business district over five consecutive days to Rebel For Life and demand that their government declare a climate and ecological emergency. At least 27 activists were arrested by police, who were deployed in excessive numbers throughout the week of non-violent protest. Inspired by Just Stop Oil in the UK, and bolstered by hundreds of rebels willing to risk arrest, XR Victoria set off each day for an early morning slow-march. After disrupting peak hour traffic, rebels took part in some dancing DISCObedience, formed mothers’ circles, and staged sit-ins. The final day of rebellion saw rebels rally outside the doors of a think-tank, the Institute of Public Affairs – part of the aggressively anti-protest and Big Oil funded Atlas Network. This shadowy cabal of more than 500 think-tanks has been instrumental in discrediting climate science, stalling state-level climate action, and demonising climate activists around the world. Rebel For Life photos: Julian Meehan, Matt Hrkac, Danielle Judd. The rally was followed by a final slow-march to Flinders Street Station, Australia’s second-busiest train station, where hundreds of rebels who were willing to risk fines or possible arrest sat in the road. Police hauled them away, one by one. Days before the Rebel For Life rebellion started, three rebels brought several lanes of traffic to a standstill on Melbourne’s busy West Gate Bridge, with two of them later sentenced to two months in prison. As in many parts of the world, police response and judicial sentencing have been growing harsher and more disproportionate across Australia. The Atlas Network has without a doubt played a part in that. Find out more about XR Victoria’s Rebel For Life campaign. 4, 12–13, 27 MARCH | Quito, Yasuní & Palo Quemado, Ecuador Rebels, anti-mining groups, and indigenous activists march through Quito to the national court to demand an end to illegal gas flares in Yasuní National Park. Corporations and their government enablers want to keep the ecocidal reality of extractivism hidden, but rebels in Ecuador are exposing the truth. The Ecuadorian government is callously pursuing metal and fossil fuel extraction without democratic consent, tear-gassing peaceful protestors in full view, and doing far worse to remote frontline communities. In the Cotopaxi region, where Canadian firm Atico Mining plans to extract gold and copper at the expense of a key water source, repression has been intensifying. Ecuadorian law requires mining corporations to consult with impacted communities before starting operations. But when the Palo Quemado community in Cotopaxi attempted to exercise this right, police responded like Atico Mining henchmen, attacking more than 100 people and labelling them terrorists. One person was hospitalised and remains in critical condition. The Palo Quemado in the Cotopaxi region have been subject to police violence for resisting a Candanian-owned mega-mine on their land. Refusing to let this violence stand, rebels and members of an anti-mining coalition joined with indigenous groups for solidarity actions in Quito, starting with a protest in front of the Canadian Embassy. Officials took note, as became apparent later that month. Surrounded by press on a busy city street, police bombarded rebels and onlookers with tear gas during a peaceful sit-in at the Ministry of the Environment. “Something like this, in front of the media and the public, hasn’t happened in a long time in the city,” said a rebel from Quito. The protesters managed to stay calm, regrouped, and continued with their planned rally. XR Ecuador and anti-mining allies protest outside the Canadian Embassy. Illegal mining isn’t XR Ecuador’s only ongoing struggle. In a historic referendum in 2023, Ecuadorian citizens voted massively in favour of keeping over 726 million barrels of oil in the ground under the Amazonian Yasuní National Park. Celebrated as a climate victory around the world, the reality on the ground is that the battle to preserve this region, the most biodiverse in the world, is far from over. Petroecuador, the state oil company, has actually ramped up extraction since the referendum, reaching a new peak production in 2023. In Yasuní alone, Petroecuador operates more than 400 gas flares, many beside the houses of indigenous people. The flares cause cancer, decimate biodiversity, and emit more than 100 million tons of greenhouse gases each year. A successful lawsuit against the government to remove the flares was filed by Las Nueve Niñas, a group of young women from Yasuní. Yet three years later, the flares are still there, and the government is trying to wriggle free of the court’s order. Rebels co-organized a march through Quito to demand compliance with the court, joined by Las Nueve Niñas and 300 more activists, and followed it with a sit-in at the national court. More actions are planned for May and June to pressure the government to stay true to its word, follow its own laws, and accept that Ecuador is not for sale.

Meanwhile, rebels in Goma are reporting that oil giant Perenco has withdrawn its bid for a series of oil blocks in DRC, a potentially major victory in the struggle to stop more ecocide in one of the most plundered nations on the planet. 9 MAR | Global: Mothers* Rebellion hold a 4th global rebellion, with mothers and their allies forming protest circles in more than 90 cities across 30 countries.

The play explores the lethal consequences of ignoring science for profit, and some critics mistook the disruption as part of the performance. The play’s star actor later said that he supported the action. 22–24 MAR | Jáchal, Argentina: Rebels join activists from across Argentina at the Puentes de Agua (Bridges of Water) festival in Jáchal. The town has been devastated by Canadian-owned gold and uranium mining, with multiple cyanide spills and the local river drying up completely. Local activists are now trying to stop the José María Project, which will extract copper, gold and silver using 30 times more water than previous mining projects. The government promised development in the region in exchange for extractivism, but the town has been left with only an empty hospital and no medical staff. Rebels rallied in solidarity with the locals, demanding that mining be banned in the region. Water is worth more than gold! 23 MAR | Donges, France: To celebrate Total Energies 100-year anniversary, XR Nantes launched their circus of climate disorder at France’s 2nd largest oil refinery. The circus featured many, many rebel clowns, all of whom condemned the oil giant’s continuing development of EACOP and 16 other climate bombs that will blow up the Paris Agreement. If it doesn’t agree to abandon fossil fuels at its AGM in May, French rebels will launch a large action to demand Total Energies’ liquidation. 25 MAR | Vienna, Austria: Rebels and Debt4Climate activists abseil down Vienna’s Business School, where a major gas conference was planned but ultimately postponed, and unveil a huge ‘End Fossil Crimes’ banner. The activists jointly called for an end to fossil capitalism, and debt cancellation for the Global South. 26 MAR | London, UK: Ocean Rebellion target a Tesco supermarket in central London for selling John West tuna, who source their yellowfin tuna from Spanish fisheries that routinely trap and slaughter turtles, sharks & whales. Learn more about their disgusting and indiscriminate fishing practises. 28 MAR | Brussels, Belgium: Rebels and activists from TotalementDown blockade the entrance of Marsh McLennan, the insurance broker for Total Energies’ EACOP project. The Insure Our Future campaign continues! This book's title is precisely descriptive. Ms. Walter simply summarizes the vast modern scholarship on which factors make a country more likely to descend into civil war and/or genocide and why. Ms. Walter doesn't write much about climate change, and yet anyone who cares about climate change would do well to read her book. War in general is bad for the planet and for people already at high risk from climate change. Worse, a country preoccupied by civil war will not engage in climate action. According to Ms. Walter, the United States is especially vulnerable to civil war now. That would be disastrous for everybody. So civil war needs to be on our collective radar. But as Ms. Walter makes clear, it's possible to accidentally play into somebody else's plans for destabilisation. As activists, we need to understand how to avoid doing that. Reading this book might help. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops. Buy books at Bookshop or Hive. Octopussy Riot turn oil infrastructure into their stage for 'North Sea Fossil Free'. Report: Troubled Waters - How North Sea Countries Fuel Climate Disaster Oil Change International show how the oil and gas policies of North Sea countries (Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, UK) do not align with the Paris Agreement, how production will be ongoing in 2050, and how they would rank as the 7th largest oil and gas producer in the world if combined, just behind China. Video: What Economists Don’t Know About Climate Science Can Kill Us Scientist Rebellion interview Professor Steve Keen who talks in a frank and occasionally hilarious manner about how little economists understand the climate crisis, and how this ignorance has fuelled wildly inappropriate economic policies. Article: Antarctic ice explains dip in CO2 levels of C.16th/17th There's long been a debate about why there was a big decline in atmospheric CO2 in the 16th and 17th centuries. Thanks to a new ice core analysis by Dr Amy King, we now have the answer: colonialism. Yes, Europeans killed so many indigenous people in the Americas that forests regrew and the atmosphere cooled. Chilling. Article: Civil Disobedience Increases Climate Change Concern in Germany A new academic paper investigates whether concerns about climate change increase following demonstrative protests and confrontational acts of civil disobedience in Germany. The resounding answer is, yes it does. Keep doing what you’re doing, rebels. XR Global Support has launched a new crowdfunding campaign for 2024. As the name suggests, XR Global Support supports rebel groups around the world, prioritising those in the Global South which are most affected by the climate crisis. Your donations will be turned into grants for rebel actions, global media channels to amplify them, and secure comms for rebels to organise safely wherever they live. So please give what you can, and thank you for your support. Coming Soon Activist turned filmmaker, Rich Felgate, award-winning director of FINITE, has spent the last two years filming people on the frontlines of climate protests in the UK for a forthcoming feature documentary EVERYTHING IS FINE. The film tells the inside story of how far activists in Just Stop Oil will go to stop new oil and gas, and how far the government will go to stop them. Filming is almost complete, but the filmmakers need to crowdfund £70,000 to finish the edit and share this urgent film with the world.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/03/15/global-newsletter-86/,"Police arrest some very dangerous ‘Dirty Scrubbers’ before a day of action against insurance companies in the heart of London, UK. This issue: Insure Our Future! | DRC vs Green Growth | Founder of XR Zambia Dear rebel, Without insurance, fossil fuel projects like oil pipelines and coal mines can’t operate. And just 20 companies insure 70% of all fossil fuel projects. Yet these corporate linchpins to our ecocidal system have mostly flown under the radar. Until now. For one week, thousands of activists launched a hundred coordinated actions targeting major insurance companies right across the globe, demanding that they pull the plug on the fossil fuel industry. And at least some insurance executives were listening. Find out more about the Insure Our Future campaign, and the precious victories, in Action Highlights. An activist pours ‘oil’ onto money during an Insure Our Future rally in Indonesia. You can also read a Special Report about how rebels in the DRC are coping with war on their doorstep. A brutal Rwandan-backed militia has invaded the mineral-rich east of the country, displacing more than 10 million people. We speak to members of XR Goma University as the militia approach their city. In Action Round Up we cover the return of A12 blockades by Dutch rebels, the continuing protection of arctic wetlands by Finnish rebels, and many more inspiring acts of disruption by rebels around the world. And finally in Humans of XR we speak to the founder of XR Zambia about her journey into ecoactivism. Insurance companies are meant to protect us from risk, not pave the way to a world completely overrun with it. As long as the industry keeps backing ecocidal fossil fuel projects, we must keep disrupting their business and holding their executives to account. No insurance, no drilling. No justice, no peace.

Donate What You Can 26 FEB–3 MARCH | Global Insure Our Future, a worldwide coalition of activist groups, has finished a week of action that saw rebels occupy buildings and stage performances around the globe to highlight how the often-overlooked insurance industry facilitates the climate crisis. Rebels joined thousands of activists in 31 countries spread across every continent bar Antarctica to launch actions targeting major insurance firms. And some of those actions resulted in precious victories. Due to a lack of transparency in the insurance industry, it is not always clear which projects are backed by which companies. But what is clear is that most insurance firms are prioritising unethical and downright hypocritical policies that are damaging communities in every region of the world. Rallies in (clockwise from top left) Switzerland, Uganda, Nigeria, USA. American homeowners are increasingly being told that their properties, damaged by extreme weather, are ‘uninsurable’ - while new infrastructure for the nation’s liquified methane gas exports is readily covered. Grassroots organisations in Texas and Louisiana peacefully occupied the Houston lobbies of Chubbs and AIG to condemn these major insurers for enabling emissions while dismissing the consequences. In London, rebels allied with various organisations to occupy the offices of five major insurance companies, and later an 800-strong Carbon Bomb Defusal Squad linked hands around insurer Llyod’s of London to block anyone from entering. Insurance executives were targeted after work too, with rebels visiting local pubs to strike up chats with them about climate change. In a sign of how repressive the UK is becoming, a greenwashing performance by the ‘Dirty Scrubbers’ was abandoned after they and their greenwashing machine were arrested en route. But XR UK’s impressive campaign did bear fruit - the CEO of insurance company Zurich is due to hold talks with activists, and insurer Probitas has withdrawn support for the Pan-African-pipeline EACOP and a new UK coal mine. Rallies against Tokio Marine in (clockwise from top left) Pakistan, Japan, South Korea, The Philippines. The call to abandon EACOP echoed around the world, with Fridays for Future Uganda staging a special dance performance and Stop EACOP activists in Tanzania calling on Chinese state-backed insurers to drop the ecocidal project. Tokio Marine was singled out by activists across Asia, including in Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan and Japan for its support of global coal production and its withdrawal from the Net Zero Insurance Alliance after pressure from fossil fuel lobbyists. There were more than 100 actions over the week - too many for one newsletter. But it’s clear Insure Our Future has mobilised an incredible campaign, and applied the right kind of pressure on an industry that’s spent too long flying under the radar.

JAN / FEB | Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Activists in Goma denounce state and international inaction after savage attacks by a Rwandan-backed militia. Photo: LuchaCongo.org “Inside every phone there is the blood of a Congolese person.” These words from a rebel in Goma, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), encapsulate the deadly links between war, the plunder of resources, and climate breakdown. Nowhere is this more devastatingly clear than in the DRC, where M23 militias financed by the Rwandan government, which is in turn funded by the UK, the USA, and many others, are committing mass murder and ecological destruction as they surge into the east of the country. On the rare occasion that the mainstream media covers the DRC, it is portrayed as a poor nation with a “complicated” conflict-riven backstory. But this framing omits the catalyst for the region’s violence since its colonisation - resource robbery. “The conflict, which has persisted in the east of the DRC for almost 30 years, and is the deadliest since the Second World War, is mainly economic,” explains Nobel Laureate Dr. Mukwege. Since 1996, more than 10 million people have been killed, with countless more being displaced, raped, or forcibly recruited (even as children!) into armed groups. “The illegal trade in minerals is recognized as a root cause.” On International Women's Day, Congolese activists in the city of Beni demand justice for the women suffering violence in DRC. Photo: @luchaRDC The current fighting has now displaced more than 10 million people, triggering another wave of indiscriminate killings, mass rape, and disease, while militia armies ransack the country’s rainforests with illegal logging and poaching. Though the Congolese people have long been vampirized by extractivism, with over 70% living on less than $1.90/day, the DRC is actually the world's richest country in terms of wealth in natural resources. DRC’s fossil fuels have been exploited by foreign corporations for decades. In 2023, rebels from XR University of Goma travelled thousands of kilometres across the country, mobilising communities to oppose the sale of new oil and gas blocks, most of which overlap protected areas and would be linked to the ecocidal EACOP pipeline. Today, Goma’s activists are spending long hours caring for the massive influx of internally displaced people amid food shortages and cholera outbreaks. Others in their networks have been displaced and suffered violence and even death. For Congolese rebels, the struggle for environmental justice and the struggle against repeated cycles of violent resource plundering is one and the same. A rally in Nairobi, Kenya calls out Rwandan aggression in DRC. Photo: @luchaRDC As global finance gears up for “green growth”, the DRC’s resource wealth has again brought violence to its door. The world's largest coltan reserves, vast caches of copper, diamonds, tin, gold, and more than 63% of global cobalt are prized by armed gangs who sell them to corporations and wealthy states wanting to manufacture phones, computers, batteries and increasingly, renewable energy technologies. In the chaos orchestrated by the militias, minerals are more easily syphoned to Rwanda, where they are exported. The US Treasury estimated that last year more than 90% of DRC’s gold was smuggled to countries including Rwanda and Uganda, where it is refined and exported, mainly to the United Arab Emirates. Rwanda is also somehow the world’s primary exporter of coltan, despite being one of the lowest mineral producers in Africa. Without conflict minerals, the numbers just don’t add up. In a solidarity action both outside and inside the UK’s Parliament, rebels denounced the UK government for giving Rwanda vast sums to service its extreme asylum policies, and therefore indirectly enabling the theft of $24 trillion in natural resources from the DRC. Rebels outside the UK Parliament protest the financing of violence in the DRC. International donors see Rwanda as a useful regional power through which to carry on plundering Africa. Its economy is growing, and its infrastructure is developing at speed. Yet this growth has only benefitted a tiny elite, and the Rwandan government has become increasingly authoritarian, with mounting human rights abuses. “We see the height of cynicism in terms of geostrategy and a policy of double standards” says a rebel in Goma. “We see what is happening in Ukraine, what is happening in Gaza. Why not what is happening in the DRC? Why aren’t there sanctions against Rwanda, which officially, visibly, supports these militias?” Rebels in DRC are urgently calling for a green transition that puts justice first, not new revenue streams, and that dismantles colonial exploitation once and for all. Otherwise, our green transition will turn red with the blood of Congolese men, women, and children - collateral damage to enrich the same old racist elites.

This was the 36th rebel blockade of the motorway, but the first since the Dutch parliament agreed to reappraise and even abolish certain subsidies back in October 2023. Since then, the Dutch Senate voted against any change, and it has been business as usual. Later in the month, 40 rebels blockaded the Finance Ministry for its subsidy inaction. Another A12 blockade has been announced for the 6th April. 4 FEB | Kigali, Rwanda: Activists with Scientist Rebellion protest outside the Ugandan High Commission and the DRC Embassy to call for an end to both EACOP and the auctions of DRC peatlands for oil exploration. 9 FEB | Johannesburg, South Africa: XR Gauteng protests outside Standard Bank’s HQ to demand it stop backing the vast oil pipeline EACOP as well as various gas and coal projects across Africa. Police swarmed the small, peaceful protest, but the rebels promised to return every Friday until the bank meets its demands. 13 FEB | Budapest, Hungary: Rebels confront the president of Shell Hungary as he speaks at Corvinus University, and are (depressingly) dragged away by fellow students.

Rebels in Turin (pictured), Milan, Bologna, Treviso, Rome, Udine, Bari and Palermo used ironic street performances to remind people about the record temperatures, floods and droughts that have battered the country over the last year. 17–29 FEB | Viiankiaava, Finland: Rebels use steel tubes, locks and tripods to repeatedly shut down an exploratory drilling site in arctic wetlands in Northern Finland. The mining industry wants to extract nickel and copper from the protected nature reserve, and XR Elokapina is continuing its incredible campaign to stop them. Relaxed safety guidelines, riot fences, and constant security personnel have made their work harder, but the rebels from Finland and Sweden continue to disrupt the drill rigs, skiing to the site in teams as big as 40 and as small as one. 1 MARCH | Buenos Aires, Argentina: Rebels join an alliance of protesters outside the National Congress to keep a close watch on their new President during his state-of-the-union style speech. He recently called Congress a “nest of rats” after it rejected his ecocidal Omnibus law that would have let corporations plunder the country’s natural resources with impunity. Meanwhile, his severe economic cuts have led to rocketing inflation and soaring poverty across Argentina. 2 MAR | Berlin, Germany: Inspired by XR Netherlands’ campaign, a ""Stop Fossil Subsidies"" alliance, including rebels, blockade a main road. 400 activists called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies and denounced plans for a motorway expansion in the area. For every €13bn of German taxes spent on environmental protection, at least €48bn is spent on environmentally harmful subsidies. 2 MAR | Brussels, Belgium: Inspired by XR Netherlands’ campaign, and joined by visiting Dutch rebels, XR Belgium also demands an end to fossil fuel subsidies! 150 rebels disrupted city traffic until they were encircled by riot police and forced onto the pavement. Elections are imminent in the country, and rebels have plans for a wave of actions until voting day. Photo: @Engrainagemedia 2 MAR | Lyon, France: 400 activists from XR Lyon and Youth For Climate Lyon visit Arkema, a factory that produces PFAS aka forever chemicals, which have contaminated the rivers, soil, and drinking water of the region. Activists scaled the building, dropped banners, updated the company logo, and blockaded entrances. An army of riot police arrived to protect the ecocidal company, and they used tear gas, pepper spray, and truncheons to clear the protest, causing three serious injuries. 4 MAR | Dublin, Ireland: Rebels rally with the Grim Reaper outside a banking conference sponsored by JP Morgan, the world’s worst bank when it comes to fossil fuel investments since the Paris Agreement.

I set up XR Zambia in 2018, not long after Extinction Rebellion first appeared. I was not completely new to climate activism, as I had got involved with Citizens’ Climate Lobby here in Lusaka where I live. When we first got XR Zambia up and running, many people joined us, though the last few years it has been harder to sustain big numbers. Even so, there is a core team of about 20 of us, and we work hard planning actions and educating our fellow citizens about the causes and impacts of climate change. I have been aware of the climate and ecological crisis for a long time. I grew up in a village on the edge of a large forest, and as I got older I saw that it was becoming more and more depleted. My activism really started there, with reforestation: getting local people to plant a tree for every tree they cut down. There has been more flooding in my home village in recent years, and my father’s house was destroyed by one particularly bad flood. Droughts are also worsening, and all of this is raising the price of food. Many people do not have enough to eat, and many girls cannot study at school as they are simply too hungry. What feels very hard is that Zambia has contributed so little to greenhouse gas emissions, but we are suffering so badly. Anxiety is very high here, as we are facing more, and worse, droughts, floods, crop failure. Sometimes all of this makes me want to give up on activism – there is so much suffering. But then it also makes me carry on, because we must keep fighting to end this suffering and make our lives better. We have no choice. In XR Zambia we work on many areas, including clear water access, plastic pollution, and climate education. At the moment, we are focusing a lot on debt cancellation, because a country like mine can’t do much about the climate crisis while weighed down by so much foreign debt. More than a third of Zambia’s annual budget goes on debt repayments. So we are fighting, alongside Debt for Climate, to get this unjust debt cancelled by the IMF, the World Bank, and corporations like BlackRock. We wanted to stage an action in central Lusaka as part of the Insure Our Future campaign, but we couldn’t go ahead as the police would not give us a permit to protest. However, I was part of a Mothers* Rebellion action on International Women’s Day, and in April we are organising a march with Debt for Climate to coincide with an IMF and World Bank meeting. We will march again on African Liberation Day in May. The situation is very hard, but I keep fighting and hoping that we will get the debt cancelled, stop polluting the planet, and make things much better for us and for our children.

Report: The Insurers Secretly Backing the US Methane Gas Boom The Rainforest Action Network and Public Citizen reveal how at least 35 global insurance companies are underwriting liquified methane infrastructure across the US Gulf South that, if built, will export the same yearly emissions as 239 coal plants. Report: The Fraud of Plastic Recycling In the same month that microplastics were found in every human placenta tested in a study, the Centre for Climate Integrity released a report on how Big Oil and the plastics industry have promoted recycling for more than 50 years, while knowing it is not a viable solution to plastic waste. How disgusting can these people get? Music Video: Bosembo by Ben Kamuntu & Ben Man (4 mins) This powerful song by members of Goma Slam Session, a collective of young poets and rappers from the DRC, is part of a campaign to seek justice for the crimes committed in the country from 1993 to date, including those documented in the UN Congo Mapping Project report. Report: UN Global Resources Outlook 2024 Global extraction of natural resources will increase by 60% by 2060, with calamitous consequences for the climate and the environment. That’s the headline of this new UN report. The stripping of Earth’s raw materials has soared by almost 400% since 1970, and is already responsible for 60% of global heating impacts, 40% of air pollution impact, and more than 90% of global water stress and biodiversity loss. Seriously people, either capitalism dies or we do.

Photo: Mika Baumeister This issue: XR Finland vs Mining | XR Austria vs Tunnel Spider | USA Stops LNG? Dear rebel, In 2015, world leaders agreed to sweeping cuts in carbon emissions so that global temperatures would not rise by more than 1.5°C. The Paris Agreement set this cap because beyond 1.5°C, the impacts of global warming became much more extreme. But global warming has now exceeded 1.5°C for an entire year, and in that time the world has been hit by relentless extreme weather. The Paris Agreement has done nothing for the 133 people killed by unprecedented forest fires in Chile this month, or the 53,000 Indonesians forced to flee their homes after flooding from torrential rains. And the Paris Agreement has done little to the policies of the governments that signed it. Based on current emissions, the world is still heading for 3°C of warming by the end of the century. These are dark days for humanity, but this newsletter does contain a couple of reasons to keep the flame of hope alive. An Austrian rebel scales a lamppost during an action against the Tunnel Spider. Firstly, we have the rare sight of something positive happening in American politics, with the President announcing a pause on new liquified natural gas terminals until the climate impacts are better understood. The news was met with both joy and scepticism by US activists, and is analysed in our Special Report. Secondly, we have the reassuringly common sight of rebels putting their bodies and freedom on the line to protect their corner of the world from extraction and further emissions. Find out why Finnish rebels braved temperatures of -25°C, and why Austrian rebels are fighting a spider with a dinosaur, in Action Highlights. Finnish rebels use skis to access a mining drill site in a remote nature reserve. If you’re still feeling despair that we’ve collectively blown our chance for a stable future (fair enough) then turn that despair into action. Whoever you are, wherever you are, you’ll find two upcoming global campaigns you can join, and rebel roles you can volunteer for, in Announcements. 1.5°C is dead. But what matters isn’t the passing of a numerical threshold - it’s ending fossil fuels and making our civilization sustainable. Every step on that road keeps the world a little cooler, and the future a little less frightening. This newsletter is available in multiple languages.

Braving deep snow and freezing -25°C temperatures, a group of rebels has spent the last month (plus a week in December) interrupting mining exploration in a nature reserve in northern Finland. Viiankiaapa is a beautiful stretch of marshland and lake-dotted forest in eastern Lapland, home to many endangered plant and animal species, and officially protected by both Finnish and EU law. But British-listed mining corporation Anglo American has a licence to ‘explore’, and is intent on drilling beneath the old trees and fragile fenland soils for copper and nickel, which exist in abundance in the area. Although they are not currently allowed to extract the metals, there is widespread concern that Anglo American will succeed in changing Finnish law, and unleash a wave of extraction in once protected areas. The mining company has been working for years to achieve this, indulging in ever more greenwashing to make their case. Elokapina’s cycle: infiltrate drill sites, scale machinery, get arrested, go to jail. Courageous members of Elokapina (XR Finland) are putting their bodies in the way to stop a round of test drilling. To reach this remote, dark, snow-clad destination, they had to use cross-country skis and set up camp near the drilling area, using special clothing and sleeping bags to make the bitingly cold temperatures survivable. From their base, they have repeatedly sneaked into the mining site, scaling fences, climbing onto machinery, and locking on for periods as long as five hours. Each time, Anglo American has been forced to halt drill activity in line with their own health and safety code. Since mid-December, several of the rebels have been arrested, held overnight in jail, and fined. Most have then made their way back to the camp, ready to continue the cycle of disruption and arrest. Unhappy with the nearest police station being an hour’s drive away, Anglo American have recently brought in increasingly aggressive private security guards who have shoved rebels and hit their cameras away. Despite the intense cold, darkness, and aggressive security, these plucky rebels are not budging. They will be as disruptive as possible until 15th March, when Anglo American must stop work in time for the nesting season of rare local birds. And rebels are planning a big surprise for the company before then - so watch this space. Follow Elokapina’s (XR Finland’s) campaign on Twitter/X and Instagram. 12 & 31 JANUARY | Vorarlberg, Austria A rebel alliance protests against the Tunnel Spider, a car-boosting mega-project. Main roads linking Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland all meet in the Austrian border town of Feldkirch, and traffic jams have been a problem there for decades. But instead of investing in badly-needed public transport, local authorities decided to pour hundreds of millions of euros into a vast underground roundabout system, which will increase capacity for cars. A first exploration tunnel has already been dug. ""We're in a climate crisis, and it’s crazy to burn money for fossil projects”, says our contact from XR Vorarlberg, the province where Feldkirch is located. “We’re proposing a number of better ideas for the exploration tunnel, like turning it into a huge farm for locally grown mushrooms.” Rebels call the ecocidal mega-project Tunnel Spider. As well as evoking the fitting image of a hidden, menacing, multi-legged creature, the name handily “angers those who are trying to market the project as something good.” Rebels with their dinosaur outside the Vorarlberg state parliament. Sign on the right: ‘We had no choice…” XR Vorarlberg has been protesting the Tunnel Spider for months as part of a joint campaign with local NGOs, grassroots movements, and political parties. Since October 2022 there have been ten major actions, including occupying government buildings three times. And the rebels have won some precious victories. “We’re in an election year, and the current government has already decided to pass the final decision over the project on to the next legislative period. And the media now writes about a ‘controversial project’ when they mention the Tunnel Spider.” In January, XR Vorarlberg saw their local struggle turn international. 70 German activists from Last Generation and Ende Gelände (on their way to protest the World Economic Forum in Davos) joined a rebel street blockade outside a Tunnel Spider information centre. The activist alliance used tripods and pipe-locks, and climbed traffic lights and lampposts, to stretch a huge spider web across the street. Austrian rebels rallied again two weeks later outside the state parliament, and while there were no reinforcements from the global climate movement, there was a giant dinosaur. Police didn’t like the reminder that we are in the 6th mass extinction event, and shut the protest down, so rebels blockaded a nearby street, then joined a rally outside the state museum. All humans and dinosaurs managed to avoid arrest. Find out more about XR Austria’s campaigns on their website. 9 JAN | North Kivu, DRC: Members of XR Rutshuru march with communities living beside Virunga National Park to oppose proposed oil and gas exploitation there. They want the Congolese government to safeguard the park, protect the millions of people who depend on it, and cancel any active licences for oil exploration there. 11 JAN | Kampala, Uganda: Another activist with Students Against Eacop is violently arrested and detained by Ugandan police. The trial of seven activists being held in Luzira prison will start this month. The group refuse to be intimidated and vow to continue their peaceful campaign against the ecocidal oil pipeline. 12 JAN | Adelaide, Australia: XR South Australia targets a regional cycling race because it is sponsored by Santos, a fossil fuel company. Rebels were a loud and colourful presence at an opening ceremony and along the route around Adelaide. They called on the South Australian government to dump Santos as sponsor. 16–17 JAN | Sandefjord, Norway: 30 rebels blockade the entrances and driveway to the Oil and Energy Conference, where 62 new oil production licences were handed out. Police eventually cleared the blockades so the heavily delayed conference could begin. But the rebels returned with car horns, amps, vuvuzelas, cowbells, recorders, tin whistles, pots and pans, and disturbed the presentations within. They also gave the oil elite and their politician lapdogs an especially early wake-up call the next morning (the conference was in a hotel). XR Norway are demanding an end to new oil licences and a start to decommissioning the oil industry. They promise to keep disturbing the oil elite wherever they gather. 18 JAN | Paris, France: Victory! French rebel Coline (front, centre) finally returns home after a concerted campaign by friends, family, and rebels to get her freed. She was imprisoned in Senegal under conspiracy charges for going to a rally by a presidential candidate in November, and faced life imprisonment. The election is being continually delayed by the current president, who has already served a maximum two terms, but has the backing of the French government. 22 JAN | Toronto, Canada: A brand new Red Rebel brigade pays a visit to the headquarters of the Royal Bank of Canada, the biggest funder of fossil fuels in the world since the Paris Agreement. 24 JAN | Buenos Aires, Argentina: XR Argentina joins thousands of activists, unions, and citizens in a nationwide strike against the ecocidal and repressive laws being introduced by the new president of Argentina. If passed, his ‘omnibus law’ will see the country enter a dark era of banned protest and unregulated extractivism. 27 JAN | Farnborough, UK: Rebels, local residents, and climate queen Greta Thunberg protest against the expansion of Farnborough Airport, which would see private jet flights grow from 50,000 to 70,000 a year. Private jets are up to 30 times more polluting than passenger airliners, and service an unfathomably selfish elite. A week later, Greta walked free from a London court after being arrested for ‘public disorder’ during protests at an oil and gas conference in the city last year. 28 JAN | Copenhagen & Aalborg, Denmark: Rebels from XR Denmark and Scientist Rebellion blockade a main road leading into Kastrup Airport to demand a ban on private jets. Drivers got angry, shoving rebels aside and driving through their banners. A journalist covering the event was hit by a car and taken to hospital. Meanwhile, three scientists (pictured) blockaded a private jet at Aalborg Airport. Private jet use in Denmark quadrupled between 2020 and 2022. A four-hour private jet flight emits as much carbon per person as an average European does in a year. 28 JAN | Brussels, Belgium: XR Belgium launches a wave of actions against fossil fuel subsidies ahead of national and EU elections. 150 activists hosted a traffic-blocking street party and demanded a future free from fossil fuels. 70% of Belgians are in favour of stricter environmental safeguards, yet the politicians sit on their hands. 1 FEBRUARY | Virginia, USA: A ‘Mountain Mama’ with Appalachians Against Pipelines locks onto a helicopter used to transport workers to a remote site of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, delaying construction for many hours. She and another protester were arrested and jailed. 26 JAN | Washington, D.C., USA The science is clear. Scientist Rebellion joins protests outside the North American Gas Forum in Washington, D.C., in October 2023. The fossil fuel industry had big plans for America’s natural gas, which is fracked from the ground and liquified for easy export abroad. More than 20 new Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) export facilities were earmarked for construction along the Gulf of Mexico, despite having the same cumulative pollution as 675 coal-fired power plants. But those plans won’t be going forward - at least not for now. After decades of protest by frontline communities, especially in the Gulf Coast where most of these facilities would be constructed, a large coalition came together to take the fight to Washington, D.C. Three days of rallies and civil disobedience were planned outside the Department of Energy, with 1,000 people taking NVDA training and risking arrest. But days before the disruption was due to begin, the American President announced a pause on LNG export approvals, and the start of taking climate and environmental harm into consideration during any future decision-making. A huge coalition has campaigned against LNG in Washington D.C., including the Vessel Project (Photo: Jamie Henn), Climate Defiance, XR DC, and Third Act. The initial reaction was universal joy, with everyone from giant NGOs to frontline communities, youth movements, and elders celebrating the announcement. After years of dogged campaigning, petition delivering, and pressure on Congress for precisely this decision, here was a victory that felt well-earned. Climate Defiance, who have been hounding D.C.’s oil-friendly elite, called it “the most significant move any President has ever made on stopping fossil fuels.” But rebels from XR DC, whose campaign to Electrify DC is intricately linked with the push to stop LNG, sounded a note of caution, calling the win a “ray of hope” in a difficult fight with an industry that has its claws deeply embedded in the country. “There are still 8 LNG export facilities in operation and 10 more already approved, setting the U.S. on a path to double the volume of LNG exported by 2028.” The fight continues. On Feb 8th, Friends of the Earth Action activists disrupted a Big Oil funded senator who is opposed to the LNG pause. Over the past months, the climate justice movement has mobilised closely with the Palestinian Liberation movement, and there are concerns that the climbdown on LNG is a cynical way for the President to shore up his youth vote in an election year. There’s also the fact that America might not have enough gas to warrant the new terminals. Days before the LNG announcement, data from the Department of Energy revealed that the country’s gas supply was in terminal decline, with consultants telling the government to reevaluate supply before approving any more exports. Whether this dramatic policy shift was spurred more by dogged activism, desperate vote-seeking, or good old-fashioned resource depletion - it demonstrates weakness in one of the most powerful cogs of our global fossil-capital system. That weakness is worth celebrating, and worth pushing for further gains and new horizons. The cover of a graphic novel about degrowth and misunderstandings around it.

Article: What the Climate Movement’s Debate About Disruption Gets Wrong This essay argues that many climate activists are chasing the wrong metrics. Rather than aiming to win over a majority of the public, we should be focusing on repeatedly disrupting elite decision-makers - in a way that hurts their wallets. The overthrow of racial segregation by activists in 1960s America is used to prove the essay’s case. 26 FEB–3 MAR | Global The Insure Our Future network is gearing up for its first Global Week of Action. Activists around the world are going to target the insurance industry for their role in the climate crisis. Insurance is the Achilles heel of the fossil fuel industry.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/01/29/mothers-rebellion-kenya/,"In order to get to know my fellow Mothers in Mothers* Rebellion for Climate Justice I called up Betty Ngeno in Kenya for an interview. Betty is a 29-year-old mother of two, who lives in Nairobi, Kenya. I start by asking how she ended up in Nairobi, this throbbing, modern, vibrant and violent city which wants to be known as ""The Green City in the Sun"" but goes by the nickname Nairobbery. “When growing up in a rural area in Kenya, I saw a lot of challenges that women faced especially in accessing resources. In the community of Kenya, males are the head of household and they are the ones to give directions on what is to be done. Most landowners are men but the land is cultivated and taken care of by women. There are a lot of uncultivated lands and women don't have power to do that and that pushed me to study a course in gender and development studies to help rural women and empower them through education. I have a university degree in Gender and Development Studies.” In her work she focuses on education about adaptation of farming in a climate-changed world. She advocates for the rural women since they often are the key person to provide food and water for their children although the man is the head of family. “Personally I love farming a lot,” Betty continues, “and whenever I was home for holidays my dad could support me and I could do commercial farming for vegetables and it helped in paying school fees for my siblings. That's my motivation for working with rural women. With support from male counterparts, the issue of food shortages especially with the escalating climate crisis can be dealt with from a community level.” Every now and then the line breaks because the internet is both unstable and expensive, which still is the reality for many people in Kenya. “For how long have you been a Mothers* Rebellion activist?”, I ask when we’re online again. ”I have been an activist in Mothers* Rebellion for 8 months and I'm also active in the Global Wave of Climate Action. It’s a network for women in rural villages. In Kenya, as in many other countries in Africa, women are responsible for about 50% of the farming but the landowners are mostly men. Therefore, gender equality goes together with education about climate change and adaptation to new ways of farming. It’s important to lift women’s and girls’ voices but also to work with raising awareness in general about the fact that inequality doesn’t benefit anyone. Especially not the children.” I am curious about the awareness in general about the climate crisis in Kenya, and Betty explains: “A year ago, there was a bad drought in Kenya and Kenyans in general are quite aware of global warming and face new weather patterns on a local level, for instance it’s raining now in the beginning of November which normally is a dry month. Droughts and floods affect farming severely, and new ways of farming need to be taught.” Since we are part of the same movement and I have been drawn to Mothers* Rebellion and the global level of involvement due to my strong belief in climate justice I want to know why she ended up with Mothers* Rebellion and her opinion of the rapidly growing movement which started little more than a year ago in Sweden, Uganda, Germany and Zambia as a branch of Extinction Rebellion. “Mothers* Rebellion is a good movement although the word rebellion can be a bit offensive, and people wonder what you are rebelling against.” This makes me think. I haven’t reflected on how Mothers* Rebellion, as a name, can sound different in Kenya, and other parts of the world, to how it is perceived in the Global North. Rebel means something else in Kenya than in Sweden where I come from. Due to Kenya’s history and colonial heritage rebel is a much more offensive term. Sweden has no history of rebelling, rebel armies or being convicted for uprisings. The closest to rebellion against the state I know of is the Union and mass strikes in the 1930’s. Maybe the women’s suffrage as well, but they were never called rebels. It is legal, though, to organise and have a circle of women and allies in a public space in Kenya; it falls under the law ‘Freedom of Speech’. You only need to apply for permission from the police. To spread the word and organize, Mothers* Rebellion Nairobi uses WhatsApp and it’s a small group of friends who show up. In order to make Mothers* Rebellion grow as a movement, Betty would like to get some help to set up a Facebook page and an Instagram page. It would be helpful to get instructions and assistance from a media person in the Mothers* Rebellion global team. A homepage could also be a good start for collaboration. When I ask what she wants to add she says firmly: “Children are most vulnerable to global warming and all children should have equal rights to a liveable future.” Well that's where we meet, Betty and me. Climate justice is the umbrella term which can carry our message further. We do this for the children. All children.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2024/01/12/global-newsletter-84/,"Earth Uprising activists protest a new motorway in France. The French state tried and failed to outlaw the group last year - one of many protest victories in 2023. This issue: XR Argentina Uncertain Future | Green Rivers in Italy | 2023 Victories | Dear rebel, In 2023, we saw the world get battered by extreme weather, we saw global heating break all records, we saw an oil company host COP and hail vague promises as progress, we saw the West rollback on climate pledges while giving a nod to genocide in Palestine, and we saw billionaires build bunkers in preparation for societal collapse. As we gear up for another year of protest, we could probably all do with a bit more hope. Which is why you should keep reading. Because as well as covering December’s most inspiring rebel actions from around the world, this issue also remembers some key victories by rebels and their allies over the last year. Rebels perform a special dance during a campaign against extractivism in Argentina. In Action Highlights we report on a nationwide campaign against extractivism in Argentina, where courageous rebels are continuing to protest despite threats from an authoritarian new president. We also investigate a gross overreaction by the Italian state, with rebels being banished for years from Venice for (harmlessly) turning one of its rivers green. For a New Year boost, our Special Report picks out six victories from 2023 that prove peaceful protest works. Each entry is a precious jewel to savour, and should put a spring in your step as you march the streets this year. Climate Defiance ruins an honorary dinner for the CEO of ExxonMobil. In 2023, the new group terrified Washington and met with the White House. Victory! Finally, in Humans of XR, we speak to an inspiring rebel living in Sri Lanka who is both a climate and a human rights activist after witnessing terrible crimes during the mass protests of 2022 that swept away the government.

Donate What You Can 4 DEC | Nationwide, Argentina Rebels perform a group dance while marching through Buenos Aires. Since the large-scale Atlanticazo protests we covered a few months ago, the streets of Argentina haven’t gone quiet. December saw the launch of a huge campaign by more than 128 assemblies, organisations and indigenous communities to oppose extractivist governments all over the world. XR Argentina was a key part of the coalition, with 10 regional groups bringing banners, drums, and actions to marches across the country. In Buenos Aires, rebels performed an intricate group dance while tethered together by threads, mirroring the mycorrhizal networks that bind fungus to plants and nourish entire ecosystems. The campaign followed the election of a new Argentine president, who stood on a platform of populist and ultra-neoliberal policies. He quickly issued a decree that scraps or weakens over 350 laws, and XR Argentina released a detailed statement warning of the terrible ecological damage it will cause. A delegation from Jujuy join the march in Buenos Aires (left), a Mapuche woman talks about the suffering caused by extractivism in Patagonia (top right), and rebels protest beside the Argentine Sea, which is earmarked for offshore oil drilling. The decree will enable a surge in rural land sales to foreign companies, reduce oversight of mining companies, and weaken indigenous land rights. Worse, the new government has followed the decree with an authoritarian crackdown on free speech and protest. Activists face being stripped of state benefits and billed for police deployment. XR Argentina stresses that all these repressive changes are unconstitutional, and rebel groups are discussing how to navigate the new legal landscape and continue public protest. Right now, the future for rebels in Argentina is full of uncertainty. Follow XR Argentina on Instagram. 9 DEC | Rome Venice Milan Turin Bologna Bari, Italy Rivers turn green to denounce the failure of COP28. Banners: The government speaks, the earth sinks. In a disturbing trend that has become the new normal in Italy, peaceful eco-activists are being branded a “danger to security and public order”, banned from cities without trial, and criminalised under anti-terrorist laws intended to prosecute the mafia. Here’s what the Italian government considers so dangerous: In a coordinated day of action, rebels turned the rivers of six cities green with a harmless dye to denounce the inaction of COP28, and used climbing gear to suspend themselves from bridges to show how life is hanging by a thread. Papier-mâché houses were displayed sinking into the waters, while rebels played music, made speeches, distributed leaflets, and engaged with curious pedestrians. In Venice, 28 people were arrested, including a random tourist and members of the press. 27 charges and five city bans lasting 4-years were served, though the police were forced to revoke one expulsion order because it illegally banned a student from attending her university. A rebel plays her double bass under the Ponte di Rialto. She was arrested, and the instrument was confiscated by the police. The police overreaction caused a public outcry. Fifty teachers from Ca' Foscari University wrote an open letter calling the response an ""intimidating and unhealthy act for a democratic society"". In Torino, a petition signed by 2500 people, including many professors, asked the government ""to guarantee maximum freedom of demonstration and to avoid the criminalisation of dissent"". But the Venetian police refused to see sense. Two weeks later, everyone identified with the Grand Canal action was summoned for an ""oral warning”, a prelude to special state surveillance usually reserved for members of the mafia. And two more city bans were served days later, also based on illegitimate legal grounds. The Italian government is trying to construct a narrative that defines those who join climate movements as eco-terrorists and criminals. Italian rebels, meanwhile, will keep telling the truth.

Ecocidal corporations like Rio Tinto want to dig up Serbia’s rich mineral deposits, and the politicians are happy to oblige. Weeks later, rebels joined a series of huge blockades in the capital after the government was accused of stealing a December election. Police used tear gas and violence to clear the protests. 2 DECEMBER | Barcelona, Spain: Rebels occupy the Barcelona European Parliament office to denounce COP and demand a European Citizens' Assembly. They sprayed the building with black paint, dropped a banner, and chained themselves to the balcony, while others blocked the road outside. 8 DEC | Rotterdam, Netherlands: 130 rebels block the main access roads to the Europoort, the most polluting port in Europe. After hours of disruption, the Mayor of Rotterdam invited XR for talks about making the port more sustainable. During the meeting, the Mayor acknowledged the port had a major pollution problem and a green transition was necessary, but promised only to discuss the matter further with the company running the port. 5–10 DEC | Melbourne, Australia: The December Rebellion disrupts city traffic for four days, culminating in a massive slow march and sit-down that saw 75 arrests. Indigenous groups, Red Rebels, and Blinky the giant burning koala, joined hundreds on the streets to resist seismic blasting, fossil fuels, and the global war machine. Photo: Ari Hatzis 9 DEC | Global: Rebels join hundreds of protests across 40 countries, including the UK (top) and COP28 host, UAE (bottom) to mark a Global Day of Action for Climate Justice and demand a ceasefire in Gaza, highlighting how the climate crisis and genocidal violence are both results of the same unjust global systems. 12 DEC | Oslo, Norway: Rebels shut down the headquarters of Norway’s largest trade union group for its support of the oil industry and failure to offer its workers jobs in a green transition. The blockade forced arriving union employees to face people “drowning” in oil and either support or reject further oil exploration. The government recently banned deforestation, though is still happy for its oil industry to commit ecocide beyond its own boundaries. 15 DEC | Kampala, Uganda: Four more student activists are violently arrested during a protest outside the Ugandan parliament. As well as demanding an end to EACOP, they demanded the release of seven student activists imprisoned earlier in November. The seven students were released a few days later and accused the prison of torture. The four newly incarcerated students will not be up for release until the 10th January. 16 DEC | Liège & Antwerp, Belgium: Code Rouge/Rood activists from across Europe disrupted Liège Airport and Antwerp Airport to demand degrowth of the aviation industry and an end to private jets. Police used batons and pepper spray to violently arrest hundreds of protesters as they headed to Antwerp Airport, though some still managed to access the runway and block all private jet traffic. But the police weren’t ready for a second target! 600 activists entered Liège Airport, Europe’s fastest growing cargo airport and the main EU hub for e-commerce giant, Alibaba. 17–18 DEC | Cape Town, South Africa: Rebel paddlers take to the sea to resist the arrival of a seismic blasting ship from Australia. The ship will blast continuous sound pulses for four months to find fossil fuels under the seabed, killing marine life as it does so. The paddle protest followed a beach rally earlier in the month. 18 DEC | Seattle, USA: XR Seattle blockades an Amazon warehouse to protest the colossal damage the corporation is doing to ecosystems and communities around the world. Rebels demanded accountability and drastic reform as five protesters locked on beside a crowd of supporters. The action was originally meant to happen on Black Friday, but was postponed when details were leaked to the police. Victories in 2023 in (top) the Netherlands, Panama, France (bottom) DRC, UK, USA. As we gear up for another year of protest, we could probably all do with a bit more hope. So here are six victories from 2023 that prove peaceful protest is the answer, and can keep us buzzing on the streets... Paul Hawken's idea is simple: anything that supports living systems in accumulating carbon is likely to address climate change AND carry other great benefits, from biodiversity enhancement to economic prosperity. This book is an accessible but thorough exploration of what kinds of projects provide that support and why. Anyone engaged in resource management, community organisation, or infrastructure design can use Hawken's book to figure out how to be part of the solution. Remember that “resource management” can include your own garden. Paul Hawken does not try to claim that any small effort can save the whole world, but his advice does apply to both large and small scales—and he provides plenty of examples of seemingly powerless people who found ways to make a surprisingly big difference. Regeneration is a book of principles, not procedures—a valid and useful approach to advice-giving, but it could surprise readers, and some might also wish the book had a reference section. But in a world where most authors seem focused on climate solutions that are either too big for most people to implement or too small to really matter, Paul Hawken threads the needle and offers some truly useful advice.

Photo: Tharaka Basnayaka @tharaka_ Ten years ago, I started working at a farmer’s market in Colombo, which was also a social enterprise that prioritises people and planet over profit. I had always been concerned about the climate crisis, and working there inspired me to turn this concern into action. The first protest I organised was in 2019 as part of global climate strike by Fridays for Future. My friends and I made posters, went to a local park, and asked people to join us. Then I joined XR Sri Lanka. Initially, we organised actions such as tree planting and trash audits because disruptive protesting in Sri Lanka was very unsafe. In 2022, mass protests against the government broke out across the country, which became known as Aragalaya (The Struggle). I joined with a few friends in a tent, and after nearly four months of protesting, the presidential and prime ministerial residences were occupied by the people. During these protests, something happened which drew me to human rights activism, as well as climate activism. While we had been targeted with tear gas and water cannons by the police before, and even got arrested, I had never felt thoroughly unsafe. But on coming home after spending days at the protest site, we heard that the military had surrounded it. Our friends were still there, and we quickly returned, only to be met by a wall of soldiers. A member of the military grabbed my phone and started to delete footage I had taken of the protests. When my friend stood up for me, they grabbed him, hit him in his face and dragged him off. It was terrifying; we didn’t know where he was for over three hours. He was beaten by the police for the entirety of this time. To this day, he does not dare to file a complaint with the Human Rights Commission because the military threatened to come for his family. Since then, I have been involved in several causes, and I raise awareness about the intersection between climate change and human rights violations. I now understand that lack of accountability for human rights violations also leads to no accountability for environmental and economic crimes. There is this narrative pushed by governments and the private sector that tackling climate change is a privileged endeavour, and that living standards have to go down for emissions to go down. In Sri Lanka, we have seen time and time again that this is not true, and that it takes tremendous risk and courage to speak out for the truth.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/12/12/global-newsletter-83/,"The COP28 President attends a meeting in Dubai on the day the people of Panama celebrate their Supreme Court closing an ecocidal copper mine. This issue: Panama vs Copper Mine | UAE’s Land Grab in Africa | XR Bolivia Dear rebel, If a rehab centre was letting in drug dealers, you’d question its commitment. If that rehab centre was being run by a drug cartel, you’d give up all hope entirely. It sounds ludicrous, but that is the relationship between the world’s premier climate summit and the fossil fuel industry. A record 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists were let into COP28 in the United Arab Emirates, and the man in charge of the conference is the CEO of the host nation’s oil company. The UN conference where the world should be uniting to end the fossil fuel industry has instead become a space for oil companies to do secret business deals and deny the scientific reality that fossil fuel use must end. Panamanians rally outside their Supreme Court as it decides whether to close a copper mine so unpopular it caused hundreds of thousands to take to the streets. In a Special Report, we expose the truth behind the UAE’s roadmap to ‘solving’ the climate crisis without dismantling its oil industry, showing how its purchase of a vast region of Kenyan forest for a carbon credit scheme is resulting in the brutal mass evictions of the indigenous people living there. In better news, Action Highlights focuses on a wave of protest in South America that is building in Bolivia and led to a historic victory for the people of Panama, where the Supreme Court has ruled that a giant ecocidal copper mine must close. The victory in Panama came at great human cost - activists were shot by motorists and blinded by police. But it is proof that peaceful protest can overcome corporate interests and reshape our politics in a way that climate summits currently cannot. A man draws water to sell from Lake Kivu in Goma, DRC, both a source of drinking water and an unstable store of greenhouse gases. This image by @bienfaitcn was 1st place in the XR Global Photography Contest - see more in Announcements. That doesn’t mean we can ignore COP, even as preparations are underway for another petrostate, Azerbaijan, to host the summit next year. The planet is heating too quickly to completely abandon our best chance of a unified global response. Instead, we must call out world leaders who try to legitimise the car crash that was COP28, and demand fundamental reform to how the summit is run. It’s time for the UN to shut the door to fossil fuel lobbyists, and limit the voting and hosting rights of oil states once and for all. Drug dealers and drug cartels be damned.

Donate What You Can 28 NOVEMBER | Panama City, Panama Victory! The people of Panama have won an almighty battle against the mining industry. After weeks of nationwide protests against a huge ecocidal copper mine, Panama’s Supreme Court has ruled the mine must shut down, and its Congress has issued a moratorium on all new mining. The protests drew in hundreds of thousands of Panamanians, angered by years of corruption between the government and the mining sector. The Canadian owned copper mine was operating with no state oversight, and the pollution was so out of control that indigenous communities were drinking toxic groundwater while mine employees had bottled water flown in. Protesters march through the streets of La Chorrera city in central Panama. The campaign included motorway blockades, a shutdown of the copper mine’s port using small boats, and culminated in a march through Panama City attended by 250,000 people. But it was all sparked by smaller protests last year, organised by environmental organisations like Ya es Ya! (the Panamanian chapter of Scientist Rebellion) and Panamá sin Minería as well as workers’ unions. The protests pulsed with a special cultural character that meant dancing and music were just as important as marching and blockades. But they were also sites of great tragedy. While the protesters remained peaceful, police and some motorists reacted with appalling violence. Police used extreme violence and expired tear gas to try to end the protests. Five protesters were killed, two shot to death by an American whose car was blocked on the Pan-American Highway. Several protesters were also partially or wholly blinded by police, among them a photojournalist and two children. The people of Panama have overcome shocking acts of violence to claim an astonishing win, and have vowed to continue their campaign by targeting other ecocidal mines. Their bravery and persistence should inspire us all. Follow Ya es Ya! on Instagram and Twitter. NOVEMBER | La Paz, Bolivia November has been an active month for XR Bolivia, who have been co-organising large weekly actions in the capital against widespread ecological and social injustices blighting the country. Vast forest fires exacerbated by a severe drought have consumed around 3 million hectares of Bolivian forest, destroying dozens of indigenous communities and countless ecosystems, and closing schools nationwide due to the smoke. Yet the government has done nothing to stop the slash-and-burn farming methods igniting them, and is also facing protests by mining unions who want to extract gold from protected natural reserves. XR Warmis highlight the cost of the climate crisis to women. Banner: Not earth nor women are territory for conquests. Depatriarchise environmentalism. Ecologise feminism. In the first week of November, rebel activists marched to the Vice-Presidency building in the city centre to call on the government to repeal the ‘incendiary laws’ that relaxed restrictions on forest clearing, and to resist the demands of the miners. Later in the month, more than 100 protesters gathered in front of the Ministry of Fire Defence to demand the government declare a national disaster and provide more resources for volunteer firefighters. On the final weekend of the month, XR Warmis (XR Women) rallied through the streets of the capital to highlight how women are more vulnerable to the climate crisis, with gender-based violence, harassment, and trafficking all more likely in the aftermath of extreme weather disasters. Rebels rally through La Paz against forest fires and mining concessions. Banner: Our mother earth won’t be negotiated or sold, it will be defended! XR Bolivia was started two years ago by people in La Paz hungry for a new way to do activism. “We wanted to change the perspective on activism here in Bolivia, because it was mostly done by NGOs or in a very passive way,” says a co-founder. “We quickly gained attention nationwide and were joined by a lot of people who have been activists for a long time and were also looking for this radical change.” Most of its members are involved with sister groups like XR Warmis, Scientist Rebellion and Debt For Climate, and XR Bolivia also works in alliance with various regional ecoactivist, ecofeminist and indigenous groups. “We work from a decolonised perspective”, says the co-founder. “Part of that is the direct work we do with indigenous people, who are most affected by environmental destruction. We don’t want to be their voice, but a channel for their voices to be heard.” Follow XR Bolivia on Instagram and TikTok.

What else can we conclude when corporations and nation states can claim to offset their pollution by ""protecting"" forests, and in the process evict indigenous communities? The UAE’s hunger for carbon credits is causing the violent eviction of hundreds of thousands of indigenous people in Kenya. With the support of a US consultancy firm, UAE carbon trading companies pledged to invest $450 million in credits at the recent African Climate Summit in Nairobi. A stipulation of their agreement with the Kenyan government was to reduce emissions from any forests protected by the scheme, and the Kenyan president then ordered the eviction of all people living in them. The destruction of homes by forest rangers has already started in the Mau Forest, despite court orders ruling that the indigenous Ogiek people living there have community rights over their land and cannot be evicted. Villages burn on Ogiek land ‘protected’ by UAE carbon credits. Photo: OPDP Carbon land grabs are not new, but the size, scope, and speed of the UAE’s recent land grabs are unprecedented. Blue Carbon, run by a member of the Emirati royal family, has signed deals for 24.5 million hectares in five African countries. The goal is to generate vast numbers of cheap carbon credits that can be bought by the UAE to “offset” their ballooning fossil fuel emissions planned over the coming decades. In the process, the company aims to steer negotiations at COP28 towards developing “suitable market infrastructure” so the UAE and other oil states can use offsetting to sustain business as usual for as long as possible. At COP28, the rules of how to buy and sell these carbon credits are being decided. We face a pivotal moment where carbon land grabs could sweep the Global South. If the UAE succeeds, money meant for environmental protection could instead fund mass displacement, and the erasure of indigenous people. Carbon credits are merely reputation in money form. Their price and popularity has crashed before, in part thanks to activist and investigative outcry, and they can be crashed again. Rebels in Kenya and communities around the world are resisting this massive fraud and speaking out in solidarity with the Ogiek people. The Blood Carbon Scam can be stopped – but only if we spread the truth. Sign this petition to stop the eviction of the Ogiek community in Kenya. 2 NOVEMBER | Rempang Island, Indonesia: Thousands of indigenous people are facing forced relocation to make way for a state-backed ‘Eco City’ centred around industry, trade, and tourism. 16 ancient villages will be cleared. XR Makassar is organising a social media solidarity campaign to pressure the government to change course. 7 NOV | Belgrade, Serbia: Rebels join other ecoactivists to storm a conference on ‘sustainable mining’, where the government plans to sell access to Serbia’s rich mineral deposits. XR Serbia had asked to be part of a panel discussion about mineral extraction, but were turned down. They showed up anyway, and called for a new economy and a new society focused on the needs of all living beings, not just a handful of ultra-wealthy shareholders and politicians. 15 NOV | UK: XR UK launch ‘Don’t Pay For Dirty Water’, a campaign calling for a boycott of the wastewater charge in water bills. Water privatisation in the UK has led to billions in profits for shareholders, but rivers polluted with sewage for everyone else. Raw sewage is being dumped thousands of times a day by water companies looking to maximise profits. 17 NOV | Johannesburg, South Africa: XR Vaal and XR Gauteng join other groups to disrupt Sasol’s Annual General Meeting. 15 activists stormed the stage and read testimonies from communities across South Africa who have been ruined by the energy, chemical, and mining giant’s pollution. Sasol’s executives offered the activists a 20-minute meeting behind closed doors. When the activists insisted it take place publicly, the executives chose to cancel the AGM. 17–19 NOV | Global: Mothers Rebellion organise a 3rd global wave of action, with circles of mothers and allies forming in over 30 countries across 6 continents to highlight the urgent risks that children are facing due to runaway global heating. Photos (clockwise from top left): Kampala Uganda, Delhi India, Madrid Spain, Helsinki Finland. 21 NOV | Seoul, South Korea: XR Korea joins other activist groups to condemn Israel's invasion of Gaza and the many thousands of innocent civilians that have been killed. Shoes were laid out in a public square to commemorate the victims. 24 NOV | Kampala, Uganda: Student activists march to parliament to deliver a petition against EACOP. 7 were arrested, beaten in police cells, and after four days, remanded to prison, where they still remain. At COP28, the Total CEO backing EACOP was confronted about the arrests and promised to call for their release. 24–27 NOV | Newcastle, Australia: 3000 activists, including rebels, take part in a four-day blockade of the world’s largest coal port. The People’s Blockade, organised by Rising Tide, was the largest peaceful civil disobedience protest for climate action in Australia’s history. 109 people were arrested for demanding an end to new coal projects - the youngest was aged 15 and the oldest 97. 25 NOV | Gävle, Sweden: Rebels team up with Forest Rebellion and other groups to blockade a pulp mill run by Stora Enso. The Swedish-Finnish forest giant owns pulp mills and eucalyptus monocultures in Brazil and Uruguay that are linked to ecocide, indigenous dispossession, and money laundering. Find out more about Stora Enso’s litany of crimes and why it is uniting activists across Sweden, Finland, and Latin America. 28 NOV | Torino, Italy: Rebels disrupt a major international military and aerospace convention. 3 activists harnessed themselves to a walkway overlooking its entrance and dropped banners. The war industry destroys life and is responsible for 5% of global emissions. Despite this, military spending is ballooning across Europe.

Documentary: Breathless (28 mins) The BBC investigates the devastating health impact of gas-flaring on communities living near oil fields. Among the case studies is the UAE, where gas-flaring by state oil company Adnoc is causing asthma, lung disease, and cancer, but no one speaks out for fear of being imprisoned. Video: BBC Interviews Roger Hallam (51 mins) The XR co-founder tries and fails to make a complacent BBC journalist emotionally engage with the climate crisis in this fascinating debate. The link takes you to Hallam’s blog where you can also find his verdict on COP28 - run by fascists, legitimised by liberals, and facilitating the greatest holocaust in human history. A tough verdict, but on current evidence difficult to argue with. Article: Can XR’s Surprise Success in the Netherlands Be Replicated? An investigation into how XR Netherlands’ sustained blockade of the A12 motorway led to a political breakthrough over fossil fuel subsidies, how that victory has inspired new rebel blockades across Europe, and whether such success can be replicated. Report: Climate Equality - A Planet for the 99% The richest 1% of humanity produces more carbon emissions than the poorest two thirds combined, and will cause the heat-related deaths of 1.3 million people over the coming decades. That is the devastating finding of this report by Oxfam, which goes on to call for hefty taxes on the super-rich and fossil fuel companies. Article: How Colonial Rule Radically Shifts Responsibility for Climate Change Carbon Brief calculates the historical carbon emissions of countries, but makes colonial powers accountable for the emissions of colonised countries while they controlled them. These more just figures still result in the US and China topping the list, but the old European colonial powers see their share of emissions rocket, while former colonies see their shares drop. For example, the UK’s total emissions nearly double, while India’s fall by 15%, placing it below the UK in the table.

This image by @gastonbejas came 3rd in the XR Global Photography Contest. The first XR Global Photography Contest has closed, and these three photographs were chosen via public vote from a shortlist of 12 picked by a panel of judges. The images, themed around water, will be part of a travelling exhibition and an online exhibition, and the 12 shortlisted images will feature in a special calendar. The Judges Panel found choosing the shortlist a challenging task. The photographs were not only visually stunning but also powerful communicators of environmental issues, amplifying the voices of people too often ignored. They appreciate the commitment of all entrants to using photography to drive positive change, and look forward to continued collaboration. 29 NOV | London, UK: A Just Stop Oil activist is arrested for singing her protest song “We Tried” outside one of the many homes of the British Prime Minister.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/11/10/global-newsletter-82/,"Appalachians Against Pipelines (AAP) occupy the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which when completed will pipe gas to a BAE systems factory supplying weapons to Israel. This issue: Oily Money Out! | Atlanticazo Argentina | A69 Blockade | Palestine Dear rebel, Five years ago, more than 1000 people gathered outside the British Parliament in London for a declaration of rebellion. It was Extinction Rebellion’s first-ever public action, and the declaration finished with the line: “We act in peace, with ferocious love of these lands in our hearts. We act on behalf of life.” A rejection of violence and a love for all life have been integral to our movement since its inception. That is why we cannot be bystanders to the mass slaughter of innocent people living in Gaza, a slaughter now so sustained and indiscriminate that top UN officials are calling it a text-book case of genocide. The Israeli government says it is acting in self-defence after Hamas militants committed their own mass slaughter of innocents. But a massacre of civilians cannot justify an even greater massacre of civilians. And such a response will only fuel further extremism and conflict. Rebels gather for the first-ever XR action in London, on 31st October 2018. Instead, it resembles the brutal mindset of the old colonial powers. They also subjected their rebellious indigenous subjects to dehumanisation, dispossession, and destruction, as they rapidly extracted resources from their lands and seeded the climate catastrophe that we are now desperately trying to avert. Today those old colonial powers, so instrumental in creating and sustaining this long and bloody conflict in the Middle East, have chosen to endorse the slaughter, even exacerbate it, while criminalising those who peacefully protest against it. It is for all these reasons and more that our movement must unite in calling for a ceasefire, and pressure our governments to seek a diplomatic solution that ensures peace, dignity, and justice for everyone living on these lands, irrespective of race or religion. A protester is arrested after briefly managing to enter the ‘Oscars of Oil’ in London. The history of Palestine and Israel and the links between this conflict and climate justice are explored further in this month’s Must Reads. We also speak to a rebel with Palestinian roots in Humans of XR. In Action Highlights we report on the blockade of the ‘Oscars of Oil’ in London, how French police used so much pepper spray during a motorway protest that they set fire to a field, and a wave of action against seismic exploration off the Argentine coast. Finally, in Solidarity Corner we feature Defend Our Juries, a group resisting outrageous new restrictions being placed on the trials of ecoactivists by British judges, including the banning of any mention of ‘climate change’ in court, so that juries will find them guilty.

Donate What You Can 17 - 19 OCTOBER | London, UK An alliance of protesters including rebels rally outside the ‘Oscars of Oil’. The activists arrived early in the morning in small groups. As they approached the towering hotel, a beacon of luxury just a short walk from Buckingham Palace, some were wondering if their plan was too ambitious. But they set to work regardless, blockading each one of the hotel’s entrances. This was the venue for Energy Intelligence Forum, formerly known as the Oil & Money Conference, and casually known as the Oscars of Oil: a three-day summit for the CEOs of Big Oil firms to schmooze with politicians and dish out awards. Frustrated delegates circled the building, looking for a way in, angered by the chants of the tight-knit blockaders. There were around 400 protesters in all, from an alliance of groups brought together by Fossil Free London. They had come from across the UK, across Europe, and even from as far afield as Uganda and Mexico. A Ugandan activist with Stop EACOP speaks outside Standard Bank. In the end, the delegates gave up, with the CEO of Shell having to give his introductory speech over Zoom. After a series of threats, police finally arrested 27 protesters, including a certain Swedish icon. All but one were charged. Around 70 returned the next day for a noisy protest timed to interrupt a speech from the CEO of Equinor, the Norwegian firm set to drill the UK’s newly approved Rosebank oilfield. The police set up barriers to ensure access, but that forced the delegates to walk alongside the penned-back protesters who gave them a long, loud welcome, later enhanced by a group of XR drummers. The rest joined Money Rebellion, Coal Action Network, and a samba band for a tour of London’s financial district, beginning with a rally outside Standard Bank because of its funding of EACOP, an ecocidal oil pipeline that will straddle East Africa. The tour ended with the occupation of three buildings housing a total of ten insurance companies. Rebels occupy a skyscraper housing 8 insurance companies linked to fossil fuels. Rebels chanted and waved banners in the foyers, demanding that the companies rule out insuring both EACOP and the recently approved West Cumbria coal mine. One rebel group even had a picnic. Police did not interfere, and after five hours the protesters ended their occupations. The final day of the conference saw sixty health professionals join the action, staging a ‘die-in’ and a ‘climate inquest’ in the road outside the hotel and condemning the delegates inside for their complicity in a humanitarian disaster. Fossil Free London, meanwhile, marched to the headquarters of Barclays and J.P. Morgan, banks known for their grotesque and colossal financing of fossil fuels around the world. The campaign showed how the climate crisis is being exacerbated by a network of banks, insurers, and Big Oil firms, and also fostered a heartening sense of togetherness among multiple eco-groups. The trials of those arrested will begin next week. Follow Fossil Free London on Instagram. 4 OCT | Argentina Rebels perform ‘oil tanker’ sounds outside the municipal office of Mar Del Plata. Imagine being a sea cucumber or a coral or any other species of marine fauna. Whether you’re swimming around, clinging to a rock, or dragging yourself along the ocean floor, the last thing you want is a compressed-air bomb going off every six seconds. That's what happens with seismic exploration. The explosions are used to map rock formations under the ocean floor to find the best spots for oil drilling. A ship recently left Ghana for the coast of Argentina to start seismically exploring the South Atlantic Ocean for an unholy trinity of oil companies: Equinor, Shell, and YPF, which is semi-owned by the Argentine state. A deep-water exploratory oil well will also be drilled in January. It has triggered another “Atlanticazo”, a wave of protest by an alliance of activists against the exploitation of the ocean by oil companies. Actions have included disrupting YPF offices, invading a fossil fuel conference, and a special performance outside a municipal building using handmade hose instruments to replicate the sounds of oil tankers. International solidarity was shown by rebels in Ecuador, Mexico, Norway and the Netherlands, among others. An Atlanticazo rally in Misiones, Argentina (top left) plus solidarity actions in (clockwise) Ecuador, Colombia, and the Netherlands. The Argentine government first tried to approve offshore oil exploration back in December 2021, but sparked the largest protests that the coastal city of Mar del Plata had ever seen. The movement spread along the coast and across the world, dubbed Atlanticazo in tribute to the “Chubutazo”, an epic campaign where the people of Chubut province successfully resisted a mega-mining project. The government argues that offshore oil platforms will bring in much-needed foreign currency to pay off the country's huge international debts, but protesters argue that corporate extractivism is what impoverished the country in the first place and will only make matters worse. 21 - 22 OCT | Toulouse, France A protester kneels before riot police in surrender during a motorway protest. More than 10,000 people from across France have protested against an unnecessary and environmentally destructive new motorway. Preparatory work is already underway on the A69, which aims to connect Toulouse with the quiet town of Castres 70 km away – despite a national route already linking the two locations. A group named ‘La voie est libre’ (‘The way is clear’), formed in 2022 to try to stop the construction and save an estimated 200 trees (some hundreds of years old), wildlife reserves, houses that had sheltered families for generations, and at least 500 football pitches worth of land, much of it fertile enough to grow food. XR Toulouse joined up with ‘La voie est libre’ a year ago, to share civil disobedience tactics and support their struggle. After staging multiple smaller actions, they jointly organised an 8,000-strong protest against the A69 in April. This latest resistance, after three months of planning, saw an even bigger turnout. Thousands join the anti-A69 march through the rural southwest of France. Thousands of people, young and old, urban and rural, came together to march, cycle, and drive tractors along the existing route, passing open farmland and quiet villages before congregating in a field where organisers provided food, marquees, kids’ entertainment, and more. Some protestors built a barricade across the marching route. The next day, a group of activists tried to set up a ZAD (Zone to Defend) in an empty house on one of the construction sites, but were forced out by riot police swinging batons and firing tear gas. The violence spilled into a neighbouring field where protestors, some with children, were camping (with permission) and looking forward to a talk by renown climate scientists. The police let off so much tear gas that the field, parched after Europe’s heatwave summer, caught fire. Police charge protestors and release copious amounts of tear gas. The A69 was first proposed thirty years ago by a pharmaceutical and cosmetics company, and their tireless lobbying finally persuaded the French government to go ahead with the project in 2006. It is set to cost 20 euros for drivers to access the road, making it unaffordable for the majority of locals who are on low-incomes. At least nine people were arrested and are awaiting trial, and many were injured by police. Meanwhile, the French Interior Minister is seeking evermore repressive laws against climate activists and protests in general, as seen in his recent effort to ban all pro-Palestinian protests across the country. The alliance of activists involved in the blockade are taking time to recover and plan next steps. There is a vision to turn the A69 into a cycle highway, with regenerative projects along the route, like a centre for teaching people about eco-building. Despite intensifying state and police violence, these citizens are determined not to give up.

Three weeks later, two peaceful Stop EACOP protesters were arrested and imprisoned overnight. A UN official has said the repression of peaceful protest in Uganda is “very disturbing”. 11 OCT | Isangi, DRC: Another new rebel group is born thanks to the ‘Petrole Non Merci’ campaign of XR Goma University. The city of Isangi is located in a region renowned for its abundant peat bogs, land which has been earmarked for oil development by the Congolese government. Local people have formed XR Isangi to protect their land from extraction and destruction by international oil companies. 12 OCT | Worldwide: Thousands of people around the world, including rebels and Debt 4 Climate activists, rise up to demand the cancellation of the debt crippling the Global South. The global day of action, which coincided with a meeting between the World Bank and IMF in Marrakech, Morocco, saw mobilisations across Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. There was also a counter-summit in Marrakech, attended by a coalition of activists. Global South debts are tiny compared to the estimated $7.9 trillion in climate reparations owed to the region by the Global North. Photos (Clockwise from top left): Panama, Bangladesh, Morocco, Tanzania. 9 - 15 OCT | Helsinki, Finland: XR Elokapina launch their forest rebellion, a week of slow marches to highlight the exploitative and ecocidal environmental policies of their government. A key demand was to stop the felling of a 400-year-old forest neighbouring the capital. 16 OCT | Appalachia, USA: Dozens of activists with AAP, including indigenous Americans, occupy two construction sites of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP). Banners and armlocks highlighted the connection between the pipeline and the genocide in Gaza. MVP will pipe gas to a BAE Systems factory that supplies white phosphorus and other weapons to Israel. Construction was paused for the day, and five arrested activists spent the night in jail. 17 OCT | Cape Town, South Africa: Rebels are joined by bus-loads of pro-oil/gas protestors on the opening day of African Energy Week, a conference focused on fossil fuel expansion and greenwashing rather than clean, cheap renewables. It turned out the pro-oil/gas protestors had been paid to turn up, and when they heard about the true impact of fossil fuels, many apologised for being on “the wrong side” and asked to join the rebel protest. 23 OCT | The Hague, Netherlands: Rebels from the action group ‘Justice Now!’ rally outside the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and in condemnation of the war crimes by the Israeli state. 23 OCT | Rome, Italy: 100 rebels dressed as Pinocchio block the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. Some chained themselves to the entrance, some locked on to each other, others scaled poles in front of the building - all to denounce the climate denialism of their government. 40 rebels were dragged to a nearby police station and held for over eight hours. 5 were expelled from Rome for up to two years. 25 - 26 OCT | Washington DC, USA: Rebels and ecoactivists from across the US rally outside a luxury hotel to confront industry executives and government officials attending the North American Gas Forum. They blocked the car of a top official trying to leave the conference, were cleared by police, then re-blocked it as it reached a nearby street. The next day, rebels shut down the construction of a $4.5 billion gas pipeline in the capital. 26 OCT | La Paz & Santa Cruz, Bolivia: Rebels rally outside government ministries demanding action on the wave of forest fires sweeping the country. They want sanctions against those responsible, law changes, and an emergency to be declared. XR Bolivia promises more actions if these demands are not met. 28 OCT | Berlin, Germany: Although XR Germany cancelled the action days earlier due to the “tense global political situation”, a thousand protesters, including rebels, activists with Scientist Rebellion and Last Generation, as well as a delegation from XR Netherlands, still blockaded a major street to stop fossil fuel subsidies. The action was inspired by the success of the similar campaign in the Netherlands. Some activists glued themselves to the tarmac. Police used pain holds as they dragged them away. 28 OCT | Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Australia: Rebels and activists with Disrupt Burrup Hub rally outside multiple ABC studios after the broadcaster agreed to pass confidential footage of ecoactivists onto the police. An ABC crew were embedded with Disrupt Burrup Hub as they planned a protest against an enormous gas project on sacred Aboriginal land. The move was called ‘a chilling breach of trust’. My name is Shireen. I’m of Palestinian/Lebanese/Syrian heritage, was born and raised in the United States, and now live in London. I’ve been an activist my whole life – from a young age I’ve always known that you have to speak out against oppression, because the stakes are too high not to. Growing up in diaspora, I quickly understood our loss of home and country. It was talked about constantly. We protested, gave money to charities, and boycotted. I saw my parents and family standing up, so I stood up. I was also impacted by the Quaker influences in my life, from my mother’s side of the family and from my schooling. Growing up as a young Arab American in the 80s and 90s, the media was so unrelentingly biased and inaccurate about anything related to Palestinians that it felt like you were constantly under attack. Society, at that time, was often ignorant and racist against Arabs. It felt suffocating if I didn’t speak out. I found outlets in protesting, literally feeling myself being present to say “I don’t support this,” and being able to assert our history in an environment that wilfully excluded it. I wrote papers in school and college about Palestinian reality under Israeli occupation, and became active with Students for a Free Palestine (a predecessor to SJP). We held talks, die-ins, replicated checkpoints – we worked hard to insert Palestinian perspectives into what was a very hostile environment. After college, I moved into working in public health, focusing on human rights for marginalised communities in the SWANA region, including Palestinians. I always knew that the planet was in trouble, but I never really saw the connection until my husband pushed me to get my head out of the sand. I did, and I panicked. Then I got involved. As with my activism around Palestine, being active against the Climate & Ecological Emergency (CEE) helps my mental health. I couldn’t be on the sidelines just letting harm happen, not doing anything. As I learned more about the climate crisis, I learned that it is also an issue of justice with links to colonialism. These aren’t the headlines when it comes to the CEE, but they are the bones of this calamity. It’s taken a lot of time and learning for me to make these connections, but there is no future without climate justice through an anti-colonial lens. Right now, I’m trying to manage my visceral response to the Israeli state’s genocidal attacks on Palestinians in Gaza. It’s been paralysing and galvanising at the same time. Most of my energy is going towards platforming voices from Gaza and helping friends gain a broader perspective of what’s happening. And of course, attending marches. In spare snatches of mental space, I am very involved in the XR Global blog. We publish articles to help share XR’s view on climate related topics, always trying to platform voices from the Global South. I’m also active with XR Wordsmiths, where we just finished a beautiful Solarpunk writing project, and am part of XR Lewisham. I am motivated by visions of a better world for my children and every child on Earth. We owe it to them. We stand on the shoulders of giants, from Harriet Tubman to Edward Said, and must keep their legacy of astounding courage and moral clarity alive. Empires fall, the world is constantly changing, and that also motivates me. What I love about activism is the connection to other people and being surrounded by love. Activism comes from a place of love, and you feel that. I love seeing people change, on a personal level – whether it’s their actions or political outlook, seeing the impact you can have is heartening. The challenge is that change doesn’t happen quickly enough and there are so many battles to fight, it can feel exhausting and overwhelming. Balancing activism and being present for my family in the way that I want to be can be difficult. There is a concept that is central to the Palestinian struggle: ‘sumoud’, steadfastness. I look at our history of resistance, and am so inspired by this indefatigable fight that Palestinians have in them. We have been occupied, dispossessed, walled in, deported, starved, made homeless, blamed, tortured, expelled, blockaded, maligned, imprisoned, bombed, are currently being killed with genocidal intent, and still Palestinians respond, “We will not leave our land”. That kind of courage is a call to action for everyone. The stakes are too high to not do anything, about Palestine and about preserving our planet. If there was one message I’d like to share with the global XR community, it is: ‘sumoud’ – keep going. If you know (or are) a rebel somewhere in the world with a story to tell, get in touch at xr-newsletter@protonmail.com XR Peace prepare banners for the Big One in London, UK in April this year. This month, Must Reads is dedicated to the conflict between Palestine and Israel: its history, its present reality, and how it relates to our own struggle for climate justice and the preservation of all life. Article: What’s the Israel-Palestine conflict about? This simple guide by Al Jazeera explains one of the world’s longest-running conflicts, unpacking key moments like the Balfour Declaration, the Arab revolt, the UN partition plan, the Nakba (“Catastrophe”), the Six-Day War, the Oslo Accords after the first Intifada (“Uprising”), and the blockade of Gaza after the second. Video: Ta-Nehisi Coates on Palestine (27 mins) Author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates speaks to Democracy Now about his recent journey to the region, his shock at how closely it mirrored the segregationist America resisted by Martin Luther King Jr., and his commitment to non-violent opposition to Israel’s apartheid regime. Article: Everybody Wants Gaza’s Gas The oil and gas reserves off the Mediterranean coast are worth $500 billion. But according to the UN, Israel does not have sole legal entitlement to it. Some is in Palestine, and much of the rest beyond national borders, meaning it must be shared by both parties. Israel’s invasion of Gaza in 2008 illegally brought the Palestinian gas fields under sole Israeli control. The UN estimates billions of dollars in loss for the Palestinian people. Article: The Political Economy of Israeli Apartheid and the Spectre of Genocide Written in 2014, this analysis ties the Israeli state’s increasingly genocidal views towards Palestinians with changes in Israel’s economy, namely a burgeoning hi-tech-military-security sector requiring testbed conflict, and cheap labour from the Global South making Palestinian workers increasingly surplus to demand. The author worried genocide might loom. He has been proven terrifyingly prescient. Article: The ‘Desert’ Was Already Blooming An exploration of the links between colonialism and climate breakdown being experienced by Palestinians, and how climate justice means freedom for all. Features infographics by Visualising Palestine. Article: Israel’s Environmental Apartheid in Palestine An overview of how Israel has exploited the environment in Palestine/Israel, dispossessed Palestinians of their natural resources while leaving them with the pollution of that exploitation, and greenwashed the ecocidal nature of its actions. A doctor literally upholds the law at the Inner London Crown Court. Jurors in the UK have an absolute right to acquit a defendant according to their conscience. But it seems that this right, which has existed since the 17th century, is now seen as a threat to the British establishment following a series of jury acquittals where activists were cleared of wrongdoing despite having “no defence in law”. In response, judges have started limiting what defendants are allowed to say in front of the jury, sending people to prison for saying “climate change” or “fuel poverty” when stating their motivations. As one former government lawyer put it, “what does the right to fair trial mean if you can’t speak and explain why you did what you did?” In March, a retired social worker held up a sign outside court stating a jury’s right to decide on the basis of their conscience, and was promptly arrested. Ironically, she was sent to the Old Bailey, a criminal court in London, where a plaque bearing the same message is proudly displayed. People sit outside the Old Bailey, bearing the same message as a plaque inside. The shock of this arrest reverberated beyond the usual activist echo chambers, with people from all walks of life protesting the increasing corruption of the criminal court system. The placard-holding protests proliferated, and 40 people, including a priest and an Olympic athlete, wrote to the government to demand it “prosecute them too”. Soon after, Defend our Juries was born, a campaign dedicated to protecting the rights of jurors and defendants from the Government’s escalating attempts to undermine them. In September, the campaign held its first national day, with 252 people gathered around 25 crown courts across the country. A spokesperson described the movement as highly intersectional, with Extinction Rebellion, Palestine Action, Quakers, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil activists sitting alongside former policemen and lawyers. It is the latter for whom this issue cuts deepest, the spokesperson continued; fair trials by jury are what prevent abuse of power by courts, police, and ultimately the government. This affects the entire country. Defend our Juries will host a National Day of Action on 4th December.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/10/19/reflections-5-years-on/,"This letter contains the personal views of three co-founders of Extinction Rebellion. XR Global Support believes it will be of interest to rebels worldwide, and spark important debate on how we adapt to a rapidly heating world. Telling the truth means being ready to accept when you have been led astray, got things wrong and so have to modify your views. Five years since the launch of Extinction Rebellion, this world we live in is changing so dangerously fast that it demands we revisit our assumptions and learn some painful lessons. It is now clear that 2023 is very likely to average more than 1.5 °C above a 1850-1900 baseline. Whilst emissions are still rising world wide. It is only through commitment to the truth that we might help humanity and wider life around as we enter a disturbing new era. We got something wrong. We were misled. So, we misled you too. Aerosol pollution matters decisively to our global climate. There are other factors deserving of more serious attention such as forest cloud seeding and ocean health. Many factors were sidelined by scientists who were narrowly focusing on CO2. In addition, IPCC processes did not find an adequate way to address issues of extreme risk where data was deemed insufficient or where there was higher uncertainty *, such as aerosols, methane release from permafrost, and feedbacks from wildfires or droughts rendering sinks incapable of sustaining their role in the system. This misled other scientists, academics and activists including us. Some of us have attempted over the years to responsibly communicate the extreme and cascading risks, and the severe consequences of not taking emergency action. Despite founding the movement on the precautionary principle we found ourselves being ground down. For years we were moderated, and moodsplained by experts from narrow disciplines who demanded we change our press releases, our lectures, and play down the reality and potential speed of catastrophic consequences. As we pass into the horrors of a 1.5 °C plus world, at least 10 years earlier than the worst official expectations, we realise we should have made a firmer stand. As we observe some top climatologists claiming we need to wait decades before accepting that the planet is 1.5 °C warmer, we also realise that silence about our disagreements is no longer an option for us, or the climate movement. Understanding how this repression happened is important. We would welcome any career climatologists, academics and journalists who undermined our communications in public to make amends, especially as they have influenced attitudes amongst those who judge us. But more importantly, for the sake of life on Earth we must tackle this emergency with our eyes wide open to everything that we need to do from this point forward. The rapid heating and extreme events of the last year demonstrate that overall predictions of institutionalised climate science were less accurate than the conclusions of generalist scholars and leading climate activists, who better saw the frightening signals through the noise produced from siloes, hierarchies, and privilege. Notably, economists, politicians and consultants pulled the conversation in the opposite direction to what was needed. Because these people carry an identity associated with ‘authority’ they were not challenged enough by journalists, lay people, or activists. XR was always about responding to the whole ecological emergency, not just the climate. We need to bring this back to the fore, as much for the climate as for nature. We need to prioritise preserving and growing forest cover, learning how to restore the oceans' role in atmospheric modulation, experimenting with marine cloud brightening in the Arctic and exploring every option for climate restoration and cooling, and even consider reversing recent shipping fuel regulations if they are causing an aerosol ‘termination shock’. And at the same time we must reject the lie that high consumption societies do not need to power down equitably, with the rich going first. We waste vast amounts of energy, which is unspeakable in these circumstances. The rallying cry from here on is that we Must Stop Oil, end the fossil fuel era, and we must also urgently start the repair of Planet Earth, our only home. We are entering a new era for humanity and the prospects are terrifying. We committed five years ago in October 2018 to live in truth. Our movements need to look directly at that truth and act according to reality. That means being in resistance, standing for peace, justice and freedom.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/10/13/global-newsletter-81/,"Dutch rebels brave a police water cannon during an epic 4-week road blockade. This issue: XR Netherlands Mega-Blockade | XR NYC Rebellion | XR Taiwan Dear rebel, Climate breakdown has begun and the world in which we live is collapsing. That was the combined verdict of the UN chief and the pope after the world went through the hottest Northern Hemisphere summer on record. But it’s not just the heat that has been a death sentence for so many thousands. September saw a global wave of storms and flash floods that washed away entire communities, most devastatingly in Libya, where at least 11,000 have drowned. Meanwhile, the politicians with the power to stop this unravelling are avoiding climate summits, or rowing-back on already inadequate climate policies. And Big Oil backed think-tanks are criminalising climate protests and vilifying those who take part in them. Faced with this dystopian reality, our movement has responded with ingenuity and bravery. This month we feature rebel actions that show new levels of determination, that harness new tactics and alliances, and that take place in brand-new regions. Dutch rebels remain defiant in their stand against fossil fuel subsidies. In Action Highlights, we feature a road blockade in the Netherlands that lasted 27 days, saw 9,000 rebels arrested, and pushed the Dutch parliament to table new legislation that could see fossil fuel subsidies abolished. We also cover rebellion in New York, where XR NYC coordinated with dozens of allied organisations to create a week of action on the city streets. In Solidarity Corner we look at a fascinating new campaign that uses deepfake video, sophisticated PR, a fantasy modular iPhone, and good old-fashioned street protest to urge corporate giant Apple to embrace a sustainable business model. And finally, in Humans of XR we talk to a rebel helping to rekindle XR Taiwan, a part of the world we rarely get to cover in this newsletter. Rebels in New York are arrested during a blockade of the Federal Reserve. The era of global climate breakdown is here, and far sooner than most expected. But we do not have time to despair. Instead, we must prepare. For the devastation to come, for the widespread rage it will unleash, and for the actions that can channel that rage into protest - protests large enough to dethrone the elites who have led us off this cliff edge.

Donate What You Can 9 SEPT - 5 OCT | The Hague, Netherlands Rebels defy police water cannons that were so powerful they caused bruising. On the first day, rebel organisers expected 10,000 protesters. But by midday, 25,000 had arrived. Their mission: to blockade the A12, a major road running through The Netherlands’ political heart, and do this every day until the government abolished all subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. As with previous A12 blockades, the police quickly deployed powerful water cannons and beat the rebels with batons. 2400 were arrested, including dozens of minors. But the police violence did not stop the rebels from coming back. They returned, day after day, always at midday, their numbers bolstered by rebel delegations from Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and the UK. The police continued their intimidation, confiscating musical instruments (the orchestra played on), reporting underage rebels and their parents to the Dutch child protection service, and only turning off the water cannons once XR Netherlands took them to court. Despite police violence and intimidation, the blockades remained peaceful. Finally, after 27 days of continuous peaceful rebellion and more than 8,800 arrests, the blockade was suspended because of an amazing political turnaround. The government had submitted a motion to parliament calling for the “scaling down of different fossil fuel subsidies”. Rebels will not return to the streets until the motion has either been passed into law and assessed, or voted down. But whatever happens, this blockade has already become an iconic example of the power of peaceful civil disobedience. Current Dutch fossil fuel subsidies are estimated to be between 39.7 and 46.4 billion euros a year. The higher than expected figure emerged after recent independent research, and forced the government to admit that the subsidies were delaying a green energy transition. Follow the A12 Blockade campaign on Facebook and Twitter. 13 - 19 SEPT | New York, USA An alliance of activists blockade the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. Grounded helicopters, an occupied museum, blockaded banks, public nudity, and 186 arrests - just some of the headlines from the week-long Fall Rebellion that saw rebels from across the country converge on New York before the city hosted a UN Climate Ambition Summit. The rebellion was run according to a new strategy that saw dozens of climate groups protest alongside and in harmony with XR chapters. As an XR NYC activist explains, “each group would take a lead on a single action, with other groups and individuals joining as many actions as they could all over the city”. XR NYC opened the rebellion by disrupting helicopters at the city’s private heliport, with police ending the protest after 90 minutes. Meanwhile, 50 activists from an alliance of eco-groups blockaded the headquarters of BlackRock, a major funder of new fossil fuel projects, and four naked rebels gatecrashed a runway of New York Fashion Week. Citi bankers get upset when activists blockade their ecocidal workplace. The rebel alliance returned the next morning to blockade all ten entrances to the headquarters of Citibank, which claims climate leadership while being the world’s second-largest funder of fossil fuels ($332 billion since the Paris Agreement). Angry bankers tried (and failed) to push through the hundreds of activists to get to work. The blockade tactics were repeated at the Federal Reserve Bank, where so many activists were arrested they had to queue down Wall Street in handcuffs waiting for police to bus them away. The tactics were used again at the Museum of Modern Art, which has ties to a billionaire involved in fossil fuel projects on Indigenous land, and was forced to close for the day when rebels occupied it for over five hours. People of the Wetʼsuwetʼen Nation blockade the Museum of Modern Art for ties to a billionaire who is funding an illegal gas pipeline across their land. The pinnacle of the rebellion was a vast march that saw tens of thousands of climate activists, scientists, indigenous groups, and unions pour through the city to demand an end to fossil fuels. Part of a global wave organised by March To End Fossil Fuels, it demonstrated the amazing alliances being forged in the city. “We have a very strong and diverse coalition going on in New York”, says our XR NYC source. “We invited people from all over the country, they helped with logistics, led protests, did jail support – it was a huge melting pot that brought thousands together. And for the next rebellion, we’ll invite the world”. Follow XR NYC on Twitter and Instagram. 13 SEPTEMBER | Denmark: Victory! Danske Bank has divested from corrupt coal giant Adani Group after a sustained campaign by Scientist Rebellion Denmark and other eco-groups. Activism works! 15 - 17 SEP | Worldwide: More than 600,000 people join marches all around the world to demand an end to fossil fuels. The historic weekend of action was organised by Global Fight To End Fossil Fuels in alliance with thousands of organisations, including XR and Fridays For Future. Marches took place in 60 countries (even the North Pole) and culminated in New York, where world leaders were meeting for the UN Climate Ambition Summit.

Check out more images from the symbolic sit-downs on the Mothers Rebellion website. Photos: Sweden (Jonathan Pye) India, UK, Zimbabwe. 15 SEP | Melbourne, Australia: Rebels rally against seismic blasting exploration for gas off the south Victorian coast, a home to whales and other precious marine life. They visited Australia’s offshore energy regulator to demand an end to gas extraction, which releases vast amounts of methane - a greenhouse gas 86 times more warming than CO2. Photo: Julian Meehan 15 SEP | Kampala, Uganda: Police arrest 4 student climate activists as they protest against the banks funding EACOP (East African Crude Oil Pipeline). One activist required emergency medical assistance after their arrest. They were imprisoned for five days for “causing inconvenience to the public” before being released on bail. 19 - 21 SEP | Johannesburg, South Africa: XR Gauteng occupies the HQ of Standard Bank, demanding the institution openly discuss its fossil fuel financing. Private security dragged the rebels (and a reporter) from the lobby and knocked one unconscious. Undeterred, the group set up a protest camp outside the building. After 3 days, security used punches, kicks, and choke holds to clear the camp. One rebel was dragged into the bank HQ by police and held for 4 hours before being transferred to a police station and held overnight. XR Gauteng are planning an even larger demonstration at Standard Bank in the near future. 21 SEPT | Brazil: Victory! The Supreme Court rejects a proposal that could have legalised the theft of indigenous lands by extractive industries. Hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people faced being evicted by mining, drilling, and farming corporations if they could not prove they were living on their land on October 5, 1988, the day the national Constitution was signed. Days after the verdict, a new reserve for uncontacted tribes in Peru was approved by the Peruvian government after a 17- year campaign. Photo: Tukumā Pataxó / APIB 22 SEPT | Paris, France: Rebels and activists from ATTAC France occupy Le Bourget Airport. They cut through fences and planted fruit trees on the runway to stop the ultra-rich from using their ecocidal private jets for the weekend. Police arrived quickly and arrested 13 activists. 23 SEPT | Ghent, Belgium: For the fourth time, rebels hold a ‘civil disobedience picnic’ on the city’s inner ring road. 135 activists gathered on the tarmac to demand their government stop subsidising the fossil fuel industry by 13 billion euros every year. After 14 hours, the police intervened and 14 rebels were arrested. 25 SEPT | Banjul, Gambia: XR Gambia hold their first climate change seminar. 25 SEPT | UK: 240 people across the UK replicate an action by a rebel now threatened with prison for holding a sign outside court. The rebel held up her sign about the rights of juries during a climate trial in March. She did it because the judge banned the climate activists being prosecuted from mentioning climate change in their defence. Civil liberty campaigners believe her prosecution is part of an escalating attack on the right to protest by the UK’s government. 28 SEPT | Vienna, Austria: Rebels block one lane of a major road in the city centre to protest the construction of a new motorway. They brought a 6m wooden scaffold and chained themselves within metal pipes, creating a taste of the traffic-jam future that the A26 will bring. The fossil mega-project has seen costs balloon by 60% since planning began, and rebels demanded that the 1.19 billion euros be used for healthcare, education, and nature preservation instead. The Act Different website launches the iPhone Infinite. In September, an international collective of over 50 activists, including rebels and “laughtivists” (humour-based activists) from The Yes Men, launched Act Different. The website contains swish animations, photos, even the pricing plan, of a brand-new iPhone, the iPhone Infinity: a modular, repairable, and customisable iPhone with a low environmental impact that could last for a lifetime! Better yet, you can watch the CEO of Apple launch not just the iPhone Infinity but also an entire new business model - one that sees the world’s biggest company put the wellbeing of Apple workers and the planet above corporate profits. Sadly, the iPhone Infinity is not real, and nor is the sustainable new business model. The CEO presentation is a deepfake video created with the help of AI. But this campaign is so convincing that you might just believe it could be! And that is exactly what the creators wanted. They call it a psychomagic act, a therapeutic visualisation tactic to show people what true corporate social responsibility could look like. Activists in London add the iPhone Infinity to Apple’s in store devices (left) and activists in Edinburgh give a talk outside an Apple store (right) The collective have worked for months on the project, and have already caught some media attention. But this is only the beginning. All across the world, rebels and other activists have been visiting Apple stores to advertise the Apple Infinity, and to talk to customers about sustainable production and the right to repair. The campaign aims to bring together Apple stakeholders, including manufacturers, employees and consumers, to pressure the company to not just ‘think different’ but act different. To do this, the collective have created the Apple Alliance, a working group committed to reshaping Apple. In an open letter to the Apple CEO (the real one, not the AI version!), they invite him to join this Alliance to make positive change. His response is pending, but the campaign will continue, with or without him! Visit the Act Different website, follow them on Instagram, and sign their petition. Jen (right) with fellow members of XR Taiwan. Their banners read ‘Extinction Rebellion’ and ‘This is an emergency’ in Mandarin. I’m from the USA but have been living in Taiwan for seven years now. In 2019, I set up a local XR group in Taipei. I’d become increasingly anxious about the state of the climate, and the total lack of an adequate response from the world’s governments. At the time, there wasn’t much climate activism going on around me, and I worked hard to get XR Taiwan established. But personal events meant I had to withdraw in 2021. In the past months, I’ve had a bit more time and energy to devote to activism, so I worked with friends to revive the group. For our first action, a few of us who normally meet online gathered in a park for a meditation session, and we laid out banners with a QR code so passers-by could find us on Facebook. It wasn’t a huge event, but it felt really good to meet up in person and get things going again. My decision to get back into activism was partly prompted by becoming a mother. My responsibility as a parent has made me feel the urgency of the climate emergency even more intensely. I know I can’t do everything, but I need to do something. I want my child to know that I tried to do what I could. I’m also a teacher, and I care so much for my students, for what their futures will look like. Living in Taiwan, we are all too aware of the great danger of rising sea levels. With the crisis accelerating, it is easy to fall into despair, but I try to remain hopeful. Being part of the international XR community brings me hope and strength. Forging links with other groups, seeing others around the world acting and building community is so inspiring to me. I know that burnout is a real risk. You can get so enthused and ambitious, take on way too much, then get overwhelmed. I’ve learned to be wiser, to not overload myself, to just do what I can, so that I can keep going over the long term. As a Buddhist, I find meditation to be a deep source of support. It feels like the increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters are waking more and more people up and are bringing more people into activism. This gives me hope. So does the XR global community: I have felt a lot of warmth and support since returning. Though none of this is easy, I have hope - and I’m ready for our next actions.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/09/29/wrong-side-of-history/,"Last week’s appalling announcement by the UK Government that it intends to backtrack on key climate commitments is a warning for everyone. Even the limited progress to date in tackling the climate and ecological emergency (CEE) cannot be taken for granted; there’s no let up in the efforts of those attempting to block and delay action. A liveable planet is something we have to keep fighting for. Downing Street, London - image by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay Recent months have demonstrated the willingness of the current UK Government to pursue climate harming policies. Approval of a new coal mine in Cumbria and licences for extraction in the North Sea went forward despite being widely criticised. A by-election where opposition to expansion of the London ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) was claimed to have affected the result, led the Prime Minister (PM) to declare that he was “on the side” of motorists. The roll-out of reduced urban speed limits across Wales was also proving to be a controversial and polarising issue. All of this had intensified debate around green policies and their associated costs; in particular, whether they could be used as a “wedge issue” to gain political advantage at the upcoming UK general election. With the government trailing badly in opinion polls, a reckless move in this direction was viewed as a definite possibility; yet the timing and the way in which it happened left many reeling, including members of their own party. The planned announcement was rushed forward, after parts of the speech were leaked and triggered an immediate backlash. As the world’s politicians met at the UN in New York to discuss doing more to tackle the climate crisis, British PM Rishi Sunak was outlining his plans to do less. His claims that the UK was on target to achieve net zero targets directly contradicted the latest assessment by the government’s own independent advisers. In a bizarre twist, he also announced that he was scrapping proposals that had never even existed. The speech was condemned in the UK and abroad as jeopardising the future of our planet for short-term electoral benefit. Extinction Rebellion (XR) does not align itself with any political parties or advocate for specific solutions. However, there will clearly be policies (whoever proposes them) which take us in the direction of achieving our demands and others that don’t - it’s clear this announcement falls firmly into the latter category. What it also highlights are significant issues with impacts extending way beyond the UK. Whilst UK influence on the international stage has undoubtedly diminished post Brexit, what happens in Britain still has wider implications. Being the birthplace of the industrial revolution and one of the largest sources of historical emissions places a unique responsibility on the UK to be at the forefront of decarbonisation efforts. The UK was the first country to introduce legally binding carbon reduction targets. In 2019 it became the first country to declare a climate emergency and the first major economy to put a requirement to achieve net zero into law. Sadly, the UK has subsequently made nowhere near enough progress in delivering against these promises; something that will be compounded by this latest backtracking. The announcement further undermines the UK's ability to provide global leadership and sets an extremely dangerous precedent. Many politicians around the world reacted with horror and disbelief to last week’s announcements. However, others will no doubt be watching closely to see whether following a similar path might benefit them electorally. Ironbridge - birthplace of the industrial revolution - image by ian kelsall from Pixabay The clear scientific consensus is that we need to reduce carbon emissions as rapidly as possible. 2050 is a completely arbitrary deadline, which in no way represents a desirable or safe timescale. We’re seeing horrific evidence of the damage we’ve already caused to our planet every day, much of which will be irreversible. The sooner we reduce emissions, the less severe the consequences will ultimately be. The speech attempted to justify the proposed changes with claims the UK was ahead of other countries and could afford to slow progress, whilst remaining on track to reach net zero by 2050. This was an unambiguous example of the 2050 deadline being used as justification for delaying action on the CEE. Let’s be clear - no country can afford to slow its progress. The statistic frequently used by the UK Government to support claims of world leading progress is an almost 50% reduction in emissions since 1990. Whilst this figure isn’t incorrect, it presents an incomplete picture, as it’s based on territorial emissions. These are emissions generated within territorial boundaries of a country and exclude those associated with imported goods and international air travel. The UK imports far more goods than it exports, and research in 2019 showed UK citizens taking more international flights than any other nationality (total number, not just per capita). It’s therefore not difficult to see why territorial emissions would be the UK Government’s preferred measure. The problem is this massively understates the environmental impact of the UK and facilitates the deflection of blame towards countries such as China, which manufacture and export goods to meet UK demand. The claim that the UK is only responsible for around 1% of global emissions also ignores the UK’s leading role in funding fossil fuels globally. A 2021 report found that UK financial institutions were responsible for 1.8 times the UK’s annual carbon emissions. Buildings in the City of London - image by Joe from Pixabay The famous quote in the heading above shouldn’t be misinterpreted as suggesting statistics are another form of lies and that no reliance should be placed on them. Accurate statistics have a vital role to play in enhancing our understanding and assisting decision making. However, we need to be alert to the way in which statistics can be manipulated and used selectively in order to create a very misleading picture. Many politicians and corporations around the world are accused of doing exactly this, to create the impression they’re doing far more to address the CEE than is actually the case. In the speech it was repeatedly claimed that the changes represented a rejection of short-termism. This was probably a recognition that short-term gain certainly appeared to be the primary motivation. Some recent polling suggested that key voters needed by the government to retain power would be receptive to the watering-down of some net zero commitments. One of the issues identified was concerns around potential costs. Excessively heavy emphasis on costs within the speech appeared cynically targeted at these voters. It’s difficult to view this as anything other than a clear example of short-term political expediency driving policy, rather than making decisions that are the best ones in the medium to long term. It illustrates how our current political systems create incentives to prioritise winning the next election ahead of doing what is actually in everyone’s best future interests. The UK government pushed back the date for phasing out petrol and diesel cars - Image by Andreas Lischka from Pixabay XR advocates for citizens' assemblies as a means to inform and involve ordinary people in decision making. You can read more about how they can help address problems with our political systems in this guest blog. The UK Government was criticised for politicising the work of its own independent political advisers, the Climate Change Committee. Attempts to undermine the legitimacy of even the most reliable and authoritative sources of information are a worrying trend not limited to the UK. XR’s first demand is that governments tell the truth about the CEE and the actions necessary to address it. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that limiting global warming required “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. Many people have concerns not only about the CEE, but also how it will impact their own lives. In the absence of trustworthy sources of information, these fears can be exploited and misinformation can flourish. In many cases, those affected most severely by the CEE are the ones who have contributed least to creating it. It’s essential that climate justice is embedded within solutions. We need a just transition, which helps reduce and remove inequalities rather than exacerbating them. Support for climate action risks being undermined by concerns that the impacts will not be shared fairly. Last week’s speech was criticised for containing numerous misleading claims about costs and changes that might be imposed. It suggested those calling for faster action were driven by “ideological zeal” and unconcerned about costs and disruption to ordinary families; seemingly more interested in promoting division than bringing people together. It warned moving too fast risked losing the consent of the public, yet made no mention of projections that delaying action would actually prove far more costly. The irresponsibility of politicians deliberately adding to misinformation and fears for short-term political gain cannot be overstated. The way in which lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry are able to influence policy makers is a global issue. Nowhere is this more blatant than COP28, which will be chaired by the Chief Executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company - it’s difficult to imagine a more obvious conflict of interest. The current UK Government makes little effort to disguise its close links with the ‘think tanks’ of Tufton Street. These think tanks are secretive about their sources of funding, but it’s extremely clear whose interests their work benefits. Increasingly draconian anti-protest legislation introduced by the UK Government has been linked back to them. Climate campaigners in the UK are being jailed for mentioning the climate emergency in their defence in court. Contempt of court proceedings have been initiated against a protestor for simply holding a sign outside a court reminding jurors that they could act in accordance with their conscience. It’s clear that the influence of these lobbyists is extremely harmful to both democracy and our planet. Oil rigs in Scotland - image by Elliott Day from Pixabay Politicians misleading the public and delaying climate action for short-term electoral gain are no better than the oil companies who knew, but hid the truth about the harm they were causing. History’s verdict on those still determined to continue along this ecocidal path will not be kind. Sadly, the prospect of being viewed as amongst the worst criminals in history appears to be insufficient deterrent. Their unwillingness to change course means it falls to ordinary people like us to do everything in our power to stop them.

Photo: Fernando Muñoz-Miño This issue: Ecuador Stops Oil | XR Sudan | Adriatic Climate Camp | Dear rebel, This issue, we have something rare and exciting for you: good news. It starts with our report on Ecuador, where the public have voted to ban oil drilling in the Amazon in a national referendum that might be the first of many in the region. XR Ecuador contributed to this amazing political victory. Find out how by heading to Action Highlights. The good news continues in Action Round Up, where we bring you a beautiful update on the struggle to close an illegal coal mine in Wales, as well as a ground-breaking court victory for young climate activists in Montana, USA. Rebels at the Adriatic Climate Camp access a nearby gas terminal. But this is climate activism, and the pure positivity can only last so long. In Action Highlights, we report on a second Adriatic Climate Camp in Croatia, where a beautiful five-day camp for rebels everywhere was marred by police violence. Also in this issue, the founder of XR Sudan tells the courageous, tragic, moving story of their group in Humans of XR. It is a tale of democracy crushed, of state torture and murder, of the incalculable devastation of war, and the unfathomable bravery of rebels who believe in their cause. Members of XR Sudan in 2019, the year of its founding. This newsletter rarely gets to dabble in good news, but when it comes to tales of inspiring, fearless activism, we are always spoilt for choice. Whether it be in war-torn Khartoum, on a Croatian island, or along the edge of the Amazon, ordinary people are standing up and demanding better for this planet. It’s their heroism that makes the bleakness of this global crisis bearable, and allows this newsletter to brim with hope as well as heartache, issue after issue.

Donate What You Can 20 AUGUST | Ecuador This is a story about a victory ten years in the making. The decision to put fossil fuel extraction in a biodiversity hotspot to a democratic, nation-wide vote was historic. But then, on the day of asking, the people of Ecuador chose to kick the oil industry out of Yasuní National Park. 58% voted to keep a billion barrels of oil firmly in the ground. Yasuní, located in Ecuador’s east on the border with Peru, is designated a UNESCO world biosphere reserve and is home to many hundreds of bird, fish, mammal and reptile species. Petroecuador, Ecuador's state-owned oil company, is now legally required to halt fossil fuel operations in the region and dismantle its infrastructure. XR Ecuador launched a public information campaign to support the protection of Yasuní and ensure engagement in the referendum. A rebel involved explains: 'many people did not know that there was going to be a referendum or did not know how to vote because the question was formulated in a complicated way. And we also had to fight a huge disinformation campaign that was launched by fossil fuel companies'. Members of XR Ecuador in Quito vote in the referendum. XR LATAM (Latin America) also joined the campaign, encouraging local groups from across the continent to show their support for the referendum in video messages and solidarity actions. Activists in neighbouring countries are already planning how to follow Ecuador’s example. But it was YASunidos, a civil society organisation founded ten years ago and dedicated to the protection of the Yasuní, that made the historic referendum possible. They quickly collected the 750,000 signatures to enable it, then won a long legal battle when the former government tried to void half of the names. 'The result is an opportunity to think about a different kind of economy, and it gives a lot of hope', says our rebel source. 'After ten long years of campaigning, it was a moment that many of us in Ecuador have been waiting for. However, we don’t think that this is over. A lot of Ecuador is divided up between mining companies. We can’t rest, despite this victory'. XR Argentina hold a Yasuní solidarity rally outside the Ecuadorian embassy. The government initially voiced support for the referendum, but Ecuador's president has already indicated he plans to ignore the result of the vote. 'It is up to the constitutional court to make sure that the will of the people is carried out', says our rebel source. 'What’s important now is to make noise at an international and local level to defend our democracy'. Rebels and grassroots communities are organising to protect the result, and protect the National Park from other types of exploitation like mining. Residents of Quito, Ecuador’s capital, also voted overwhelmingly to ban gold and copper mining in the Chocó Andino reserve, a biodiversity hotspot 40km from the city.

After a successful debut in 2022, the Adriatic Climate Camp returned this summer with twice the turnout. Around 160 rebels gathered on the Croatian island of Krk for XR Zagreb’s five-day festival centred around community, learning, and the peaceful disruption of a nearby Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal. But despite the right to peaceful gathering being set in Croatian law, and despite XR Zagreb liaising with the police over safety, the final protest at the state-owned LNG terminal, which is a large international importer for the EU, was met with violence. 26 activists braved the sea and police water cannons to enter the terminal and unfurl banners. After being shoved back by private security, a delegation of waiting riot police then pinned down the protesters, keeping them in painful pressure holds before throwing them into vans and driving them to custody cells. There, they were held for up to ten hours with no food, water, medical help, or phone calls. Snapshots of Adriatic camp life: socialising, vegan food, trainings, protest. XR Zagreb is exploring options for legal action against the police and security, but the violence in no way deflated the camp, nor reduced the hunger for another one. Organisers promise to adapt the camp next year to avoid waiting riot police. Rebels came from across Europe to take part in the camp’s daily workshops, trainings, entertainment, and vegan food, with a few even travelling from as far as New Zealand and the USA. A third of the attendees were not even ecoactivists - this was also a space for human rights, gay rights, animal rights and anarchist groups. As well as a space for sharing activism ideas and know-how, the camp held trainings in climbing and kayaking, and hosted drama, speed-dating, and stand-up comedy nights. And after the last detained rebel was released, the camp concluded with a big celebration on the beach. Follow XR Zagreb on Facebook and Instagram for Adriatic Climate Camp news. 2 AUGUST | Germany: Rebel actions were held in Nürnberg and cities across Germany on Earth Overshoot Day. August 2nd was the day when humanity used up all the resources the planet could sustainably provide for the whole year. For comparison, in 1971, Earth Overshoot Day fell on December 25th. Capitalism requires infinite economic growth, and that means our planetary boundaries are being increasingly disregarded. 2 AUG | Ōtautahi Christchurch, New Zealand: Restore Passenger Rail returns to the streets for a very slow march around Canterbury University campus. The group wants their government to restore passenger rail travel throughout the country, with a railway line from the C.19th already set up for most of the routes. 5 AUG | Amsterdam, The Netherlands: LGBTQIA+ rebels disrupt Canal Pride Amsterdam with a banner calling for queer rebels to take action against fossil fuel subsidies. Banners were also dropped that celebrated trans people and refugees, and dismissed the ‘rainbow’ capitalism of the event’s corporate sponsors. 13 AUG | Seoul, South Korea: Rebels hold a sharing event to try and re-establish a safe community. XR Seoul was shaken by an incident of sexual harassment last year, and the group suspended all actions to focus on resolving the issue. Progress has been made, but the healing process continues. 14 AUG | Montana, USA: Victory! Young climate activists win a ground-breaking court case. A Montana judge ruled that state agencies were violating their constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment by allowing fossil fuel development. The state will appeal. If the verdict stands, it will set an amazing precedent for future climate litigation. Photo: Robin Loznak 15 AUG | Wales, UK: Victory! The UK's biggest opencast coal mine will finally close in November! The announcement comes after a sustained campaign by rebels and locals against the illegal coal mine, including a two-day blockade in July. XR Cymru demanded the mine workers be retrained for the site restoration work ahead. 21 AUG | Jinja, Uganda: XR Great Lakes Region holds a workshop with local school children about the climate crisis. The visit was part of an educational tour that began earlier in the month. It included rehabilitating a local water source and visiting Itanda Falls, which is threatened by a hydroelectric dam funded by China EXIM Bank (also a funder of the EACOP pipeline). 28 AUG | Nevada, USA: Activists from XRNYC, Scientist Rebellion and Rave Revolution block the road into ‘Burning Man’ festival, demanding that its organisers ban private jets and single-use plastics. The festival has a ridiculous carbon footprint and is basically a temporary city in the desert. But drivers reacted angrily, and police reacted violently, driving directly into the blockade and wrestling the protesters to the ground with guns raised. Four were arrested and face trial in October. You can hear from two of them by listening to this XR LA podcast. Ironically enough, a few days later the police were forced to close the same road after extreme storms turned the desert into mud, trapping 70,000 festival-goers with limited food and water. 1 SEPTEMBER | DRC, UK: Rebels in the UK and DRC hold simultaneous protests against Anglo-French oil company Perenco. Activists rallied outside its London HQ (top) and in Moanda (bottom left), an impoverished area in the DRC which Perenco is exploiting for oil. XR Moanda was recently formed thanks to the ‘Petrole Non Merci’ campaign, with rebels from XR Goma University touring the country to raise resistance against the 27 ‘oil blocks’ recently sold by the Congolese government to Perenco. Two weeks earlier they helped form another new chapter, XR Lobolo (bottom right), in Yahuma territory, a peatland region containing one of Perenco’s new oil blocks. 4 - 6 SEP | Nairobi, Kenya: Rebels from across Africa converge on the Kenyan capital to protest outside the African Climate Summit, a new three-day conference attended by (some of) Africa’s leaders to discuss… green growth and climate finance! Hundreds of activists marched for total system change rather than more financial greenwashing, and rallied for the cancellation of Global South debts. They were not heard. The summit’s final declaration was met with heavy disappointment. I first learned about climate change a long time ago. I don’t remember exactly when. But at university, my knowledge and activity around environmental issues increased, and I understood how countries like mine in the Global South are less responsible yet more affected by the climate crisis. This left me with the urgent question, why don’t we raise our voices? I was introduced to XR while watching the news. I searched the internet and social media for more information. Seeing XR groups in the Global North using peaceful protest to garner global attention inspired me. I felt like rushing out and taking action against the ecocidal crimes committed by my government and global corporations! I founded XR Sudan at the beginning of 2019. The group had 12 active members, and there were two more local groups, the Ahfad Girls’ Group and the Darfur Region Sons’ Group. Over the next three years we launched many actions. We ran awareness campaigns about the climate crisis and eco-crimes in Sudan in universities and neighbourhoods across Khartoum. We rallied in front of embassies during the G7 summit and against the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. We discussed the illegal logging of Sudan’s forests and carried out local clean-ups. We also joined pro-democracy protests on the streets of the capital. People supported us and asked us to keep pressure on the government. They had seen the severe weather in Sudan, and the devastating floods, crop failure, and other disasters that resulted, in addition to many terrible environmental crimes, like the burying of Chinese and Iranian nuclear waste in the country. XR Sudan joins pro-democracy marches in Khartoum, July 2020. But on October 25, 2021, a military coup took place in Sudan. We continued to organise our peaceful activism as usual, but we noticed the security forces watching our movements. We were attacked by a militia called the Rapid Support Forces. They shot at us, and as we ran to hide from the bullets, a member of our group called Muhammad was hit twice in the chest and fell as a martyr. Dr. Muhammad Abdul Rahim was just 27 years old and passionate about environmental issues and the climate crisis. After joining XR Sudan, he helped to launch a Covid-19 awareness campaign in the most crowded areas of the capital, and coordinated planet preservation festivals in primary schools. When we went to our friend Dr. Muhammad’s funeral, soldiers arrested me and two others. We were placed in Soba prison, where we were psychologically and physically tortured. They falsely accused us of terrorism and being a “foreign agent,” charges they often use against democracy activists to cover up the accusers’ crimes. I was absolutely certain that they would kill me, as they killed Muhammad and so many other activists. But a month later, the former Prime Minister brokered a deal with the military, and one condition was the release of all political activists. I was released along with the other two members. However, the security forces soon came back to arrest me. Again, I managed to escape, but they hunted me for six months. Whenever I felt insecure, I moved to another place. It was a difficult and harsh period, and I decided to seek safety outside of Sudan. XR Sudan visits the director of Khartoum Water on World Water Day, March 2021 (top left), provides health education, masks, and sterilisers during the Covid outbreak, January 2021 (bottom left), and protests outside the embassies of the G7 during their summit, June 2021 (right). The war in Sudan now is not a civil war, despite what some say in the media. The truth is that neocolonialism is the root cause. Sudan has vast resources of gold and uranium and oil that have made it a target for a long time, and countries are now arming the militias in order to prolong the war and plunder Sudan amid the chaos. This war has left the capital Khartoum and the Darfur region completely destroyed. Thousands of my people have been killed and millions displaced. In Darfur, militias are carrying out ethnic cleansing, replacing the indigenous population with people from neighbouring countries who belong to their tribes. Sudan is now going through a dangerous historical juncture. Either there will be a unified sovereign state, or Sudan will become divided and destroyed. I ask those reading this to pray for my country, to listen to this beautiful podcast that explains the conflict so well, and to consider donating to the Sudan emergency funds of UNHCR, Islamic Relief, or Médecins Sans Frontières. The spirit among the XR Sudan team taught me the meaning of participatory work. We worked hard to ensure the safety of our planet and future generations, and stand against injustice and human rights violations. I learned determination, patience and persistence, and that there is hope for a better, healthy and clean future. Muhammad died, but he did not die among us. If you know (or are) a rebel somewhere in the world with a story to tell, get in touch at xr-newsletter@protonmail.com The title pretty well explains this book—it is a complete briefing on climate change. The current, most up-to-date edition is the fifth, but older editions are still useful as the basic science has not changed much over the decades. Of course, where we are in the process of this disaster has shifted. The author intends this work as a kind of textbook suitable for everyone from high school to graduate school. It is introductory, but written with scholarly thoroughness and depth. The text is quite dry, for the most part, as it makes no pretence about what it is, a book about an important branch of science. And yet no particular scientific expertise is necessary to read it. There are facts and figures but no equations. Important concepts are explained. Technical terms are minimised. Climate change is the issue of our time, and while simplified talking points are enough to get an activist started, sooner or later it becomes important to really understand the science. That’s when it’s time to reach for the complete briefing. Avoid Amazon. Support bookshops. Buy your books at Bookshop or Hive. Download Now The 1st issue of the XR Disabled rebels' network zine, now titled ‘Unconquerable Voices’, is available for download. Disabled people are at greater risk than able-bodied people in our climate crisis. This is due to stigma along with barriers imposed by our society and the environment. Yet disabled people have largely been left out of actions and discussions about climate change. ‘Unconquerable Voices’ seeks to rectify this. ‘Unconquerable Voices’ is a collection of artwork, poetry, personal anecdotes and much more by disabled people, expressing their experiences of disability in the context of climate change. Nothing about us without us. Download the issue. Promo and download tutorial videos also available.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/08/11/global-newsletter-79/,"A Turkish activist tries to stop the illegal destruction of a forest by a coal mining company. Photo: kazimkizil This issue: XR Cymru vs. Coal Mine | Turkish Villagers vs. Coal Mine | This Is Rigged | XR Colombia Dear rebel, July was the hottest month on record for planet Earth. Temperatures soared across the globe, resulting in vast wildfires across North America, Europe, and northern Africa, and flash flooding over the baked soils of Asia. With hellish heat waves, vanishing Antarctic ice, and oceans as warm as hot tubs, it’s difficult to argue with the UN chief’s assessment that the “era of global boiling has arrived.” For even the most privileged and powerful of our planet, the climate crisis is no longer an abstract threat. This season, its disastrous effects are visible through the windows or on the TV screens of every continent. Yet the governments of the Global North remain wedded to their fossil fuels. In some cases, they’ve doubled down. XR UK’s beloved pink boat sails in to blockade an illegal coal mine in Wales. How to explain such suicidal decision-making? Yes, our leaders (and their political parties) are being enriched by Big Oil money. And capitalism has normalised a mindset where short-term profit is all that matters. But how can any human take the cash, if the cost is the world burning, civilisation ending, and billions dying? A co-founder of XR has an intriguing explanation for this disconnect, one based on the anatomy of the human brain, the psychology of the human mind, and ancient social trauma. You can hear her expand on her theory, and explain what it means for the climate movement, in Must Reads. In Action Highlights, we focus on two remarkable protests thousands of miles apart, both against coal mines operating illegally but being protected by the state. Whether it be the green valleys of Wales or the ancient forests of Turkey, it seems there is one (increasingly repressive) law for peaceful protesters, and no laws at all for ecocidal coal companies. Activists from new group This Is Rigged (TIR) occupy a Scottish oil tanker truck. This issue, we also get to know a daring new climate group promising to shut down the Scottish oil industry in Splinter Group of the Month, and we meet a rebel from XR Orinoquía, based in eastern Colombia, in Humans of XR.

Early one morning, a bright pink boat appeared at the entrance to the Ffos-y-Fran coal mine, close to the town of Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales. A brave crew of over a dozen XR Cymru (XR Wales) and XR UK rebels put down anchor across the access road of the UK’s largest opencast coal mine, effectively shutting it down. This filthy eyesore of a mine has been extracting carbon-rich coal, polluting the local area, and directly harming human health for sixteen years. However, the mine has been operating illegally since September 2022, when the local council rejected the mine owner’s application to continue extracting coal at the site. Campaigners – both locals and those from further afield – have been fighting for years to get the mine closed down, but this most recent breach of the law pushed them to take bolder action. An alliance of rebels, activists & locals rally at the edge of the Ffos-y-Fran coal mine. That's why several rebels chained themselves to their iconic boat, while others held banners and placards around it. South Wales Police officers were swift to arrive, but waited until the next day to arrest four of the activists. Days later a family-friendly march to the mine organised by Coal Action Network was attended by over 100 people from XR, Just Stop Oil, Greenpeace, and more. Outrageous new UK protest laws mean the locked-on rebels could receive one-year jail terms, and their harsh bail conditions stipulated that they not discuss the action on any social media or public platform. Local rebels and other activists are determined to shut down the illegal mine. Meanwhile, the company that owns the illegally-running mine is appealing the council’s decision to end their licence. This process could take up to a year, during which time they plan to continue operating! Even a final demand from the UK Coal Authority to stop extraction, delivered weeks after the protest, has not been enough to close the mine. The same activist alliance is now planning its next move. Rebels are determined to end coal mining in Ffos-y-Fran, and will do everything in their power to get this illegal blight on the landscape – and the climate – closed for good.

Photo: kazimkizil Local villagers and activists from across Turkey (some of them former rebels) united to try to stop an ancient forest from being illegally destroyed to make way for a coal mine. Police broke up the blockade using a water cannon, pepper spray, and violence. 40 people were arrested across the six days of protest. The tree-felling was illegal because of an ongoing lawsuit between the villagers and the mining company, which is co-owned by two giant corporations that also own power plants in the area and have close ties with the government. The villagers put out a call for help when workers wielding chainsaws entered the forest accompanied by a large police guard. Buses full of activists, organised by many Turkish climate groups, started arriving from cities across Turkey within hours, though many were intercepted by police en route. Riot police used a water cannon, pepper spray, and violence to break the blockade. Faced with riot police happy to use pepper spray and baton strikes, the mostly elderly villagers and peaceful activists were unable to stop the forest being massacred. The villagers had battled in the courts for four years to save their forest, but it took less than one week for 65,000 trees to be felled. This is not the end of the story, though. The villagers and activists have vowed to keep fighting for what forest remains, and to stop the open pit coal mine from expanding until the lawsuit is ruled on. A further 37 villages could be threatened if the corporations fully exploit the lignite coal seam being mined. A campaign has started to boycott Limak Holding, one of the mega-corporations involved. There are calls for Barcelona football club to publicly cancel a contract for Limak to renovate its stadium, too. And more actions are still being planned by activists across Turkey. Villagers watch as their forest is destroyed. But they have vowed to keep fighting. These protests are not being planned by XR as such, since XR Turkey dissolved in 2020 after a rebel was accused of sexual abuse, and efforts to relaunch the group the next year floundered. Members moved on to other environmental groups. But despite the recent re-election of an illiberal government that happily jails activists, journalists, and political opponents, activism in Turkey is flourishing. Two years ago a huge number of local environmental groups, leftist political parties, trade unions, and academics, came together to form the Climate Justice Coalition. Follow the campaign to save Akbelen on Twitter. 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 JULY | The Netherlands: Rebels take part in a ‘Hot ING Summer Tour’, with actions outside offices of ING bank across the Netherlands each week. Since the 2015 Paris accords, ING have invested more than 51 billion euros in climate breakdown. As global temperatures rise, so do rebel actions! 4 JULY | UK, Japan, USA, Canada: Rebels and FFF activists stand in solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en First Nation to protest against the vast Coastal GasLink pipeline crossing their unceded territory in British Columbia, Canada. Letters were delivered to banks that have invested in the pipeline, demanding they withdraw support. 5 - 6 JULY | Bregenz, Austria: Rebels block the state parliament by chaining themselves to three wooden tripods and a 7-metre-long pink boat! Clearing the blockade proved to be a major challenge for the police, who managed to injure one protester before arresting 20. The next day, rebels returned to the building to form a human chain around it. The actions were protesting the millions of euros spent by the state on fossil fuel mega projects like the “Spider Tunnel” road construction. 8 JULY | New York, USA: Around 40 activists from XR NYC and Rise & Resist silently sit beside exhibits at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This was the second protest in two weeks to condemn the excessive charges pressed against two members of Declare Emergency for their action at the National Gallery of Art in April. 11 JULY | Kampala, Uganda: Four activists, three of them women, are violently arrested by police during a peaceful march against Standard Chartered Bank and its financing of the EACOP pipeline. They were later released on police bond. 14 JULY | Ibiza, Spain: Activists from XR Ibiza and Futuro Vegetal enter Ibiza Airport, paint a private jet, and then glue themselves to it. The protest, part of the Make Them Pay campaign, closed the runway for several hours. 18 JULY | Trieste, Italy: Rebels are covered with fake oil to highlight how the regional government is funding the expansion of a transalpine oil pipeline to Austria that would connect to four additional methane plants. This commitment to fossil fuels comes despite the regional government promising net-zero emissions by 2045. 22 JULY | Rwanda, Nigeria, Tanzania: Hundreds of scientists, activists, and young people march through cities across Africa on Climate Emergency Day. Protesters held special Climate Clocks to demand their governments ‘Act In Time’ to end the Climate Emergency. Pictured are rallies in Kigali, Rwanda, Abuja, Nigeria, and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. 23 JULY | Budapest, Hungary: Rebels protest outside the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, home to the teams competing in the Formula 1 Hungarian Grand Prix. The F1 event costs the Hungarian government hundreds of millions of euros, while the race itself and related VIP services, such as helicopter taxis, burn huge amounts of fossil fuels. Photo: Alföldi Dániel István 24 JULY | Malmö, Sweden: A new climate group welcomes a special guest for their blockade of Malmö’s oil harbour. Throughout the summer, activists from Ta Tillbaka Framtiden (Take Back The Future) have blocked access roads to Sweden’s oil harbours. 19 - 29 JULY | Grangemouth, Scotland ‘This Is Rigged’ blockade the entrance to Grangemouth oil terminal. “It’s like Mordor,” said one activist. Climbing fences, occupying pipework, immobilising a car park of tanker trucks, even concreting themselves to roads, these are the lengths the new Scottish eco-group, This Is Rigged (TIR) was willing to go to shut down Grangemouth oil terminal. The terminal supplies 70% of Scotland’s fuel, and in two weeks of sustained action, TIR activists interspersed regular attacks on its infrastructure with cultural actions appealing to the Scottish identity. The group opened its campaign with 4 people targeting the Clydebank oil tunnel in Glasgow and 24 heading to Grangemouth itself. There, the second group split their forces, blocking gates, climbing and disabling tanker trucks, and locking on to things. Despite a strong police response, the atmosphere wasn’t hostile; on-site workers ambled over for a banter and showed interest in the activists' demands. More blockades of the terminal followed over the next two weeks, each building on the last; activists chained themselves to an old washing machine, locked on to tubes fed through buckets that were then cemented to the road, and glued themselves to the road with cinder blocks coated in fast-drying cement. Other activists took advantage of these roadblock diversions to scale a new 3-metre fence topped with barbed wire and enter the site. The disruption was significant. TIR paint their parliament red, scale a giant horse head, and deface a royal portrait. Meanwhile, there were the cultural actions: two activists risked their lives climbing one of The Kelpies, two 30-metre-high metal horse sculptures, stating “they would not be lured underwater” by the Scottish fossil fuel industry. A portrait of the British King in the National gallery was sprayed with “the people are mightier than a lord”. Four women sprayed the Scottish parliament with red paint. Founded last January, TIR has two main demands: First, the Scottish government must oppose all new fossil fuel projects in Scotland, and second, it must create a clear and fully-funded transition for Scottish oil and gas workers. TIR is particularly focussed on community and building solidarity with local groups. Besides a weekly soup kitchen, they hold regular workshops on Scotland's rich history of civil resistance. Integrating art, “pranktivism”, and attacks on infrastructure, they have been very busy so far, and belief is strong that they can win. My name is Cesar, I live in Pore, in the province of Casanare in the east of Colombia. I have been an activist since my early twenties, when I studied physics at the National University of Colombia. I realised that the future depends only on our actions - we cannot wait for governments to change anything. Now that I am 41 years old, I am just as rebellious and cannot conceive of any other way of life than climate activism! It is a sense of responsibility that motivates me, because I understand the climate crisis. I live it, I feel it, it is a reality that I cannot avoid. In this crisis, there are many victims who are unaware that they are victims, and there are many others who do not want to see or accept it. All the while, the powerful people in the world are either too immoral or irresponsible to act. In the absence of their action, I do my part. My daughter, my partner, and all my friends and family give me the strength and support to be able to do my part. Even though it is certainly not without risk. I even had to flee to Venezuela for a time to be safe from prosecution. But I always want to speak the truth, and continue defending nature, such as the La Morena natural reserve in San Luis de Palenque. This area is under threat from Anglo-French oil company Perenco wanting to extract oil and gas. Sinking their fangs like vampires into the earth to suck the life out of it, that is how I see it. It is a difficult struggle against such foreign interests, in particular because many here in Colombia have been deceived by the discourse of the “good works” of the Global North. Not just the “good” economic system and the “right” religion, but also the science of the Global North, which is an extractivist science. A science used to destroy ecosystems. This is why the collective that I started a few years ago is called Ciencia Local [Local Science]. We use the science inherited from our ancestors, those who survived the invasion into the lands of Abya Yala. With this wonderful rebel community, we are preserving natural lands and educating the population on the climate crisis. Currently, I am also working with people from all over the world to organise the Earth Social Conference which will take place in Pakistan in December. This conference will be an alternative to COP, because COP has not led to any action, and the young people of the world understand that they cannot leave our responsibility in the hands of the irresponsible.

(34 mins) An Extinction Rebellion co-founder delivers an intriguing analysis of where she sees the climate movement heading, and why politicians are so bizarrely incapable of stopping the world from burning. Human Rights Watch: Uganda: Oil Pipeline Project Impoverishes Thousands EACOP will devastate the planet once it is operational, but even under construction, the pipeline is devastating thousands of lives in Uganda. That is the conclusion of this report, detailing the shocking way Total Energies is cheating Ugandan farmers out of their land. iNews: Carbon Capture is a Disaster and Entirely Unworkable When the British Prime Minister flew to Scotland by private jet to announce that his government would max-out North Sea oil and gas extraction, he also announced a new carbon capture and storage project, which will apparently make it okay. Except it won’t. At all. Here, a professor in earth system science explains why. Adani Watch: Forgotten People: Conflicts in India Caused by Adani Group’s exploitation of Coal We’ve already seen examples of coal companies operating illegally in this issue, but few coal companies are as lawless or polluting as Adani. This report details how exploited communities in India have fought back, protesting against Adani’s coal mines, coal power stations, and coal ports to defend their lives and livelihoods.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/07/14/global-newsletter-78/,"An ‘Oil Slicker’ leads the march to an organisation that helped Big Oil conquer COP. Photo: Gareth Morris This issue: Big Oil vs COP | XR DRC Rebel Tour | Indigenous Protest in Argentina Dear rebel, In the same way that drug dealers shouldn’t run rehab centres, Big Oil executives shouldn’t run climate change negotiations. Except now, they do. COP, the UN summit where global representatives never quite manage to solve the climate crisis, will be held later this year in the United Arab Emirates, a petrostate with nearly the worst carbon emissions per capita in the world. Stranger than the choice of host nation is the choice of COP28’s President - the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The oil company isn’t just sharing its boss with COP - there’s mounting evidence that ADNOC is overseeing its entire operation. It has also announced plans to double oil and gas production by 2027. It’s the latest and most damning example of Big Oil’s capture of the UN climate negotiation process, and it can come as little surprise that the latest event in that process, the Bonn Climate Change Conference, resulted in yet more stalemates. Rebels hold a rally of art and performance to launch a campaign that will mobilise resistance to oil extraction in DRC. The UN has responded to the COP28 controversy by asking the (likely record amount of) oil lobbyists who are attending to identify themselves. But asking pickpockets to wear name-badges won’t stop you losing your wallet. Rebels had a more robust response. As climate negotiations were failing in Bonn, they visited the offices of IPIECA in London, an organisation that has represented Big Oil at every UN climate change meeting, is wholly funded by Big Oil, and is a key cog in the machine that has ground global action on climate change to a halt. You can find out more about this rebel visit, and how police spies tried to ruin it, in Action Highlights. There, you can also read about how rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo are building resistance against a new round of oil extraction, and how XR Hungary and XR Serbia synchronised protests against an oil pipeline between their two countries. XR Misiones supports the Indigenous protests in Jujuy, Argentina, where the state plans to seize land for lithium mining. Solidarity has been shown worldwide. Finally, Solidarity Corner returns to show support for our protesting comrades in Jujuby, Argentina, who are facing brutal police repression for standing up to corrupt laws designed to turn their ancestral lands into lithium mines. We live in a world where fossil fuel extraction is increasing, carbon emissions are rising, global temperatures are skyrocketing, and ecosystems are unravelling. Trusting Big Oil to put anything before their own profits is not just stupid - it’s enabling genocide. In its current guise, COP and the negotiations around it are not just corrupted, they are a criminal charade, and institutions like the IPIECA have been key in bringing about this depressing dystopia. This issue may feature the first rebel action targeting their offices, but you can be sure it’s not the last.

Give What You Can 12 JUNE | London, UK A rebel coalition including activists from Debt For Climate, Global Justice Now, and Debt Justice held a rally outside the offices of the IPIECA, the organisation used by Big Oil corporations to influence and ultimately sabotage COP climate negotiations. The rebels had planned to enter the IPIECA and deliver a letter, written by members of the US Congress and European Parliament, which calls on the leaders of the US, EU, and UN to limit oil companies’ influence over COP and replace the COP28 president, who is CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, a key member and funder of the IPIECA. But the police had infiltrated the rebels’ communication channels and warned the IPIECA. When the activists arrived, they found the building locked up and empty, with a guard at the door. The activist alliance chant outside the offices of the IPIECA. Undeterred, the rebels put on a disruptive display, calling out the IPIECA for its gross greenwashing, and demanding that COP28 be freed from Big Oil influence. There were stirring speeches and an imposing display by the XR Oil Slickers. The IPICEA (International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association) was set up in 1974 as the main link between the UN and the fossil fuel industry, and it has attended every UN climate change meeting ever held. With its diverse staff and job titles like ‘Climate Change Manager’, the organisation presents itself as a centre for sustainability and climate action. But the depressing truth is that it’s directed by former Big Oil executives, it’s 100% funded by Big Oil companies, and it’s helped Big Oil capture the COP process. Speeches + Oil Slickers + Drummers = Good times. 636 delegates at COP27 were lobbyists from the oil and gas industries, an increase of 25% over COP26, where fossil fuel lobbyists already outnumbered any national delegation. This year, COP28 is essentially being run by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. A recent study by One Earth calculated that Big Oil owes at least $209bn per year to communities most damaged by the extreme weather caused by their pollution (and exacerbated by their lies). Instead, Global South countries pay billions of dollars in debt repayments to the countries responsible for the climate emergency. Watch their video, then join the Get Big Oil Out of COP28 campaign. 1 - 23 JUNE | Moanda, Democratic Republic Congo Rebels launch the Pétrole Non Merci campaign at Kituku market in Goma, DRC Rebels across the DRC are uniting to say, “Pétrole Non Merci”! (Petrol No Thank You!) This national campaign was initiated by XR University of Goma, who have led efforts ranging from the mobilisation of local communities to the protection of the Virunga National Park via the Fossil Free Virunga campaign, and who have now travelled more than 6,000 km across the DRC to mobilise against the expansion of Big Oil. The Pétrole Non Merci campaign opposes the proposed sale of 27 oil blocks and 3 gas blocks, most of which overlap protected areas like Virunga Park, mangroves on the coast, and peat bogs in the Congo Basin. Anglo-French oil company Perenco recently bid to buy the new blocks and will export the oil using the EACOP pipeline. The rebel campaign is two-pronged. One part involves mobilising communities where the new oil blocks are located to build local power and hold officials accountable. Rebels are explaining the many disadvantages of the fossil fuel industry on these communities and how they can stand up for their rights using non-violent means. XR University of Goma travel 6,000 km to Moanda for the formation of XR Moanda. The second part involves linking up with communities like Moanda, on the west coast of the DRC, who have been exploited and abused by Perenco for decades. A Goma rebel who travelled there said, “the people of Moanda agreed to accompany us in this battle so that together we block the road to the fossil industries, starting with Perenco, which our political leaders try to falsely show as a positive example of oil exploitation.” So far, XR University of Goma have held exchanges that resulted in the formation of XR Rutshuru, XR Moanda, and XR Bunia. Along the way, they are organising public actions using art, music, and performance – such as the dazzling demonstration in the Kituku market of Goma which took place after the Kalehe flood in May. The travelling rebels plan to continue to take action throughout the DRC, with coordinated popular uprisings saying NO to the leaders who still want to defraud humanity for personal gain. Follow the Pétrole Non Merci campaign on Facebook and Instagram. 20 JUNE | Budapest, Hungary & Belgrade, Serbia Budapest: Rebels protest outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The signs say ‘MOL profits from the climate crisis’ and ‘Clean energy for Hungary!’. MOL is the Hungarian oil company building the pipeline. XR Hungary and XR Serbia came together to protest the planned construction of a new 128 km-long oil pipeline between the two countries. Presented officially as a mark of 'friendship' between the neighbouring nations, the Friendship pipeline would allow Serbia to circumvent EU sanctions on importing Russian oil. This move doesn’t just risk disapproval from the EU; a project of this magnitude will influence energy policy for decades to come, boosting the fossil fuel industry at a time when every country should be investing in alternatives. Meanwhile, the rebel groups, who met originally at a climate camp in Croatia, forged a truer friendship by conducting coordinated protests outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Budapest and the Ministry of Mining and Energy in Belgrade. Belgrade: The parallel protest in front of the Ministry of Mining and Energy, with a sign saying ‘Friendship for climate hell’. XR Hungary was founded in 2019 but suffered a sustained fall in activity after the pandemic. Recent actions have been focused on outreach and raising awareness amongst the Hungarian public, with the aim being to build on its small but dedicated community of rebels. The police were still so unfamiliar with the group that they struggled to copy the Extinction Rebellion name from the banner, but this is bound to change soon; a new, top-secret action is in the works for the very near future, so stay tuned for more news from Budapest! Follow XR Hungary on Facebook and XR Serbia on Facebook too! 4 JUNE | Canada/UK: Two rebels face deportation for peaceful protest. In the UK, a rebel is facing deportation to Germany after being sentenced to 2 years, 7 months for scaling a bridge as part of a Just Stop Oil protest. In Canada, a rebel faces deportation to Pakistan for his involvement in actions with XR and Save Old Growth. Find their petitions in the links above and sign them! 7 JUNE | Amazon, Peru: Indigenous activists use canoes, spears, and Molotov cocktails to capture two PetroTal oil tankers and kidnap 14 crew members. The clash came after local government annulled an agreement to use a cut of oil profits to fund social development in the area. The crew and vessels were unharmed and released a week later, after a meeting between the Indigenous activists and local authorities. 7 - 15 JUNE | Bonn, Germany: Activists at the Bonn Climate Conference drop a banner as the COP28 President (and Big Oil executive) arrives. A coalition including activists from Debt For Climate, Last Generation, Scientist Rebellion, and XR set up a climate-camp outside the conference during its final three days. MAPA activists spoke to the international press about debt cancellation, Loss & Damage, Degrowth, and how COP has been captured by the fossil fuel industry. 10 JUNE | Bologna, Italy: Hundreds of activists, including rebels, block a section of ring road to denounce the cementing-over of the region by local authorities. They turned the motorway into a space for art, music, and theatre, and called on their leaders to start a regional Citizens’ Assembly and to stop using public money to fund climate collapse. 11 JUNE | Rotterdam, Holland: 60 rebels and Scientist Rebellion activists delay the departure of a cruise ship from the Port of Rotterdam. They called on city authorities to ban all cruise ships. The average cruise produces twice the CO2 as a holiday by plane, and the shipping industry is yet to produce a roadmap to sustainability. 12 JUNE | Johannesburg, South Africa: Hundreds of activists, including rebels, rally outside the corporate HQ of Standard Bank during its AGM. A few made it inside, with one activist handing the CEO an award for human rights violations. Two more activists were forcibly evicted from the foyer. The South African bank supports the ecocidal oil pipeline EACOP as well as other fossil fuel projects across Africa. 14 JUNE | Dunedin, New Zealand: A 64-year-old woman who wrote a fake email telling delegates to a fossil fuel conference that it had been postponed could face up to 10 years in prison. She was found guilty of fraud and will be sentenced in September. 15 JUNE | Ecuador: Scientist Rebellion activists march with indigenous groups and community organisations who are demanding protections from the threat of mining. Marches were held all over Ecuador, which will hold elections in August. Presidential candidates were urged to free the country from mining. 18 - 23 JUNE | Australia: Blockade Australia activists simultaneously shut down three major coal ports, using tripods, monopoles, climbing gear, armlocks, and glue to repeatedly blockade the Newcastle Coal Port, the Port of Melbourne, and the Port of Brisbane. 8 activists were arrested and 3 were held in jail for a week. Find out more about their amazing campaign here. 27 JUNE | Kampala, Uganda: 22 students marched peacefully to the Ugandan parliament to deliver a petition calling on the government and Total Energy to drop EACOP. The students were blocked by the police, had their banners confiscated, and one was illegally detained. He reappeared 3 days later, having been tortured and brutalised by unknown attackers. In solidarity, 27 Just Stop Oil activists sat outside the London HQ of Total Energy in the UK. They were arrested and given (illegal) bail conditions banning them from any protest without prior police approval. 27 JUNE | New York, USA: Rebels joined a solidarity action for two Declare Emergency activists facing up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine after their peaceful protest at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Meanwhile, youth activists with the new group, Climate Defiance, shut down a fundraiser for a New York Senator who takes bribes to wave through oil pipelines. Climate Defiance is just three months old, but has already disrupted events held by 5 US Senators and 2 Presidential Advisors for their complicity in ecocide. 30 JUNE | Roskilde, Denmark: 45 rebel activists & scientists disrupt Roskilde airport, where private jet flights have quadrupled since 2020. Those on the runway were arrested and charged according to a repressive criminal law that could lead to 6 years in jail. Meanwhile, the super-rich enjoy their criminal luxury. 1 JULY | Lyon, France: Rebels occupy a local golf course to denounce the hoarding and waste of water by the richest for leisure activities while drought plagues the rest of the country. Protesters in Jujuy are brutalised by riot police, rubber bullets, and tear gas. Transitioning to greener technologies is a key part of overcoming the climate crisis, but this new technology is often produced using the same exploitative, racist, ecocidal systems of the fossil fuel era. Argentina holds a fifth of the world's lithium reserves, crucial for the batteries that will store the renewable energy of the future. Demand for the metal is skyrocketing, and most of it is found under the high-altitude wetlands of Jujuy, a largely indigenous province where most people don’t have legal title to their own land. Jujuy's regional government recently raced through constitutional “reforms” which legalised the appropriation of indigenous land for mining, as well as criminalising protest. In response, the people took to the streets, building roadblocks and occupying buildings. Solidarity vigils were held by rebel groups in cities across Argentina, including in Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata, and Tucumán. The state reacted with brutal, indiscriminate violence. Riot police used rubber bullets, tear gas, and beatings, injuring hundreds of people (including a 17-year-old boy who lost an eye) and arresting hundreds more. There are reports that the regional courts will issue excessive fines to match the region’s deficit from lost tourism, and imprison those who cannot pay. The protesters have inspired solidarity from rebels in Argentina, and activists across the world. According to a rebel spokesperson in the region, while environmental groups are supporting the protests, they are being led by the indigenous community. There are not enough police to clear the road blocks, and instead the state is trying to wear the protesters down. The protesters are tired, but their blockades still stand. They do not intend to back down until the “reforms” are repealed and the governor resigns. We salute them. Reflections on Earth Trusteeship proposes and explores a radical change in global governance—that law and policy be organised around the principle that the Earth is an entity and humans are its trustees, not its owners. The idea is not new, but rather than simply stating why trusteeship is a good idea, the authors explore the concept through legal, philosophical, and historical lenses, demonstrating that trusteeship is consistent with international law, already enjoys broad support in multiple countries, and is poised to have its historical moment. The authors are making their case in terms that extremely powerful people can be expected to understand and find legitimate. The scholarly, legalistic language does make the text a bit hard to read, and the organisational principle of the book is far from clear. At times, it seems like a collection of thematically related material, not a cohesive work. But Reflections is an ambitious book. If it can accomplish even a fraction of what it sets out to do, we will all be better off. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops. Buy your books at Bookshop or Hive. Read this rebel’s journey from Ugandan farm to XR Rwanda in ‘My Climate Story’. Guardian Podcast: The Oil Company CEO Running COP28 (26 mins) A Guardian journalist exposes how the United Arab Emirates were sharing a COP28 email server with the state oil company ADNOC, giving the oil company access to every email to and from the conference organising committee. The podcast also profiles ADNOC’s CEO, who is the COP28 President, and the mysterious army of fake social media accounts defending his hosting of the summit. XR Global Support Blog: My Climate Story A rebel in Rwanda, raised on a farm by his grandmother in Uganda, traces his journey to climate activism, including a moving account of how his childhood was plagued by death and hunger because of extreme weather. Novara Media Podcast: How To Blow Up The Box Office (59 mins) The co-screenwriter and producer of the recent eco-thriller film ‘How To Blow Up A Pipeline’, inspired by the book of the same name, discusses the various ethical issues around making art out of extreme activism, including how giving audiences the catharsis of climate action might reduce activism rather than encourage it. XR Global Support Blog: An Interview With Charles Curtin This American ecologist has worked with rural communities for many decades, and in this expansive interview, he reflects on how, as our world warms, indigenous knowledge, localised activism, and circular economies are the keys to the future. 23 - 27 AUGUST | Krk Island, Croatia XR Zagreb is happy to invite you to the 2nd Adriatic Climate Camp at Camp Bor on the island of Krk, Croatia, from 23rd to 27th August 2023!

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/06/30/charles-curtin-interview/,"Charles Curtin has made a career of thinking outside the box, of paying attention to the local and indigenous people government agencies and large conservation groups alike tend to ignore, of looking at big places and long time-scales without seeking an easier, simpler way out. He has a habit of issuing rather koan-ish one-liners, among them 'don’t be the kind of expert who talks; be the kind of expert who listens.' While there are obvious differences between what he does and what XR does, there are also parallels, particularly in his conviction that climate change is inherently a social justice issue. But while Extinction Rebellion is very much a newcomer, he’s been at it for some thirty years now. He’s seen what works—and what doesn’t. Charles is also my friend, though I hadn’t had an opportunity to see him in a while. When I asked if he’d be willing to offer us a few tips for going forward, I was glad he said yes. I have, with his permission, edited his words for length and clarity. A rural community in New Mexico with fire impacts looming. Photo provided by Charles Curtin Charles is an ecologist, a conservationist, and a writer. He specialises in finding ways for rural, often disenfranchised communities to protect their own land—he has been involved in projects that saved millions of acres (an acre is almost half a hectare, but either way, lots of land). His current work centres on his home in the Mora Valley, a remote Hispaño enclave in New Mexico, where he has formed an organisation called the Sangre de Cristo Mountain Initiative to address three regional crises at once: the land needs restoration after decades of mismanagement, but there is no money to pay for the work; there is little economic opportunity for young people, most of whom simply leave; and, of course, there is climate change. Charles and his colleagues are trying to launch a sustainable business venture meant to make habitat restoration economically viable while providing badly-needed jobs for local people and sequestering carbon. The project was just finding its legs when a monstrous wildfire ripped through the region, leaving behind a great deal of damage and a thin, but very real, chance to do a whole lot of unexpected good. I should make clear that although Charles speaks of Extinction Rebellion with respect, he is not himself a rebel. Nothing we do should be seen as reflecting on him, nor are his opinions necessarily those of XR. I initiate the Zoom call on a January afternoon and there he is, older but otherwise the same as ever, in an avocado-coloured fleece jacket, seated in what looks like a back hallway. Sunlight streams in from one door. Colourful, woven rugs adorn the walls. We spend some minutes discussing those rugs and getting reacquainted. Behind me, he can see my wood-stove, a framed wedding photo, and the lights of our Yule-tree reflected on the window-pane as the daylight fades to black outside. We are speaking across time-zones. Zoom is so strange, offering us these glimpses into each others’ places, each others’ lives, but only so far as the camera can see. Beyond that, nothing. He has been following XR in the news and remarks that 'they think deeper than the old Earth First! groups. They’re a generation beyond, thirty years later, and there’s more sophistication to how they’re conceptualising it.' Then he laughs a little self-consciously. He asks why I want to interview him. I tell him about that even though we’re a protest movement and he’s not, we have a lot in common. I give him a few examples. I mention our efforts to avoid Eurocentrism, knowing how he, a white and relatively privileged American, does the same. He interrupts me, commenting that a lot of environmental groups don’t want to get involved with forestry or anything related to it. 'And I’m like, well, wait a minute, we’ve got three hundred, four hundred years of culture here that was based on forestry, on sawing down trees and killing animals, whether you’re talking about the Pueblos or the Hispaño people. So do you judge, do you say, oh, I’m a vegan, I don’t believe in what those Pueblo people did for the last thousand years? Or do you have some sort of common ground?' He says he’s glad we’re grappling with this, that most environmental organisations are too urban and don’t pay enough attention to rural and indigenous peoples. On to the questions (in bold and italics). When Charles writes about environmental conservation, he’s usually not discussing scientific study design or natural history. Instead, he’s writing about how to work with people—and what goes wrong when conservationists fail to collaborate with various stakeholders. He has said 'it’s not about conserving the land—it’s about conserving the communities that conserve the land.' Well, XR isn’t organising land trusts, but our work certainly depends on collaboration. I started out with a couple of questions about the art of dealing with people. You’ve written about how environmental organisations and government agencies often try to help local communities but hurt them instead. How can XR, going forward, avoid falling into some of the traditional mistakes? 'Interesting,' he murmurs, looking away from the camera a moment to collect his words. 'Yeah, one of the first things, of course, is to address any situation you enter into with humility, right? To listen and look. Just listen, just watch what’s going on.' As he speaks, he talks with his hands, though not to excess. His face is impassive, professional, disclosing almost nothing of the personal—except interest or, not infrequently, a hint of secret irony. 'Years ago, we were doing these exchanges between [American] ranchers and the Maasai, and we really had to bite our lip, not say anything. We’d so often want to guide the conversation. That’s the hardest thing with a large organisation, you know—time is money, the clock is ticking, you want to get a lot of things done, and donors are impatient. But it’s almost a direct relationship, the more time you invest up-front, the more durable the outcomes are. A lot of it is simply be engaged. 'I really found I need to live in the communities I work in. As you know, I used to work with fishing communities off the coast of Maine, where the most important information I got was not a formal interview, but I’d be on the ferry in a storm, on the back deck, and the waves would be rolling by, and a fisherman would saunter up to me and say, you know, I’ve got an idea.' Quoting the fisherman, he speaks in character, becoming, for a moment, the weather-beaten worker he knew. 'Or—I have to laugh—in Montana, one time I closed the local bar [stayed until closing] five nights in a row—and I don’t really drink, but that’s the way you meet people, and after two or three beers, a rancher comes up to me and says you know, I’ve been thinkin’ about…. 'Or, at the moment, I’m one of the few what they call Anglos in a community of mostly Indigenous and Hispaño people. It’s about showing up, being accessible, and that just takes time. So, yeah, humility and patience is what a lot of it boils down to.' And he swivels in his chair a bit, patiently awaiting my next question. You’ve done a lot of work with ranchers [who tend to have an adversarial relationship with environmentalists] and others who disagree with you or each other about major things. How do you find common cause? 'Ok, well, the Blackfoot Challenge [an organisation] I worked with in Montana for a while, had a wonderful saying, the 80/20 rule. I found it remarkably accurate—most people agree on 80% of things. We love our children. We value our parents. So you really focus on the 80% you agree on, not the 20% you don’t. Now, how that plays out in terms of details may differ, but I’ve been amazed how, when you put politics aside, how things really change. 'A lot of the ranchers we work with tend to be conservative. I think, at one point, everyone I worked with was a strong Trump supporter. But we didn’t talk about Trump. We talked about, you know, what we cared about in the environment, why we wanted to change things, what we agreed upon. So that’s the main thing, focus on what you agree on, what you can do something about, not on what you don’t. 'I mean, one of my closest partners right now is a Trump supporter. I don’t need to prove him wrong or prove me right. He gets where I’m coming from, I get where he’s coming from, and the irony is his values are very similar to mine, they’re just expressed differently because he listens to different press, has a different context in which he views things, but the values are the same. So that’s the main thing, not to get into judgement, not dwelling on differences, looking for common ground. Years ago, we had a bunch of US State Department-supported projects in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians where, once again, you focus on the common ground. You care about the land, you care about your children, you care about your community—we don’t need to debate religion. It kinda works across the board.' Sounds easier said than done. How do you tell what is common ground versus what you maybe shouldn’t talk about? An amused shadow pulls at his face for a moment. Charles likes clever, surprising insights, simple ideas that are far from obvious and yet make all the difference in the world. Apparently, this thing about bridging differences qualifies. But he answers a slightly different question than the one I asked. 'The Blackfoot Challenge used to talk about pacing. There’s a timing to things. To give you an example, I was doing this joint project between Palestinians and Israelis and then American conservationists about ten or twelve years ago. At one point, some of us mentioned what seemed like a simple question about power dynamics or something, and all of a sudden it was like the flood-gates opened. These groups had been together for months, and they finally felt they were in a safe space to go to the next level and really talk about the gorilla in the room, which was their faith and the power relationships in the Middle East. 'Right now, I’m with my [business] partner who’s a Trump supporter—we can talk about it, we can agree to disagree, and so now, after several years, he might say something and I go, you know, I don’t really buy that and this is why, and he can say, well, I’ve heard this and this is why, So we can have that dialogue, but we don’t start out with that. So yeah, I think there’s a time and place, and it’s necessary, but you’re deepening the relationship. 'Again, to me, conservation is done by people, right? So ultimately it’s about building human relationships. And anything that disturbs human relationships, disturbs bonds, is not a good thing. And so it means being right about some political point is irrelevant. It’s a matter of thinking about what are those big needs out there? And recognize that if we’re collectively able to save a million acres, does it really matter if the guy next to me votes differently? Nah, it doesn’t.' I should point out that what Charles is saying here needs to be read with some nuance, as sometimes votes and political disagreements can matter very much—the point is that they don’t matter to those million acres. When a house is on fire, firefighters don’t stop to argue politics or moral philosophy, they work together to put the fire out. I comment that Charles is wise, and he glances away, chuckling, embarrassed. 'Well, it takes patience because you’re taught to, you know, get in there and stand up for yourself, but you gotta take the big picture, you know, what is your end goal? What are you after? And being right is not it. Everyone’s gotta give a little bit.' You, like XR, do a lot of work with communities that don’t have much support through normal government channels and big organisations. Can you speak to that process, to supporting communities coming together and building their own capacity? 'Yeah, no, it’s an interesting point,' he begins. 'One of the things you realise, is that—and I say this as a liberal, white, North American—a lot of government policies don’t really apply to rural communities. So I can see why communities get agitated, I can see why they gravitate towards…. I live in a community of 600 people. The schools are marginal at best. We have almost no healthcare. This is America’s outback. And you can understand why people are suspicious.' He looks down and fidgets with his hands a moment and frowns, bothered, before making eye contact with the camera again to speak. 'I wrote an article recently about people here in New Mexico—you know, we had these large fires here, with thousands of firefighters—but you have to understand the optics from the view of this village, this remote, Hispanic village. The last time the Feds [forces commanded by the Federal government] showed up in force, it was during the Pueblo Revolt in 1847 when the Seventh Cavalry shelled the place and burned it to the ground. And people have not forgotten that. I mean, that’s their experience of the Federal government. They are guys who steal children and bring them to language schools. They are people who shell communities. They’re the people who steal land. And so it’s a very different optic. So one of the reasons I like to live here is that, for North America, it’s probably closer to what other people experience in other parts of the globe. But again, it means people, if they’re gonna get empowered and get engaged, they’ve gotta do it themselves. 'And even though the politicos show up, and they do their dog-and-pony show, and they give, uh, refrigerators to poor people and various things, they don’t really get it. I guess where I’m going is that ultimately, empowerment is built locally. Even though I began my career in Washington DC doing policy at a Federal level, and yeah, there’s a lot you can accomplish that way, I more and more believe that almost all politics is local, almost all empowerment is local, so it’s about empowering local people and giving them a voice, recognizing that policy crafted at the Federal level, it’s a blunt instrument. It doesn’t deal with the nuances.' Residents of Mora Valley challenge state and federal actions as smoke from a nearby wildfire looms. Photo provided by Charles Curtin He talks at length about how the aid his neighbours are getting in the aftermath of the wildfires doesn’t actually meet their real needs because the aid program is based on an inappropriate, one-size-fits-all approach. He mentions that where he comes from, back in rural Wisconsin, was in some ways similar to the community he lives in now, though his family’s background was somewhat different. 'In general, if you’re dealing with rural communities, they’re all different, and they’re all kinda the same. 'Again, conservation is intrinsically a civil rights issue. It’s intrinsically a social justice issue, and that’s where it dove-tails, because if you’re not paying attention to the needs of other people, it’s not going to work, at least not sustainably.' The wildfire that Charles is talking about is the one I mentioned in the introduction—the Calf Canyon Fire, which was both the biggest, most destructive wildfire in New Mexico history and the largest wildfire of its year—2022—in the Continental United States. The fire burned a total of 138,188 hectares and was exactly the kind of disaster we can expect to see more of with climate change. It seems a good segue to a series of questions about an ecologist’s view of our changing climate. Was the fire a 'OK, climate change is personal now' moment for the people in your community? 'How interesting,' he says yet again, and sounds as if he means it, probably high praise from a scientist. He then refers to an Aldo Leopold quote about ecologists living in a world of wounds. He admits he can’t remember the rest, then adds 'the point was that people are blind.' Curiously, that’s not the point I’d draw from the quote, which is 'One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.' To me, the quote speaks to what it’s like to be an ecologist—but Charles has never been interested in talking about what it’s like to be him. That other people aren’t aware of the wounds, and why they aren’t aware, is far more important to him. 'I find it amazing that even in many rural communities like mine, where people are so tied to the land and have been for centuries, the lack of awareness of forest health and fire threat is stunning. For example, our forests are, on average, a hundred times historic densities because of over a century of fire suppression. The problem is most people in our area have never seen a healthy forest so they don’t understand how out of whack the whole system is…. 'So, with all the extra biomass on the land, wildfire was an accident waiting to happen. I was meeting with the county supervisors the day before the fire, and they said we don’t have an issue, and then the next day they had to evacuate. People sometimes think we’re inoculated now, and we’re not. What people don’t realise is that due to climate change, after seven years, the odds of having a reburn are just as great as if you hadn’t had a fire. We’ve got a very brief window to thin our forests and restore ecological health to avert another big fire—and yet at all levels of political leadership there’s a culture of denial and a focus on quick fixes rather than lasting solutions. So people from our political leaders on down do not get that it is not about repairing roads or fixing fences [after] last year’s fire. Hundreds of years of lifeway are at stake. Fire is the new reality no one is talking about. 'Cause the reality is for most rural communities, it’s kind of the beginning of the end when they have a major fire. Because the lifeways do change. They can’t raise their cattle, so people leave, they take buy-outs from outside investors, and so it’s really a struggle to make people aware of something that isn’t even on their radar. So a lot of my writing is about what’s really at stake here. Particularly to make the politicos realise that no, it’s not about giving people a bag of rice or hay for their cows, it’s much bigger than that! And it’s not just here in New Mexico but across the West—this is the new normal, this is permanent. Fire that transforms communities becomes more and more the norm, and how do we deal with that?' He smiles, suddenly self-conscious, and says he’ll stop there. He reaches for, and takes a drink from, what has to be the world’s largest and yellowest tea-cup. Or perhaps it is a soup-bowl. In either case, it sounds like he has just realised he’s been talking too much—but he hasn’t been talking too much. He has been speaking across a wide range of interrelated subjects without quite answering my question, or perhaps he has answered my question but also several other questions which I didn’t ask but which seem connected. What a healthy Southwestern forest looks like. Note the grassy understory and the widely-spaced trees of varying ages. Photo provided by Charles Curtin Charles speaks, when he’s not uttering pithy, Zen-ish one-liners, in first-draft essays, the sort of meandering thing that might prompt me, as an editor, to say tighten this up, focus on one point. Topic statement, supporting statements, boom, boom, boom! The really funny thing is the necessity of focus is something I learned from him. But nobody speaks in edited, polished essays, and anyway, sticking to a single, well-defined topic is exactly what his work doesn’t do. Because what topic do you stick to? Climate change? Fire ecology? Economic development? Human rights? No, you can’t, because they’re all interwoven. So he doesn’t. So the fire didn’t wake people up? 'I think it woke people up a little bit, but they really think well, that’s passed and now we’ll get back to normal life. But the reality is life hasn’t been as normal for decades, we just got lucky—until eight months ago. 'But another way to put it is there’s opportunity, right? We had a very sick forest, as I said, a hundred times the historical stand density, an ecological wasteland with a fraction of the biodiversity that should be here—dense, dense overstory, nothing in the understory, like a dead-zone for wildlife, when historically our forests were grasslands, rich, luxurious grasslands with trees sticking up here and there. Savannas with trees. And so we’ve got a reset, we’ve got an opportunity now to get back to where our landscape was a century ago. But the other thing is that we have evidence that in another century or so, we’re not going to have forests like we have now, they’re not going to regrow, it’s getting too hot and dry for them. We’re seeing tree die-offs already. So how can we design that future—we can plant trees that are more drought tolerant, we can change our way of thinking, because we’re not going back to where we were, that’s not going to happen.' Charles explains how, because of various unusual circumstances, there happens to be a lot of Federal funding available for recovery in this case. His proposed project predates the fire, but if re-framed and adapted to include salvaging dead wood, it may be able to receive a good chunk of that recovery money and use it to scale up. 'So there’s a lot of opportunity there, the question is are people going to take advantage of that? So a lot of my conservation work has been trying to re-think—we’ve been trying to do large landscape restoration for years, and we’ve been fighting for a few dollars here and there. Now we’ve got millions of dollars flowing into this landscape—can we harness it, can we use it wisely, or will we just return to the status quo? Not many people get that, even in this very savvy community. They’re still looking at what they lost, not where the opportunity is. Because the fire would have happened sooner or later anyway.' I remember the importance of forest-thinning in the American Southwest, in Arizona. I spent a few months on a saw crew doing fuels-reduction 20 years ago, and I remember our supervisors explaining why we were doing the work, how decades of fire-suppression had left the pine forests so thick that the trees themselves were stunted, 80-year-old pines just a few inches in diameter, and nothing at all able to grow beneath them. I’d seen, too, what happened when these places burned—there was a dead forest on a hill outside of town, nothing but blacked trunks, from a fire two decades earlier. The fire had burned so hot it sterilised the soil. And I remember the day the smoke came over from fires hundreds of miles to our west but still thick enough to redden and blot out the sun. Chainsaw in hand, I looked up, thinking proudly, that is what we are working now to prevent. This forest is dead, but when alive it was deeply unhealthy. Note how close together the trees are, a normal condition in many parts of North America but not in the Southwest, where animals aren't adapted to it. Photo provided by Charles Curtin But we weren’t really making much difference. We were a few dozen young people paid in pocket-change by charities and government programs interested in helping us build character. Unless somebody found a way to create a paying market for the stunted poles we cut, there would be no way to scale up the work. It seemed then a mere day-dream that anybody ever would figure it out. Except I’m thinking now that Charles and his colleagues have. Not wanting to embarrass him again, I don’t say that. Instead I tell him about how, shortly after I left that job, one of the patches we thinned happened to be between an approaching wildfire and a small city—and the fire reached the thinned area and stopped. But Charles tells me that thinned areas don’t stop fires anymore, because of climate change. Thinned areas do burn cooler, so the soil doesn’t cook and recovery is much faster, but in the drier, hotter conditions that are more common now, nothing stops the fires. In high winds, spot fires can spring up miles away. 'It’s a different world.' How is climate change impacting your home area? Again, he comments 'oh, interesting,' before he explains that, unlike some areas farther north, his region isn’t predicted to get less rainfall than it’s been getting, but warming temperatures mean the growing season is about two months longer, now. The longer warm season means the land dries out more, even if the amount of precipitation doesn’t change, what he calls functional drought. Drier land burns more easily, to the point that, across much of the region, the fire season now goes year-round, straining firefighting capacity badly. Meanwhile, as temperatures increase, plants and animals that live in the region’s mountains are already moving upslope, chasing the cooler climate they need. Eventually, they will run out of slope to go up. Some, like pikas—small, hamster-like relatives of rabbits—may go extinct. But, once again, Charles says he’d rather focus on the positive. He says that since the fire, he’s been noticing streams that barely ran before now full of water. 'The rule of thumb, and this is very coarse, is that your average tree uses a hundred gallons of water a day. So multiply that by, I don’t know how many million trees, at a hundred times the [forest] density that historically existed, and that’s another functional drought factor. So by burning the land, we have a lot more water. So all the agriculture areas downstream, the trout streams, if they can avoid being silted up and destroyed by runoff—and that’s a big if—that can help mitigate the effects of climate change. So the fire’s not all ""bad.""' He makes air-quotes with his fingers. What is the difference between not all bad and not all 'bad'? Charles rarely says or does anything without thinking about it, so those air-quotes must mean something, and anyway his eyes are twinkling again. I'll have to think about this. In any case, in drawing attention to helpful consequences of the fire, he's not denying its tragedy—or that of climate change more generally. But tragedy and pain get few people moving, and Charles wants action. So maybe in returning to the positive again and again through this interview, he means to offer reasons for engagement, for courage, for hope. How are these changes impacting people in your area? 'People are aware now of climate change in a way they weren’t a few years ago. People talk about it.' He speculates that maybe they talk about it too much, given that they now refer to any unusually dry patch of weather as climate change. The region is in a long-term drought that is distinct from climate change and will presumably end at some point. 'But people are definitely aware. They can’t irrigate as easily, so in a lot of areas people just don’t try to grow crops where they historically did. So that’s definitely changing the nature of the communities here. New Mexico has these Acequias (ditch-irrigation systems brought to the New World by the Spanish—who in turn picked it up from the Moors), we have about seventy ditches all over the valley, and the ditches that have been here for hundreds of years are drying up. People are more and more aware. They’re not getting the hard freezes, so insects are worse. They’re not seeing the snow they used to. So it’s definitely in the collective consciousness.' He spends some time explaining how the drought, plus a climate change-related shift in the timing of precipitation, from mostly in the summer to mostly in the winter, has been causing the desert he lives in to shift from a grassy to a more shrubby composition. His post-doc research was very much related to that shift, and he happily segues into discussing his earlier work. 'I ended up going from working on climate change [that is, studying it] to realising I could stand there and watch it or I could do something about it. We got to all sorts of creative and unusual partnerships. For example, turned out that while livestock can be quite damaging to the land, if you graze livestock in a way that emulates how bison used to graze, you can actually mitigate climate change.' The mechanism that he uncovered was that cattle would preferentially eat the shrubs, returning the land to its grassy, pre-climate-change state. 'Of course, there’s wise stewardship involved, right? You have to think about how you do it, you don’t just throw cattle out there. But that’s a great example of how, with climate change, you get these strange—not bedfellows, strange collaborations. So I got into collaborating with ranchers who are, as we’ve said, mostly conservative. A decade earlier, they would have chased me off their land at gun-point. But they realised the landscape was changing, we realised the landscape was changing, and we had to partner together to make a difference. And that means withholding judgement. I was very anti-grazing. I was—' And he makes a strange face, as though disturbed by his former self. 'Anti-a lot of things, and yet, I had to look and see, and oh, look, this land actually looks better under climate change, under certain grazing conditions. So again, that means you listen, you talk to people. What is it you did? What are you thinking about this? To me, as a scientist, often it’s a matter of taking that indigenous knowledge, that wealth of experience people have, and translating it into data, studying it, you don’t just take their word for it, you investigate it and apply it. 'So again, that’s maybe a big lesson that increasingly with climate change, a lot of these cultural practices are getting more important, whether it be indigenous ways of dealing with fire, indigenous ways of grazing, the way people steward the wildlife all these issues are getting more and important as we have less and less free-board [margin for error] in our systems.' Together, we tangent off into the definition of the word 'healthy' and the relevance of values to the scientific process, and how important it is to be honest about what one’s values are, instead of claiming a degree of objectivity that real human beings don’t have. It’s an interesting discussion, but we’re really getting off-topic. Time to wrap up. No set of questions, no matter how well-planned, can ever cover everything that I really want to hear—for one thing, there are usually things I don't even realise the interviewee knows. So my last question is always very open-ended. His answer is almost as long as the whole interview prior. Is there anything I should have asked about but didn’t? Charles leans back, swivels around in his chair, thinking. Then he leans forward, closer to the camera, very seriously, to explain. 'How does a group like Extinction Rebellion expand and sustain themselves in a world of diminishing resources? Diminishing economic resources, diminishing societal resources? It’s hard because we’ve got this zero-sum game with more and more groups chasing fewer and fewer funds. And so, Extinction Rebellion comes along, or whatever the newest group is, if it’s just a matter of out-competing the next guy, what have we really accomplished? 'So, maybe one group is better than another in some way…. But I ask you to think more about, not how do you defend your own turf, but how do you raise all boats? That means collaborating across groups, that means finding innovative ways to fund things, whether it be partnerships with farmers, partnerships with indigenous peoples, alternative valuation systems, carbon credits, what have you. But to me, the future of conservation really relies on doing something very different than what we’ve been doing. I see the big barriers as being economic not ecological—and that’s a lot to swallow for this ecologist! 'I mean, a lot of conservation is, let’s face it, ecological imperialism. It’s wealthy elites spreading their version of reality on other people, very judgmental about it, but it’s also, within that, these groups, fighting for funds, for limited, declining funds.' He presses his fists together, illustrating the conflict. 'So how do we break that cycle? This, as I said, is ultimately the future of conservation. 'By the way, keep in mind, we’ve been in a weird period, right? Professional scientists have only existed for a hundred years. Professional naturalists, only a hundred years.' By professional he means people earning their living that way. There were certainly scientists and naturalists more than a hundred years ago, but the vast majority of them were independently wealthy. Most of the others made their living by doing something other than scientific research. There wasn’t any money in science as such. 'Fire is the gift that keeps on giving,' said Charles of the destructive floods that began the rainy season after the fire. These floods are likely to keep recurring for several years. Photo provided by Charles Curtin 'These things we do to support what we do as conservationists, they’re very new and fleeting endeavours. We’ve had a very wealthy, very affluent society that allows people to be conservationists, that allows people to be scientists—and guilty as charged on both counts. Before that, it was only the elites, it was the wealthy, who went to Africa and decided oh, we’re going to make a park here, remove those people.' He goes into character again and dismisses the natives with an imperiously lazy hand-wave. 'In the four or five-hundred-year history of conservation, maybe for a hundred years we’ve had the wealth for people to do it professionally? If we’re going to survive, we’ve got to do it differently, and what does that look like? It means thinking—not about resilience, how we go back and recapture what we had, but this term I like to use, prosilience, being forward-thinking, forward-dynamic. The dollar-driven world of conservation, it’s—follow the trend-lines, it’s nearing an end. And groups are going to have to be really creative about how they do their work, and how they partner, and how they create value. And that means really re-thinking how we do conservation, not just what’s in our hearts but in our heads, what’s going on in the six inches between our ears, reconceptualising our role. 'So, it’s tough. We’ve been in a period of immense privilege, of immense resources—not likely to continue. So how do we move forward? Cause we need conservation now more than ever. But it’s not going to look like our grandfathers’ conservation, or our fathers’. It’s gonna be a different animal. And what does that look like? That’s the challenge. Cause we can’t just do what other groups have done but try to do it better, because that’s not sustainable.' He has been speaking very seriously, very plainly, with a quiet but certain confidence—but then he laughs, suddenly self-conscious, and adds 'At least not in my humble opinion.' I agree, acknowledging that while XR isn’t exactly a conservation group in the same sense, we do rely on donations of not only money but time and labour. A lot of us are volunteers. This is familiar territory for him. 'It’s hard. It’s an equity issue, like how much can you ask of people? Like, I work in conservation, you know, there’s a significant—you make a lot of sacrifices in this profession. In the end there’s the privilege of looking yourself in the mirror and knowing you did as much as you could, and that’s phenomenal. Not many people get to say that. But you also can’t ask people to not eat, not have children, and we’re not that far from that reality. It’s hard to sustain this work without thinking about….I’ve noticed, in my career, there’s been a marked decline in resources.' He talks at length about ebbing of financial resources of all conservation groups, how even the most successful have lost 40% of their staff in the last few years alone. There is a shift, too, across the board, away from seasoned, experienced staff, towards younger people who cost less to employ. 'Where is that expertise going? Where is that guy or gal with twenty years of experience and deep craft going? I don’t know. I don’t know where they went. They’re just gone.' Half a smile quirks his mouth, briefly. He explains that it’s taken him thirty years to understand these systems as well as he does, and he hopes to have another thirty years to use what he’s learned. So the whole idea of funding someone for eight years and then replacing them when they get expensive to employ is a real problem. 'When I began this work, I never thought—I thought it was going to be about ecology and community, but more and more it boils down to creative finance. How are we going to sustain these groups so they’ll be around for the next century, when they’re most needed? So I encourage people to really think through these issues. For example, carbon credits, if there are ways to have surcharges, if there are ways to...there are all kinds of innovative ways to fund this work. But people have to be willing to think about those creative solutions.' We discuss the reasons for the ebb, and he cites the cultural shift away from philanthropy on the part of the wealthy, the erosion of the middle class, and the loss of affluence generally--what he doesn't say is that this loss is itself a symptom of environmental degradation, a sign that the wealth realised by liquidating our planet's resources may be starting to run out. He doesn't say it, but why else would he keep emphasising that the latter half of the twentieth century was more affluent than the world will likely ever be again? He talks about his daughter, who is in her thirties, 'giving herself to conservation, to something larger than herself. She doesn’t really expect to have a home. People of her generation don’t plan on having a home, a Labrador, and 2.4 kids, they don’t see that as being open to them.' He says this with the same interested, engaged, but almost impersonal manner as the rest of his comments. The sunlight through the door behind him has gone diffuse, is fading. 'But again it’s not necessarily bad. The money was never free—philanthropists have agendas. Again, coming back to community empowerment, if a community can create a biomass energy plant, the energy plant takes the excess trees, creates carbon credits, creates biochar, the biochar goes to improve local farms and the soil and the ecosystem, the by-product of electricity goes to support local people in a way that’s off the grid, you’re creating a whole alternative economy that empowers the local people and gets them away from the constraints that they face.' This hypothetical, of course, is exactly what he and his partners are trying to achieve. 'I don’t mean to say it’s doom and gloom. We’re being forced to do something different, and that’s great. If we can create an abundant supply of energy that thins our forests, improves our watersheds, and empowers local people, what could be better? You’ll have a remote little community in New Mexico selling carbon credits, selling electricity back to the grid, thinning their own forests, using the money to set up educational programs so that kids who don’t want to go work at a call centre or in Silicon Valley can stay home and do logging or stay and do farming, the water goes into organic agriculture, and you create a circular economy—and that circular economy, to me is the future. But it ain’t what we’ve been doing!' I giggle over his jaunty delivery of that last line. 'Fun stuff,' he adds, acknowledging my giggle, and shifts a bit in his chair before leaning forward again. 'I encourage you to look up circular economy on the Capital Institute’s website and the work of Regensis, the Regen Network and Carbonface. There are a number of groups doing really neat, really innovative work. The exciting thing will be when groups like Extinction Rebellion meet groups like the Regen Network and groups doing circular economy work come together—and they will, cause they’ll have to—THEN you’ve got some really cool stuff.' It’s obviously his intended last line. It’s a good line. We grin, pleased with ourselves, and chat briefly about other matters. The light is almost gone now from the doorway behind him.

If carbon emissions continue at their current rate, a child born today will live on a planet where between a third and a half of the global population cannot flourish because of extreme temperatures. We’re already getting glimpses of this nightmare future - a world where Indian construction workers feel like they work in ovens, where wildfires rage right across Canada and force Americans indoors to stare at orange skies. With the recent arrival of El Niño, a global weather pattern that will further heat the planet, these glimpses can only worsen. Mothers and children rally in New Delhi, India for the global Mothers Rebellion.* But rebel mothers in 62 cities across the world refused to look away. They occupied public spaces, they shared their fears about the unfolding horror, and they promised to do everything they could to protect all children from it.

Give What You Can 13 MAY | India, Uganda, DRC, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Nigeria, South Africa, Costa Rica, Mexico, Argentina, USA, Australia, Germany, UK, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Poland, Spain, Portugal The mothers of the world won’t look away, they refuse to give up, and they will do everything they can to get climate justice for their children. That was the message delivered by rebel mothers in 62 cities across 20 countries the day before much of the world celebrated Mother’s Day. They sat in outward-facing circles in public spaces, holding signs with the names of their children, and were joined by grandmothers, aunties, nieces, sisters, children, and other allies. Each circle was different—some quiet and contemplative, some including dance and song, others holding climate story-times for children or pram parades! Rebel mothers and their allies unite in (clockwise from top left) London, UK, Ludhiana, India, Kampala, Uganda, and Lusaka, Zambia. The global wave of actions was organised by Mothers* Rebellion, the * signifying inclusivity for mothers, other caregivers, and their allies. The campaign harnessed all their power to highlight how the climate crisis is a child rights issue, and how those least responsible for the crisis will be the most impacted. A rebel mother in Australia said, “Women have always used their position as mothers to influence society. Mother’s Day began as an anti-war movement."" Another in Uganda added, “We are here to remind people that they can and must respond to climate change now, and that every person has to fight it, not just politicians.” A father in India saluted the mothers taking part for “spreading awareness to save Mother Earth and providing a healthy environment for upcoming generations!” A circle in Malmö, Sweden, where the rebel mother movement first began. Mothers* Rebellion was founded in 2022 by members of XR Los Angeles. They joined forces with rebel mums in Sweden who had already started organising locally - more than 3,000 mothers have since sat in circles in 20 Swedish cities. Earlier this year, women in Germany, Sweden, the US, Uganda and Zambia got together to start planning this debut global Mothers' Rebellion. After such a broad and brilliant campaign, plans are already underway for the next one.

Holding banners, placards and loudspeakers, more than 100 activists gathered outside Bangladesh’s National Press Club to condemn world governments for their continuing extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Rebels from the recently re-formed XR Bangladesh joined local members of Fridays for Future and YouthNet for Climate Justice to demand real action from the G7 nations, whose leaders were meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, for their annual summit. The activist alliance formed a human-chain around the press club, with some wearing oxygen masks to highlight the horrendous air pollution created by fossil fuels. Dhaka has been ranked one of the most air-polluted cities in the world, and Bangladesh one of the most polluted countries, thanks in large part to the continued use of coal and huge emissions from road traffic and construction. Other activists spelled out ‘Don’t Gas Asia’ in giant letters to highlight how Asian nations, including Bangladesh, import ever more Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). The Police did not intervene, and there were no arrests. An activist wearing an oxygen mask demands renewable energy in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the most at-risk countries in the world from the consequences of climate breakdown, with an impoverished population left at even greater risk by centuries of colonial capitalism and exploitation by the West. The protestors sent a clear message that Bangladesh’s government – and, even more so, the world’s rich nations – must immediately begin a just transition towards clean, renewable energy. XR Bangladesh and YouthNet are continuing to expand their activist alliance, recently welcoming groups dedicated to trans rights and disability justice. They are also educating people – particularly young people – about the climate crisis, and how both scientific information and indigenous knowledge should fuel climate action. Follow XR Bangladesh on Twitter and Instagram. 27 MAY | The Hague, Netherlands More than 1500 rebels were arrested, some violently, during a peaceful motorway blockade in The Hague. The action set a new record for arrests in the city (and probably any city), and seemed to completely overwhelm the Dutch authorities. “Our justice system is flooded and many in the judiciary are saying they don’t have the capacity (to prosecute). And also it’s pointless,” said a rebel overseeing the action. Thousands turned out to blockade the A12 motorway that runs through The Hague. Announced months in advance, the blockade attracted more than 6000 people, including support from 125 NGOs, 100 Scientists from Scientist Rebellion, and an orchestra of 80 musicians playing Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony. They were met with aggressive police tactics. Water cannons were deployed after only 15 minutes, but the rebels were not deterred. While most of those arrested were brought to a nearby football stadium and released almost immediately, around 40 remained in police custody for the whole day without food or water. They were held in tiny cells inside a police bus, where they were aggressively interrogated. One rebel was accused of biting a police officer and held for three days, but there was no proof of any violence, and they were fully acquitted a week later. The A12 Orchestra kept the blockade civilised, despite police violence. Photo: James Petermeier. This is the seventh time XR has blockaded the same motorway, the A12, to demand that the government stop subsiding the fossil fuel industry. When police preemptively arrested rebels in their homes before a similar A12 blockade in January, it caused a national outcry and an outpouring of support from civil society groups. XR Netherlands has been growing ever since, and action trainings are packed with new recruits. Our rebel source made clear though that they are not just fighting for their own future; “We are fighting for people right now who are getting hurt in terrible ways. 43,000 people died from drought in Somalia last year.” “Your country might be very different (when it comes to risking arrest), so we just want to encourage everyone to do what they can wherever they are.” Follow the A12 Blockade campaign on Facebook and Twitter. 25 - 27 MAY | Melbourne/Naarm, Australia The Australian government has an array of eco-experts at its disposal - from the Indigenous people who have sustained the land for millennia to the scientists who have spent decades patiently sounding the climate alarm. But they choose not to listen. So, XR Victoria organised a three-day occupation of central Melbourne (the Indigenous name of which is Naarm). A base camp was erected in the gardens near Victoria's Parliament House, which staged workshops, talks, a much-needed kitchen, and was also the starting point for a stream of actions. Miss Beehave (background) and XR Sybils (sybils were women believed to possess prophetic powers in Ancient Greece) take part in the Slow March. The trickle started with a combined rebel action involving Scientist Rebellion, Move Beyond Coal and School Strike 4 Climate, with the activists bringing scientific evidence to the National Australia Bank and demanding an end to fossil fuel funding. The next day was National Sorry Day, when Australians remember the mistreatment of Indigenous children who were forcibly “assimilated” into white Australian culture. In respect, rebels held back from disruptive actions until the evening, when a pop-up protest articulated their vision for a better world, hundreds of cyclists flooded the streets for a slow mass bike ride, and an Oz Rock Block party shook the tarmac. A ghost bike commemorating dead cyclists was installed during the slow bike ride. A flotilla of canoes on the Yarra river (Indigenous name, Birrarung) and a very slow march through the city centre were the highlights of the final day, with the latter action causing over two and a half hours of disruption. Blinky the giant burnt koala, Miss Beehave the giant bee, the XR Sybils, and the Red Brigade were all in attendance, as were hundreds of rebels and supporters. To those annoyed by the delays to their commute, and against the disruptive tactics, XR Victoria had this to say; “At least we are doing something. If you have better ways to get the urgent change we need, we are happy to hear them."" Follow XR Victoria on Facebook. 15 MAY | London, UK: 24 rebels protest outside a court after a judge prevented climate activists on trial for disruption from referring to climate change in their defence. When a lone rebel protested the ruling outside the court, the judge ordered her arrest. In solidarity, the rebel group, including an Olympic gold medallist, a priest, and a retired police sergeant, repeated the protest. The judge has called for them to be prosecuted. In more bizarre UK court news, two rebel drummers were accused of causing £28k of damage to oil company Schlumberger after they banged the metal shutters of one of its buildings with… their wooden drumsticks. They were later cleared. 20 MAY | Ecuador: Members of Scientist Rebellion paste scientific papers onto the offices of the national oil company PetroEcuador. They also condemned Spanish oil company Repsol for spilling 11,900 barrels off the Peruvian coast, and paid tribute to an indigenous activist who fought to protect the Ecuadorian Amazon jungle from PetroEcuador and was assassinated by hitmen in February. 21 MAY | Rome, Italy: Last Generation activists dye the Trevi Fountain black as they demand an immediate end to fossil fuels subsidies. The action took place after floods in the north of the country killed 14 and displaced 36,000 people. 22 MAY | Pwani, Tanzania: Rebels commemorate Biodiversity Day by planting fruit trees with local communities and farmers in the coastal Pwani region. 23 MAY | Geneva, Switzerland: Activists from a multinational alliance of groups including XR, Stay Grounded, Scientist Rebellion and Greenpeace infiltrate EBACE, the biggest private jet sales expo in Europe! Some activists were pepper-sprayed and injured by police as they chained themselves to the jets. After more than 24 hours, 102 climate activists were released from police custody. Stay Grounded have already launched a new campaign against private jets. 24 MAY | Germany: After nationwide police raids on the homes of Letzte Generation (Last Generation) coordinators, and the shutting down of their website, solidarity marches were launched across the country, with many thousands taking part. 25 MAY | Bilbao, Spain: A rebel and D4C activist from Indonesia confronts a World Bank representative at Innovate4Climate, the institution’s annual conference on climate finance, carbon markets and investment (aka greenwashing). The activist recently made this moving video about his continually flooded local neighbourhood in Makassar. 26 MAY | Paris, France: An alliance of activists from Scientist Rebellion, Greenpeace, Attac France, XR, and many more blockaded the annual shareholder meeting of fossil fuel giant Total. Police reacted violently, first blockading then beating and firing tear-gas at the peaceful protesters. 25 - 27 MAY | Gothenburg, Sweden: Rebels targeted the port and the politicians of Gothenburg during a three-day uprising. The coastal city’s port is a major hub for oil imports and oil refineries. Rebels occupied the City Hall reception, disrupted council meetings, blockaded the port itself, and the surrounding sea using kayaks. Two rebels managed to hang a 20 m banner from a giant new bridge linking the city to an island. 1 JUNE | Goma, DRC: Rebels mobilised in Kituku market and displayed artworks condemning fossil fuel exploitation in the region. Anglo-French oil company, Perenco recently bought 27 new oil blocks by Lake Albert and will export the oil using the EACOP pipeline. The east of DRC has been plunged into crisis by a series of landslides and severe floods in May. More than 500 have been killed and many more displaced. 2 JUNE | Merthyr Tydfil, Wales: After witnessing weeks of illegal mining at the Ffos-y-Fran coal mine in South Wales, XR Cymru and friends blockaded it and forced it to close for the day. They demanded that the owners restore the land as promised, and help their workers get future-proof jobs. Rebels hold a die-in outside the UK Parliament in London during The Big One. It’s been just over a month since 60,000 people gathered in London for XR UK’s Big One. Despite being potentially the biggest climate demonstration in UK history, you might well have missed it. The press coverage was virtually non-existent, and the event produced no noticeable change: The British government remains hell-bent on ecocide, its legislation increasingly draconian, its litany of scandals unrelenting. Despite this silence — or, indeed, because of it — April 2023 could go down in history as a crucial moment for the UK climate movement. And one month on, XR UK’s big strategy reveal shows why. XR’s large-scale London actions have always left behind contested narratives. Whether it’s the miracle of April 2019’s breakthrough, the missteps of October 2019, or the varied post-pandemic efforts at revival: Picking apart the movement’s highs and lows is a pastime relished by many insiders and no shortage of observers…. Read the rest of this article by heading over to Waging Nonviolence, a non-profit media platform providing reporting on and analysis of social movements. Sima, with her hand glued to a boat, during a blockade in Gothenburg. My name is Sima, and I am a rebel with a local XR group in Lund, in the south of Sweden. Before I became active in the climate movement, I was mainly interested in social and political issues. That is because of my background as a political activist in Iran, where I was born. After eight years of doing activism in Iran, I had to flee unjust persecution, which is when I came to Sweden. In Sweden, I became a biologist and also got a PhD at the medical department of Lund University. After some years, I started working with Doctors Without Borders, which gave me the chance to work all around the world and make connections with all kinds of people. It is these human connections that make me determined to act for a more just world. When I saw social issues worsening due to the escalation of the climate crisis, I decided to become a climate activist. It is clear to me that this climate crisis is caused by the capitalist system. Given the social injustices that have been embedded in the system since colonialism, and knowing the people whom this system works against, I could not accept just demonstrating. I wanted to take more radical action. That is why I was drawn to the civil disobedience methods of XR. I do not worry about the consequences of taking part in civil disobedience actions because whatever happens, I have gone through worse in Iran. Of course, it is terrible that more and more peaceful activists here in Europe are facing persecution. But it is a very small price to pay given what is at stake for humanity if we don’t act. Now that I am retired, I also feel that I am in a particularly privileged position. I have a stable source of income, my children are all grown up, and I have a lot of free time. So, I see it as my duty to take advantage of this privilege and take action. As an older person I also see it as my responsibility to the younger generations to secure a safe future, and in many places, a safe present for them. I will always work on integrating social issues and climate issues in my activism. We will not be able to tackle the climate crisis without working on social issues too, especially now that so many democratic rights are being taken away in so many countries. I really plead for broad collaborations and think XR should actively get involved with organisations that work on social issues. Society is complex and there are so many issues to be tackled and so many strategies to do it, no person or organisation can do that by themselves. We have to unite and work together.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/05/21/my-climate-story-rwanda-uganda/,"My name is David Jesero. I am from Uganda but based in Rwanda. In 2018, I joined the climate movement, organising first with Extinction Rebellion. In 2021, I also joined Climate Reality Leadership Corps, an initiative that includes training local leaders about climate change so that they can then educate others in their community. Founded by former US vice president Al Gore, I was trained by him online. The following year, 2022, I added two more movements: Scientist Rebellion, followed by Debt for Climate. The year after attending online classes taught by former US vice president Al Gore, I met him in person November 2022 at COP27 in Egypt, at a reception he organized for all the trainees at Sultan Garden Hotel, Sinai Governorate, Red Sea. Photo by Fidele Uwihoreye, Climate Reality Leader, Rwanda. This story, beginning in Mawundwe village in central Uganda, traces and summarises my climate journey across key moments of my life, recollecting and sharing inerasable climate realities that have greatly shaped and influenced my involvement with the climate movement. On the other side, the story shows how my inquisitive approach toward farming helped me solve the pesticide puzzle, save my harvest, and protect nature, all by using hitherto unthought-of natural formulas to treat crops. What's more, solving this challenge redefined my interaction with nature, leading me to become a caring, nurturing protector and steward. The story features my grandmother, a climate hero, a special friend, and brave woman who looked after me during my first encounters in what I only recognize today as being climate change. I will always be deeply indebted to her. January, February, and March are usually busy months, as they were in 1984 when I was six years old. At 6am, the disturbing noise of farmers sharpening their hoes told every other farmer that if they were still in bed, they must be in the wrong place. Still, this didn’t prevent Grandma and me from starting our day at 7:30am. Work would normally begin after preparing our modest breakfast: boiled water infused with crushed sugarcanes, served with fire-preserved leftover sweet potatoes. I don’t remember anything that could possibly distract me from focusing my attention on Grandma as she presented this seemingly heaven-sent breakfast for us. From April to May, farmers tended their fields and gardens, some fixing scarecrows to protect their crops from birds, others staying in their fields themselves in order to reduce the risk of thieves and pests. Then came scorching June—a terrible month that saw thousands if not millions of caterpillars crawling across crops and trees, robbing us not only of the chance to climb our own trees, but also of a good harvest. Some of these insects were such specialists of destruction that vines in many of the sweet potato fields were left leafless. I remember Grandma’s immediate reaction—achievable as our field was small—being to pick off the caterpillar-infested leaves and bury them in the soil. The next day, she took ground hot chilies and mixed a good quantity of them in water, sprinkling the solution on the sweet potato vines. While her plan worked for us, it could not do so on large fields and farms. And so, the caterpillars continued their terrorism, assisted by the scorching temperatures. Although we were still on the safe side controlling and coping with the caterpillars, yet another challenge—water shortages—knocked on our door. Streams and natural springs dried up, and from morning 'til evening, children as young as myself would join the water chase. We walked with neighbours for miles and miles in search of hidden water pockets stashed away in forests and rocks. July to August was harvest time. The harvest, although varied, was very thin. First, sorghum, was used both to make flour for porridge as well as acting as an ingredient in a traditional brew called “kaliga” (which means lamb). The name kaliga is used for this brew because of its fresh taste, which is likened to the innocence and beauty of a lamb. Then there were tree peas, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, groundnuts, maize, and several other kinds of funny-looking hairy crops, some of which were traditionally eaten without salt. Everything was there, but in such small quantities you could see disappointed faces of young and old people as they harvested each crop. One day, after bringing our harvest home and helping Grandma do a bit of sorting, I decided to stroll over to our next-door neighbour, a fairly small family of seven, most of them aged under 20. I found them sitting under a huge bougainvillea tree, barefoot. There was so much silence. Only the hands were busy, eyes looking down at the crops that had failed to produce a miracle. Then, one of the girls broke the silence, saying, “What is a meal without beans?” In many parts of Uganda and Rwanda, beans replace meat, but now their ""meat"" had protested. Additionally, sweet potatoes were very small that season. Most grew long, thread-like structures inside, which made people lose their appetite. Those who forced themselves to eat it got indigestion and gagged; it was not really sweet potato anymore. Banana trees bore so few bananas—a mere five or ten, tiny and very thin fruits—not the hundred or more per plant in a normal harvest. As usual, I helped my disappointed hosts a little, then returned to meet my grandma. We had little, too, but it was only the two of us. Cassava was available, but had turned bitter and poisonous, even deadly. Although people died eating it, others continued to do so anyway. Food prices went up everywhere, and families whose harvests had failed badly worked on rich people’s farms. Called “food slaves,” they would be given a certain quantity of food instead of money. It was a common practice. The season was brutal, but somehow, people coped by eating things that would be impossible to eat in good times; hence the saying, ndiirabutafa, meaning, “I eat just for the sake of not dying.” However, it was not always like this. There were small, good times sometimes, such as when families produced a big harvest, and even got a surplus. That is when neighbours would send a small sampling of their harvest to others, especially to those who might have planted late. Grandma did this for a young man who had recently settled near us. He didn’t have a field ready with crop, just a natural grass-thatched hut and a good dog. Warming for marriage at 23, he was busy working like a donkey on many different farms to raise the dowry: many sacks of dried beans. In normal circumstances, the dowry a virginal young woman claimed would be a good number of cows, but in times of crisis, this adjustment to sacks of beans was still honourable. Time marched on, and soon it was September, then October: another season of planting to keep the chain of life going. November began with good rains, and all the farmers were relieved. Grandma had a variety of traditional indigenous crops that I rarely see these days. Among them were several kinds of richly coloured beans, swamp and upland yams, and leafy vegetables. The intervals of rain and sun continued normally for some time, until the notorious hailstones and mataba, or floods, came. At one point a woman, who was conversing with Grandma during a burial where two girls from the same family had been struck by lightning, described how, before it started to rain, she had seen a figure in the sky that I can only try to understand today as some kind of climate dragon. Such a sight was not the first rainy season that had come with ghosts, turning peaceful neighbourhoods into slaughterhouses. Among the indigenous Karamajongs, people and livestock died in the hundreds for days and days, rotating the death toll between hunger, disease, floods, and lightning. At the burial, as people continued to talk about the horror, I only remember looking intently into their eyes, switching from one person to another, and in the process, absorbing ever more climate stress. Unfortunately, as these things have continued to happen over and over again throughout my life, climate change and its losses have become like a normal, albeit agitating, illness. November and December, although unpredictable, have a way of leading people to relinquish bad memories. This is especially because in Uganda, these two months are associated with grasshoppers, a traditional delicacy. After the tragedies caused by lightning and floods, the long-awaited grasshoppers come, arriving in huge swarms across almost the entire central and western regions of Uganda, their beautiful humming filling everyone who hears them with so much hope. After nature had turned against the people, it was at last giving something back: a sign of its unbreakable contract with them. Hungry families and children woke up early in ‘Grasshopper November,’ heading for grasshopper hotspots: grasslands, maize fields, and banana plantations. Some families and individuals also set out a lamp at night, surrounded by improvised grasshopper-harvesting equipment. In the morning, both grasshoppers and happiness were bountiful. Finally, for days on end, people would have a free takeaway courtesy of nature’s unconditional benevolence. But the following year, 1985, it was the opposite. November and December became mean with their grasshoppers, causing many to ask: what is going on? Hot seasons became exceedingly violent, wrecking farms and fields. Bony-looking bodies were everywhere. You could hardly hear a single giggle from kids. It was much like Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring. Some of the local natural streams and springs where people used to collect water had dried up and were now replaced by ghostly cracks that seemed as though they would widen and swallow up all sorts of things. Chaos and desperation were everywhere. In the same season, local health centres were filled with sick, hungry people. But thanks to the presence of natural gardens and private ones maintained by traditional conservationists, tropical herbs from both helped—and still—save many lives. With access to electricity, television, and the internet, more people have begun to realise that what is happening in their communities is also happening in other parts of the world, all of which is caused by a reckless indifference to climate accountability.

"" These two photos (and the one above)—all taken in Muhanga town—propel and echo earth defenders' concern about secure food systems and secure ecosystems. From 2016 through 2018, I was a teacher and a farmer at the same time. Unlike other modern farmers, I didn't have the money to buy a spray pump, nor the chemicals to control pests on my maize field. Most of the pesticides used in Uganda and Rwanda are made in China and India. They are affordable, but not by everyone. As pests began raining on my field and all around me, other farmers were already prepared, busy spraying their fields of maize, tomato, and cabbage. I was the odd one out, restless for a solution. It was my energy, my time, and finally, my crop at stake. Cornered into coming up with a solution, I observed that the pests start laying eggs inside the bud of each maize plant, eat the buds, then move out to the other leaves, redesigning each with multiple holes. I asked myself, “Since the pest does not come from the soil, could soil be an enemy to the pest?” As I investigated deeper, I discovered a rodent’s burrow. I noticed fine soil at the front, which the animal had pushed out in a bid to create enough space for itself and its family. I took small but sufficient amounts of this soil, spreading it into the bud of each plant, repeating this exercise day after day. Quite happily, this observation-led experiment worked, not only spelling the end of the maize pests, but providing a miraculous harvest I had never dreamt of. Many of the maize plants had three long maize cobs on them, well filled with healthy-looking cereals. I entered the next season with a surplus from the previous one. In 2022 and 2023, I repeated this routine in Rwanda, and the results were equally amazing, superior even to those who used toxic pesticides. I have now named this approach ‘Nature Treats Nature,’ and I shared it at COP27. This experience confirms the story shared by a Jewish rabbi, Yonatan Neril, during an interfaith session at COP27, that “the solutions to the climate problem are within our hands.” They are indeed. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/05/12/global-newsletter-76/,"Rebels march through London and call for an end to fossil fuels during The Big One. This issue: XR UK’s The Big One | South America Earth Day | US Bank Takeover | Dear rebel, At the start of this year, XR UK announced it was (temporarily) giving up public disruption. Instead, they would prioritise public attendance, reaching out beyond their own movement to build a mass protest where arrest was unlikely and sheer volume would force the government into negotiation. The protest would win the support (and the supporters) of other eco-groups, trade unions, community organisations and charities. It would be the most inclusive and accessible rebellion ever. It would be The Big One. Last Generation smear ecocidal corporations with fake oil during Berlin’s Rebellion. You can find out whether this bold tactical shift bore big enough fruit by heading to Action Highlights. There you can also read about rebellions in two more cities, with rebels blockading the banks of New York and smearing the climate-criminals of Berlin. We also report on a wave of inspiring Earth Day actions in South America, with 23 XR groups rising up across the continent. Rebels staged ariel dances in Colombia, a nuclear disaster in Brazil, and rallied against mining laws outside Chile’s parliament. Find out much more in Action Highlights. A dance performance in Bogotá, Colombia, part of the ‘Earth in Rebellion’ campaign. Whether XR UK choose to continue their experiment with civil obedience, or return to the disruptive tactics that defined them, the amazing activist alliance that supported The Big One should be celebrated. The system that relentlessly pollutes our skies, exploits workers, stokes wars, and plunders the Global South for profit is one and the same, and the sooner we unite, the sooner our shared enemy will be defeated. The only positive of such an unjust system is how it enriches the soil of activism. New grassroot organisations are sprouting up every day, each with their own focus and tactics. We must keep linking roots, keep cross-pollinating ideas and actions. It is only through organic experimentation and collaboration between activists that the roadmap to a sustainable planet will be drawn. And draw it we must.

Give What You Can 21 - 24 APRIL | London, UK There were marches so big you had to queue to join them. There were moving speeches, star-studded musical sets, pickets outside government buildings, and peoples' assemblies using clever software to allow ideas to be uploaded and rated. But there was a key ingredient missing from this rebellion in the city where rebellion first began. And that was disruption. Instead, this would be a rebellion where anyone concerned about the climate crisis could attend without fear of arrest, and sheer numbers would force the government into dialogue. This would be The Big One. For four days, Westminster became a place of creativity, solidarity, and public assembly. A direct benefit of this tactical softening was the unprecedented support of over 200 eco and social justice groups, with stalls from many of them lining the stretch of road outside parliament which hosted the 4-day rebellion. There was also a distinct lack of police. Gone were the colonnades of scowling police officers, swooping in to randomly arrest someone or seize a speaker system. Now we had a small army of smiling rebel stewards, making sure pavements were kept clear, schedules were kept to, and disruption was kept to a minimum. But this more loving, less rage-filled era also had its problems. After making a lot of fuss about how the rebellion would ruin the neighbouring London Marathon (it didn’t), the British media pretty much ignored The Big One, and so too did the government. Rebels and other activists may have massed at parliament’s doorstep, but clearly the numbers required to get that door to open were not met. An Algerian refugee talks of his harrowing journey to the UK and how seeking happiness should be a human right. That’s not to say that attendance figures were bad. At least 60,000 people attended the Earth Day biodiversity march around Westminster, and across the 4 days XR UK’s goal of 100,000 attendees was certainly met. The Big One’s broad new alliance also brought in fresh faces and enriched actions, like the rally outside the Home Office where an Algerian asylum seeker spoke movingly about his perilous journey across the English Channel before rebels launched 1000s of small pink paper boats in solidarity with migrants everywhere. XR UK’s open-arm approach, and the amazing activist alliance that resulted, should be celebrated. But for a future Big One to challenge that system, it either needs to be a lot bigger, or a lot more disruptive, or (somehow) both. Rebel scientists outline the tactical dilemma now facing XR UK. The rebellion’s final people's assembly showed that the vast majority want to return to disruptive actions, despite the UK’s draconian new protest laws. Whether this might diminish or fire up the fledgling activist alliance remains to be seen. XR has long been a space where family-friendly actions and spicy civil disobedience can co-exist peacefully, each enriching the movement in their own special way. The hope is that XR UK can now build on the alliances forged during The Big One, and ensure The Next One finds that sweet spot between nice and spicy, between big and attention-grabbing, and makes those in power so agitated they actually open that door.

Photo: barbarafreitxs Rebellion has swept through South America to mark Earth Day. After centuries of unchecked extractivism, 23 XR groups, including rebels in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela, united under the ‘Earth in Rebellion’ (Tierras en Rebeldía) banner to tell governments and corporations that they’ve had enough. In Brazil, rebels joined Greenpeace activists for a radioactive demonstration in front of the Ceará's state government headquarters. A rebel covered in burns lay before gas-masked figures, a warning of how disaster looms if uranium mining is allowed to continue contaminating the region. The military police were certainly scared, forcing the activists off the pavement on the grounds that they were violating the building’s security perimeter, and then threatening to call in heavily armed riot police if they didn’t leave. Rebels in Bogotá dance like bees, rally in the streets, and paint a mural. In Colombia, XR Bogotá highlighted biodiversity loss in local wetlands and forests by staging a bee-inspired aerial silk dance that included a special message from Mother Nature. After a rally and a street-lecture by a local professor, the action ended with rebels painting an intricate mural together on the tarmac that symbolised the message of the day: Time is running out; transition or extinction. Rebels protested against the expansion of a huge Anglo American copper mine in central Chile, which threatens the health and water security of all life in the regions of Valparaíso and Santiago. XR Santiago rallied outside the parliament that recently approved the mine’s expansion and called on the Environment Minister to resign. In Argentina, rebels shared their fears about the climate crisis on the Plaza del Mayo in Buenos Aires, pasted posters overnight across La Plata, and held open-air festivals in Missiones and Gbaoeste. Poster-pasting in La Plata, Argentina. A rally against deforestation in La Paz, Bolivia. A coalition of activists including rebels massed at the entrance of Chapultepec park in Mexico City to condemn political inaction on the climate emergency and ecocidal companies like PEMEX, the state-owned oil company. Before a rebel performance where ‘animals’ were doused in PEMEX ‘oil’, there was a one-minute silence for all the activists that had been imprisoned and murdered in the region. Despite the peacefulness and wide appeal of these actions, environmental activism in South America is highly dangerous: in Colombia alone, 65 environmental defenders were killed in 2020. Regardless of the risk to their lives, the rebels of South America are managing to oppose ecocidal corporations and their negligent governments on an ever-increasing scale. 24 APRIL - 3 MAY | NYC, San Francisco, Charlotte, Washington DC, USA Rebels spray-paint the windows of bank Wells Fargo, New York City. In a noisy, multi-day protest spanning ‘Earth Day to May Day’ (and beyond), hundreds of climate activists young and old came together outside three major US banks, demanding an end to their outrageous funding of the fossil fuel industry. The world’s 60 largest banks have poured $5.5 trillion into fossil fuel projects in the seven years since the Paris Agreement, and three of the worst - Citibank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America - are based in the US. Between them, these three banks have invested $932 billion in coal, oil and gas since 2016, and nearly $110 billion in the last year alone. Picking dates that coincided with their AGM's, rebels and other activists in New York, San Francisco and Charlotte, North Carolina headed to the banks' headquarters to cause as much disruption as possible. A rebel coalition forms outside Citibank in Manhattan, New York City In New York, a coalition including XR NYC, New York Communities for Change, Rise & Resist, Climate Organizing Hub and Sunrise Movement occupied the plaza outside Citi’s Manhattan HQ for two days. They drummed and danced, held discussions and workshops, sprayed the bank’s windows with the urgent demand for ‘NO NEW OIL’, and slept on the cold concrete with nothing but sleeping bags. Meanwhile, in Charlotte, North Carolina, activists from Green Faith, Rainforest Action Network, Third Act, and Scientist Rebellion surrounded Bank of America’s HQ, and in San Francisco, rebels and Stop the Money Pipeline activists blockaded Wells Fargo’s main office, orchestrating an impressive banner drop over its entrance. Protestors in front of a banner drop outside Wells Fargo HQ in San Francisco Over the next two days, Reclaim Our Tomorrow targeted fossil fuel-supporting investment firms, KKR and BlackRock, in New York’s Hudson Yards. When 75 protesters with pitchforks and fake oil tried to block the entrance to BlackRock, private security and police reacted violently, wrestling activists to the ground and arresting 11. To round off the week, hundreds more rebels – including from Scientist Rebellion and first-responders’ group Guardian Rebellion – created a lot of noise outside the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in Washington, D.C. And finally, nine rebels locked-on in a street by the Met Gala in New York, blocking a vehicle ferrying celebrities to the event. Eleven more protestors were arrested in New York for spray-painting Citibank, and branches of Bank of America and Wells Fargo. XR NYC is ensuring they all have support and legal representation as they await their appearance in court. 12 - 17 APRIL | Berlin, Germany Banner: “Proclaim a biodiversity state of emergency!” Photo: Jana Legler A thousand rebels turned a rainy week in Berlin into a heart-warming week of action! They mobilised across the capital to demand their government declare a biodiversity emergency and convene a citizens' assembly to tackle the climate crisis. The rebellion started with setting up a base camp in a park in central Berlin, offering rebels free food, workshops, music and support for the week ahead. Several trainings and talks were organised by activists from the Global South, and a general focus of the camp was to promote anti-racism and inclusive action. The next day, a big demo headed from the park to the Brandenburg Gate. The march featured ironic celebration of the super-rich, and their continued profiting at the expense of everyone else on the planet. As famous ‘billionaires’ prepared their rocket to planet B, suited dinosaurs from the fossil fuel industry partied on. Left: A giant banner is dropped from a luxury Berlin hotel. Right: Billionaires prepare to board their oh-so-exclusive rocket. Photos: Alex & Eike The carbon emissions of the richest 1% are more than double the emissions of the poorest half of humanity. So to break up the billionaire’s party, rebels dropped a massive banner from the side of a super-exclusive hotel, making it very clear that we can no longer afford the super-rich! Activists from Scientist Rebellion and Last Generation also smeared the buildings of a dozen corporations, lobby groups, and political parties who continue to compound environmental destruction. There was a lot of media coverage on this second day of rebellion, and exacerbated by the total lack of climate action from the government, the German public are increasingly supporting these kinds of protests. Left: XR Drummers set the marching beat. Right: Topless rebels protest on Museum Island. Photos: Jennifer von der Heydt & Eike After this fantastic start, the rebellion didn’t let up. Animal Rebellion led a big protest against industrial animal agriculture, and there was a flash mob at the city’s Central Station, warning travellers of the need for an immediate species protection programme if we want to save our ecosystems. The week concluded with several marches and demonstrations focusing on the biodiversity crisis, as well as some smaller, more targeted actions, like the one where a river was dyed green outside the headquarters of agrochemical giant Bayer, or where rebels confronted museum-goers with the naked truth: there’s no art on a dead planet! With no major police interventions, good media attention, and a wonderful turnout, Berlin’s Spring rebellion was a great success. Throughout the week, a lot of money was raised as well, and a fifth of the donations will go to rebel groups in the Global South. 10 - 16 APRIL | Global: As delegates arrived for the IMF & World Bank Spring Meeting in Washington, rebels joined Debt For Climate activists to rally outside. Solidarity actions were held around the world, including in Uganda (pictured). 14 APRIL | Italy: Rebel actions were held in Rome, Milan and Bologna to highlight how Italy’s public broadcaster RAI fails to honestly report the severity of the climate crisis. Banners were hung and sit-ins were held outside three of RAI’s main offices. 14 APRIL | Nairobi, Kenya: Activists with the Polly Foundation conduct a day of school eco-education that finishes with tree planting. 17 APRIL | Sheffield, UK: A table at the world snooker championships is doused with powdered dye by a Just Stop Oil activist. No damage was done. Days later, two Just Stop Oil activists were sentenced to 3 years in prison for climbing a bridge in London, the longest ever sentence for a peaceful climate action in UK history. 20 APRIL | Amsterdam, Netherlands: Victory! After a sustained campaign by Scientist Rebellion, Vrije University becomes the second in the world to cut ties with the fossil fuel industry (the first was Princeton in the USA). Get your university to be the third! 21 APRIL | Melbourne, Australia: A dozen rebels pitched their pop-up tents in the foyer of Exxon Mobil's headquarters. An Occupy For Climate rebellion will take place in the city from May 25th to 27th. Commit to going here.

Activists even built an actual wall across the route, which will widen existing roads between Toulouse and Castres and devastate the local environment. 28 APRIL | Copenhagen, Denmark: As part of the Befri Jorden - Free the Earth - demonstration, rebels transform the street in front of the Danish parliament into a giant garden. The blockade was so large that the police couldn’t arrest everyone, though they managed to arrest over 300! Resilient rebels are planning to return on May 12th. 5 MAY | Mutare, Zimbabwe: Rebels conducted a litter clean-up of the Fern Valley, encouraging locals to join them in caring for their environment.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/05/12/newsletter-xtra-76/,"Welcome to Newsletter XTRA, where everything we couldn’t fit into the main Global Newsletter has its moment to shine. This month we cover actions in Denmark, Rwanda, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Norway, Sweden, Australia, USA, UK and more… 2 MAY | Copenhagen, Denmark: Scientist Rebellion activists and rebels splash ‘blood’ across the entrance to the Ministry of Environment, a reminder that violence against nature is violence against us. 7 activists were arrested, including 3 who were just holding a banner! Denmark is one of the most cultivated countries in the world, with only 2% protected nature. It is the third-largest issuer of exemptions for use of illegal and unapproved pesticides in the EU, and its insect populations are dwindling fast. More than half of its drinking water wells are contaminated with toxic residues. 25 APR | Kigali, Rwanda: A rebel tells it how it is: Fossil fuels = death, displacement, destruction, refugees… 1 MAY | France: Rebels took part in widespread Labour Day actions across France, including Perpignan (left) and Besancon (right). 25 APR | Lorient, France: Rebel groups from the Brittany towns of Lorient, Vannes, Concarneau and Quimper staged a die-in action against private jets. 27 APR | Washington DC, USA: Two parents terrified about their children's futures (as well as all children) smeared paint onto the stand and glass case housing a famous sculpture by Edgar Degas at the National Gallery. MAY | Europe-wide: Simultaneous student occupations closed universities and schools in Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Germany, the Czech Republic and the UK. The wave of action, due to last all month, was under the banner of End Fossil: Occupy! It follows similar occupations last autumn at 49 schools and universities. The students aim to be the spark that ignites the rest of society into action, like the Parisian students of May '68 who galvanised one of the largest general strikes in French history under the banner, ""Be Realistic, Ask for the Impossible."" 23 APR | Belgrade, Serbia: A rebel marathon runner and two colleagues conveyed the message to athletes and fans at the Belgrade marathon that climate change is fast, and we have to be faster! 10 APR | Colombo, Sri Lanka: XR Sri Lanka was invited to the Youth Climate Ambassadors program organised by the British Council. They represented the Western Province as a youth climate activist group. After a presentation on XR's principals, values and activism, the rebels planned three future projects with the Western Province Youth Climate Ambassadors. These rebels-to-be will be supporting and collaborating with XR Sri Lanka in future actions. 25 APR | Bonn, Germany: Rebels rallied in front of Bonn’s train station against Mexico’s ecocidal Tren Maya project, in which the German railway organisation, Deutsche Bahn, is heavily involved. The 1525 km Tren Maya route is being built through unique, protected ecosystems and indigenous territories in the Yucatan peninsula in south-east Mexico, with the mega-project due to be completed in 2024. 29 APR | Washington DC, USA: Hundreds of Climate Defiance activists blockaded the White House Correspondents Dinner and protested the US President’s recent approval of deadly new oil and gas projects in Alaska and elsewhere. 27 APR | Oslo, Norway: Rebels greeted some 3,000 passengers who disembarked from the world’s largest methane-powered ‘gas ship’ AidaNova, which the cruise industry believes is a green solution. They handed out over 2,000 flyers that told the truth: GREEN cruising is a scam! 3 MAY | Perth, Australia: An environmental activist sprayed Woodside logos on a Police Centre and glued her arm to the glass in solidarity with the campaign to disrupt the Energy giant’s Burrup Hub liquid natural gas mega-project. In March, the activist had her 15-month prison sentence thrown out on appeal when it emerged police had made false assertions that initially led to her being jailed under new anti-protest legislation. She said: “Woodside love to slap their logo on the prized cultural institutions in this state, at the same time they spray their toxic emissions all over sacred First Nations rock art and our children's future.” 16 APRIL | Newcastle, Australia: 50 activists with Rising Tide swarmed a loaded coal train at the world's largest coal port. They climbed atop its carriage, halting it for three hours. All were arrested. Photo: Carly Cook 1 MAY | Malmö, Sweden: Rebels took to the streets for Labour Day. With many other groups they highlighted that the companies that exploit nature are the same that exploit people – through low salaries, high prices, precarious employments, lessened asylum rights, lack of healthcare … and not least the imperialism being carried out across the world in the hunt for oil, alongside the destruction of the natural world we all live in and from. 26 APR | Uppsala, Sweden: Dressed as red-listed beetles, rebels replanted indigenous trees in a section of forest cut in 2022 and subsequently turned into a construction site, despite findings of endangered cinnabar beetle larvae in the area. A rebel said: “It has taken centuries to grow this forest before the municipality decided to replace it with concrete. Today we try to undo some of the harm the municipality did when they cut down mighty trees, dug out their roots, let the undergrowth die and flattened the ground. Hopefully, the trees planted today can after many decades become the habitat of rare species again”. 4 MAY | Canary Wharf, London, UK: In their first UK gig the ‘Polymetallic Nodules’, members of Ocean Rebellion, performed a ‘shout along’ outside the Deep Sea Mining Summit. Fans joined in with deep sea favourites like ‘Butchering the seabed’ and ‘We all die (plankton)’. The band’s ear-splitting sound is a lot quieter than the noise deep sea mining inflicts on marine life, estimated at 100 times louder than a space rocket launch. Whales and other deep-diving animals rely on sound to hunt prey, locate mates, and make migrations. Deep sea mining will disrupt this, seriously damaging delicate ecosystems. 28 APRIL | Melbourne, Australia: A lone rebel climbed the spire of the Arts Centre, Melbourne and deployed a giant pink banner. He was supported by dozens of protesters and remained aloft for 3 hours before being brought down and arrested by police. 23 APRIL | Amsterdam, Netherlands: Rebels joined with other ecoactivists to rally outside and inside the AGM of ING, the country’s most polluting bank. ING invests billions into new oil and gas projects across the Global South, including in Mozambique and Colombia. The AGM was eventually suspended after 130 activist shareholders that included rebels sang, held up banners, and demanded the bank reject fossil fuels. 29 APR | Bologna, Italy: This lone rebel’s placard reads, “I am afraid my father will die from the climate crisis.” His father has heart disease and experiences the heat as a mortal threat. Italian summers are hot, and each one is now hotter than the last. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/04/17/oceans-our-unsung-heroes/,"At last, since the idea was first discussed in an informal UN meeting in 2002 and after 5 rounds of multinational negotiations, the text of a United Nations treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas was agreed late on Saturday March 4th in New York. “We praise countries for seeking compromises, putting aside differences and delivering a treaty that will let us protect the oceans, build our resilience to climate change and safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people,” said Greenpeace’s Dr. Laura Meller. Thanks to Jeremy Bishop for the image. Unsplash The high seas are the ocean waters which lie beyond the national boundaries of coastal states. As a vast stateless region, it is especially vulnerable to uncontrolled and damaging industries like commercial fishing and deep-sea mining. Elements of the treaty include setting up a legal framework to create marine protected areas, setting rules on environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and bringing a fairer distribution between richer and poorer nations of the benefits from the commercialization of substances derived from marine genetic resources (such as from corals, sponges, seaweeds, and bacteria for cosmetic and pharmaceutical products etc.). For representatives of 193 countries to reach agreement is a major achievement, but the next potential hurdle is delay. Before the Treaty can do its job, countries must adopt and ratify it. Liz Karan, director of Pew’s ocean governance project urged governments to “ensure the agreement is adopted and rapidly enters into force and is effectively implemented to safeguard high seas biodiversity.” Oceans are Earth’s unsung life support system. No matter where you are, or what you are, they make all life possible. And as the high seas cover 64 percent of the global ocean, safeguarding them effectively is vital to us all. They are critical to sustaining the world's biodiversity both on land and in the water, and they enable human societies to thrive. But what exactly do oceans do for the world? The answer is, much more than you probably think: Phytoplankton are microscopic free-floating plants drifting in the world’s oceans, lakes and rivers. In their billions and trillions, making food through photosynthesis (using sunlight energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose) they produce huge quantities of oxygen as a by-product. Together with seaweeds and sea grasses, phytoplankton generate between 50 and 80 percent of Earth’s oxygen. And there’s a double bonus, because photosynthesis on so vast a scale also takes in a massive amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. NASA estimates that over 100 million tons of carbon dioxide is drawn into the ocean by marine phytoplankton – every day. Marine habitats, such as mangroves and tidal salt-marshes also play a vital role in mitigating impacts of the climate crisis, with their superb carbon capturing capacity. Thanks to Beth Watson and the Ocean Image Bank for the image Oceans keep us cool. Water evaporates from the surface, cooling seas and enabling them to mop up atmospheric heat. Since 1955 oceans have absorbed over 90 percent of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, shielding us from more severe effects of a changing climate. Ocean currents regulate global climate systems, redistributing the sun’s heat and moisture around the planet, moderating otherwise extreme temperatures and keeping the land liveable for plants and animals alike. Oceans also drive the planetary water cycle – the continuous flow of water evaporation, which leads to cloud-formation, and in turn rain – on to land, rivers and the sea. The variety and quantity of plant and animal species in the sea is almost beyond comprehension – comprising up to 80 percent of all life on Earth. Perhaps more extraordinary is that scientists estimate 91 percent of ocean species have yet to be classified. On land, habitable space is a relatively thin layer of possibility; in the ocean it is much greater. Space for life stretches down from the water’s surface to the seafloor, which may be several thousand metres below – that means roughly 98 percent of Earth’s living space is either on the waves or beneath them. This helps explain the untold variety of marine life. It ranges from microscopic bacteria, to a blue whale weighing 200 tons; from a frigate bird gliding two miles above the sea’s surface to the remarkable dumbo octopus dancing in the depths, five miles below it. We are spellbound by the beauty, the wonder and the drama of life in the sea. As well as billions of marine animals, oceans feed many land-living species, such as birds, bears and wolves. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that over three billion people also depend on marine fish and shellfish as their main source of protein, whether farmed or from wild-capture fisheries. There are several more million of us who may not be reliant on seafood, but eat it regularly nevertheless. And roughly two hundred million people are directly or indirectly employed in fisheries, sustaining thousands of coastal communities worldwide. Some cultures have long included marine plants in their diet (seaweed in Japan for instance). More recently, the rising demand for marine plants (used in sushi, sauces, and salads) has made seaweed farming the fastest growing form of aquaculture. Seaweeds are very nutritious and they take up a large amount of carbon dioxide as they grow, so they benefit both whoever enjoys seaweed cuisine and the environment. Oceans improve our physical and mental health. Gazing over a flickering sea from a cliff top, or lying in the sand listening to the rhythm of the waves, is calming and reassuring. Being in that big blue and grey space of sea and sky can lift our mood like nothing else. Over the world, the beach is also our most popular holiday destination and the sea our biggest playground – to swim, to dive, surf, and sail – to have fun, keep fit and connect with the natural world. Thanks to Fabrice Dudenhofer and the Ocean Image Bank for the image As well as all that oceans do now, if we’re smart they can do even more. The global ocean is the largest store of power on Earth. Harnessing just some of that power can yield an everlasting, clean supply of energy – and free us from our fossil-fuelled world. Presently, marine renewable energy comes mainly from offshore wind, tides and waves. Scientists calculate that wave power alone could supply at least twice the global demand for electricity. Newer technologies are gaining momentum too. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) for instance, captures energy from temperature differences between cooler deep water and warmer surface waters. The world’s oceans will be healthier (as will we be) when a clean-energy-based economy replaces one powered by fossil fuels. And it could be kismet that the untapped forces of the oceans themselves can speed up that transition. They can help us to help them. Despite being completely dependent on healthy oceans to survive, modern societies have been emptying seas of wildlife, polluting waters, destroying underwater and coastal habitats, and weakening Earth’s natural systems for decades. The list of human-driven threats to the world’s oceans is long and overwhelming. Broadly they fall into two camps; those caused by what we do on land, and those by what we do at sea. All kinds of pollutants enter the sea continually; industrial discharges, agricultural run-off, sewage, discarded fishing gear, and plastic waste washed in from landfill and drainage systems, left on beaches, or dumped overboard. Industrial fishing has exhausted seas of many fish species, frequently demolishing underwater habitats and killing huge numbers of non-target wildlife in the process. The shipping, construction, oil, gas and mining industries pollute waters and cause serious disturbance to marine life. Invasive species are transported (mainly by ships) beyond their native range, such as the Green crab and Zebra mussel, and can be devastating for the ecosystems they invade. These industries, together with naval vessels using sonar, create underwater noise pollution, which is particularly harmful to whales, porpoises and dolphins. The impacts of fossil fuel emissions are becoming increasingly evident each year that passes. Higher temperatures are melting-ice caps, raising sea-levels, and causing stress to wildlife – many species showing reduced fertility or driven to change their migratory and feeding patterns. Excess atmospheric carbon dioxide is making sea water more acidic, which is bad news for marine life. The full effects of ocean acidification are uncertain, but it is known to inhibit the growth of the shells and skeletons of many species, including hard corals. It could have drastic consequences for whole ecosystems, for biodiversity, and even for the planet’s primary life-support systems. Coral reefs have the greatest diversity of species of all Earth’s habitats, but they face multiple threats; from destructive fishing (such as trawling and dynamite fishing), pollution, acidification, and rising sea temperatures, which lead to coral bleaching. Thanks to Martin Colognoli and the Ocean Image Bank for the image In the fight to tackle the climate crisis, the oceans are our greatest ally. You’d be a fool to turn on your comrade-in-arms as you marched towards the battle-front; to kick him to the ground and still expect him to be your defender – and yet we’ve been doing the equivalent to the world’s oceans since the industrial age began (and to a lesser degree, even before). Robust and resilient oceans, with clean waters brimming with wildlife can absorb more heat and carbon dioxide, can produce more oxygen, provide more food and employment, and safer places for people to live, than if they are weakened, degraded and depleted of life. The newly negotiated High Seas Treaty is being described as a ‘turning point’ and a ‘landmark moment for the ocean’. That could be true – time will tell – it is certainly less than perfect. Conservationists wanted more. For instance, the bodies currently regulating fisheries, shipping and deep-sea mining won’t have to undertake EIAs as detailed in the treaty text, which could seriously undermine its potential to protect wildlife in the high seas. But it was thought better to have a flawed Treaty than none at all. Imperfection aside, after such a prolonged process, so many countries finally agreeing on a plan to protect high seas biodiversity is good news. As Dr Meller succinctly put it, “This is a historic day for conservation and a sign that in a divided world, protecting nature and people can triumph over geopolitics”. Most of us know about plastic pollution in the sea and the importance of avoiding single-use plastics. Here are four other actions to take. Deb Rowan Wright is an independent researcher and writer on marine policy. Her book, Future Sea: How to rescue and protect the world’s oceans questions the reasoning behind current approaches to ocean conservation and presents a radical alternative. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

Photo: @noatenjov This issue: France’s Mega-Basin Battle | Argentina Mono-Forests | XR UK Big One Dear rebel, If the world’s finest scientists announced that our civilisation was in grave danger, and only radical changes made right now could save the day, you’d expect there to be a bit of a fuss. Yet the new IPCC Report summarising a decade of climate science concluded just that, even after heavy editing by governments safeguarding the oil and meat industries, and it (at best) made news headlines for a day. Even more amazingly, the governments most culpable for this spiralling disaster have committed to making it worse, greenlighting more fossil fuel extraction and ensuring that the drastic emission cuts that the report urgently calls for are impossible. This IPCC graph shows how unbelievably badly our governments are doing. Yet again, our governments and media have shown us that they cannot wield their power responsibly. Which leaves us with no choice but to rely on people power generated by civil disobedience. In Action Highlights we cover a brutal power struggle brewing over water between the French state and its people, and we report on XR Argentina’s efforts to end monoculture forests that greenwash logging companies before bursting into flames. For Humans of XR we hear from someone in the newest group of our rebel family, XR Zimbabwe. And in a Raveller Report (courtesy of Raveller, a new ecozine founded by former newsletter writers) we look at the oldest group, asking what XR UK’s upcoming and uniquely collaborative rebellion, The Big One, might mean for the wider movement.

Give What You Can 25 & 26 MAR | Sainte-Soline, France Earth’s Uprisings shows that activists, farmers and (some) politicians can unite to tackle the climate crisis. Photo: Les Soulèvements de la Terre. Activists and agriculturalists rallied under the banner of new eco-collective Earth’s Uprisings (Les Soulèvements de la Terre) to disrupt the stealth privatisation of water in increasingly drought-ridden rural France. 30,000 protesters (including rebels) marched to the construction site of one of a series of planned mega-basins - huge open-air water reservoirs that will irrigate industrial agriculture to the detriment of everything else, from small-scale farmers to river ecosystems. The first wave of protesters aimed to build a peaceful human chain around the mega-basin, but the police response was immediate and extremely violent. The French countryside became a war zone, the air filled with rubber bullets, tear-gas, and the noise of over 5000 explosive stun grenades. 200 activists were wounded, 40 severely, with injuries including grenade shards embedded in their flesh (warning: gruesome imagery). Two remain in a coma. Security forces even blocked emergency services from assisting the wounded. And this brutal response was to, absurdly, protect nothing but a giant hole in the ground. Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas, and maiming stun grenades. Photo: @noatenjov The plan is for 16 state-financed mega-basins to be built in the French countryside, with water collected during the winter, so it can irrigate fields in the increasingly dry summers. But these basins threaten to dry up watersheds, shrink rivers and destroy local biodiversity. The exposed water is also more vulnerable to evaporation and bacterial growth, and will only be made available to 6% of farmers in the region. Nonetheless, the French government continues to fund and support the initiative. The interior minister has launched an effort to dissolve Earth’s Uprisings - a move denounced by the head of the French Greens. Huge solidarity rallies have taken place across the country, and the protesters refuse to be cowed: “We will continue the fight, despite the intimidation and extreme brutality used by the government.” 21- 31 MAR | Misiones & Buenos Aires, Argentina Rebels perform outside Arauco’s Buenos Aires HQ. Photo: Julieta Gimenez To coincide with the International Day of Forests, 18 rebels staged a striking protest-performance outside the Buenos Aires headquarters of Arauco, a multinational logging corporation that has destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest in the most biodiverse regions of Argentina. The state-backed corporation has replaced native old-growth forests in Corrientes and Misiones with fast-growing, pesticide-sprayed pine and eucalyptus monocultures which have destroyed native ecosystems, poisoned locals, dried soils, and fuelled by the trees’ innate flammability, caused vast forest fires. A week after the protest-performance, ten rebels travelled to Iguazú Falls in Misiones, one of the most richly biodiverse national parks in the world. En route, the rebels defaced Arauco billboards along the highway, calling out their years of ecocide. On arrival, they donned animal masks and Green Brigade costumes, winning the attention and enthusiastic support of passing visitors. Rebels ensure Arauco’s billboards tell the truth. Photo: Marcelo Rodriguez Lobo By devastating long-established flora and fauna, drying and depleting the soil, and planting concentrated pine and eucalyptus, Arauco is fuelling increasingly extreme and frequent forest fires across Argentina and beyond. In 2022, wildfires in Corrientes resulted in the loss of over a million hectares of forest and threatened the lives and livelihoods of many, particularly Indigenous people. Arauco is also one of the logging companies fuelling huge forest fires in Chile. In February this year, 326,000 hectares burned between the regions of Ñuble and Araucanía alone. This series of rebel actions is only the beginning of a campaign planned against commercial logging, deforestation and monocultures. XR Buenos Aires has been steadily growing in recent months, and they are forging links with Indigenous groups on the frontlines of ecological and climate crimes across Argentina.

The Green Brigade appear at the incredible Iguazú Falls. 5 MAR | Italy: Fountains were dyed green in Genoa and red (with beetroot powder) in Turin to highlight Italy’s increasing water crisis. In the north, the Adige river has a water deficit of -98% and the Po, Italy’s main river, of -90%. 11 MAR | The Hague, Netherlands: Police used a water cannon and arrested about 700 protestors when the A12 motorway was again blockaded by thousands of rebels demanding an end to the vast fossil fuel subsidies paid by their government each year. 100 Scientist Rebellion scientists and academics, and an orchestra, were in attendance. 21 MAR | Cape Town, South Africa: Hundreds of activists - an intergenerational movement of civil society that included rebels - chanted on a March For System Change co-organised by Don’t Gas Africa. 22 MAR | Worldwide: World Water Day saw actions highlighting issues with water access across the globe, from rebels in Malaga, Spain (above) to women in rural Uganda. 27 - 29 MAR | Vienna, Austria: The European Gas Conference attracted multiple actions. Hundreds of rebels and other protestors, including an eloquent representative from DontGasAfrica, blockaded roads surrounding the conference venue. Activists with We Smell Gas, a new climate justice collective, disrupted a heavily guarded gala dinner, and turned seven of the city’s fountains green to emphasise how green gas is a dirty lie. So many actions happened this month, we can’t fit them all into one newsletter. Find out about actions in Croatia, Guyana, Norway Spain, USA, & more by reading Newsletter XTRA: A feast for the eyes and extra fuel for the soul! Read Newsletter XTRA My name is Jussa, I am the country coordinator for XR Zimbabwe. We are a fairly new group, launched during COP27. We conducted a tree planting campaign in December 2022 as our first action. At the moment, we count seven members, but more and more people are taking an interest in us, and we are growing as a movement. We are motivated to act by the environmental injustice and economic challenges which we are facing as a country. We need to do something against the effects of climate change that are already directly affecting us, try to raise awareness, especially among the youth, and push against policies that are a danger to marginalised communities. I’m passionate about working with young people and advocating for environmental, economic and gender justice. I feel that young people must participate more in political discussion and be involved in all developmental issues that affect their lives. They shouldn’t wait for the elders to decide for their future. I come from Mutare, in the province of Manicaland, in the east of the country. In 2019, my home was badly affected by Cyclone Idai. There were many lives and livelihoods lost. That’s when we organised and started doing clean-up campaigns and tree planting. When we came across XR Global, we decided that we need a chapter in Zimbabwe. We have observed that a radical approach to the environmental and climate challenges we face today is the most appropriate if we want to get the changes that we deserve and need. Many organisations use a meek or soft approach to issues and do not take action. As the XR Zimbabwe chapter, we are fully committed and believe in what we do and have the zeal to push our agenda forward… radically. We intend to build and transform our chapter into a serious, grassroots, environmental and tax justice movement that decision makers will respect and listen to. Our voice should be loud enough to transcend all corners of Zimbabwe. My personal hope is for the activities of XR Zimbabwe in Mutare to launch more chapters in the country. And I also hope to see other XR countries coming together, fighting as a big movement and with one voice against the capitalist system that is driving climate change. If you know (or are) a rebel somewhere in the world with a story to tell, get in touch at xr-newsletter@protonmail.com The climate movement in the Global North is witnessing a fundamental transformation. After some difficult and complicated years following 2019’s highs and 2020’s lows, it looks like the effort against ecocide is finding the new shape it needs. And XR UK’s upcoming ‘Big One’, beginning on the 21st of April, could be a defining moment in this change. To many, recent history has a depressingly familiar shape. In 2019 a surge of new movements and energy – foremost XR, Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement – dislodged something important in the western climate conversation, and made rapid gains. We moved from ‘climate change’ to ‘climate crisis’. Government policies began to move in something like the right direction. And then – we lost momentum. This slowdown had all kinds of causes: Covid, Ukraine, a concerted backlash from authoritarians and billionaires. But the underlying truth might be that we had reached the limits of that phase and form of struggle. The 2019 wave had plenty of ambition, but quickly found its best success in ‘sounding the alarm’. Where other aims (in XR’s case: strident upgrades to net zero targets, and the serious uptake of citizens’ assemblies) proved difficult to push on, awareness-raising was euphorically doable. Media coverage of our actions was elided easily into coverage of our dire motivations. ‘Coverage’ became increasingly enshrined as our measure of success – or even as success in itself. But without a deeper basis, this model was always going to hit a moment where gains in ‘awareness’ dwindled, and press attention faltered. As two compassionate American commentators observed, in 2021, “Sunrise’s tactical repertoire is running up against hard limits”; the same was evidently true of XR and FFF. In 2023, awareness seems about as raised as it’s going to get. We’ve got enough greenwashing to repaint the Sahara, we’ve got mediocre prestige dramas all about how awful climate change could be, we’ve got rainforests worth of surveys about how most people are worried and want way more climate action. Perhaps way back in the good old days of twenty years ago we might have managed to believe that this ‘first’ phase would be sufficient. It’s harder to be naïve about power now: there are people holding reins, and they not only ‘would consider’ but are literally in the process of committing mass murder in order to preserve their status… Read the rest of this article by heading over to Raveller, a brand-new eco-zine created by former writers of this newsletter. After the report’s release, rebel scientists blindfolded iconic statues around the world, including in Copenhagen (left) and Dublin, to demand that world leaders face the facts! The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s synthesis report is here, and the world at large has paid little attention. But what is this report, who gets to write it, and just how accurate are its conclusions? Read on rebel, read on… XR UK: IPCC Synthesis Report - What Does It Say? What Does It Mean? Conservation scientist and rebel Charlie Gardner discusses the report with a founder of XR. Their excellent conversation moves into the wider failure of geopolitics to solve the climate crisis, and why people power is the answer. The Conversation: IPCC’s Conservative Nature Masks Action Needed Climate scientist Kevin Anderson highlights the report’s overly lenient timelines for emission reduction, and its over-reliance on computer models that champion speculative technologies and replicate global inequalities. Distilled: How Meat & Fossil Fuel Producers Watered Down the IPCC Report Governments can significantly edit the IPCC report’s ‘summary for policymakers’ (the section everyone reads, a full report can be thousands of pages). Recommendations for plant-based diets were gutted and carbon capture and storage was inflated. Heatmap: The Fraught Negotiations Behind The New IPCC Report Another grisly report on how governments lobbied scientists to weaken the report summary. Saudi Arabia, the USA, and China, all worked hard to soften the summary’s assessments and keep fossil fuels viable. They have blood on their hands. The Ministry for the Future begins with a harrowing description of a killer heatwave in India. Some might find that a disturbing way to begin a novel, but given that the fictional disaster is entirely realistic, it’s no more disturbing than every-day life, and at least in the book the heat wave triggers an equally believable turn towards real climate action. And The Ministry for the Future isn’t exactly a novel anyway. It does feature many narrative passages, but relatively little of that follows the doings of the main characters. None of the shifts in viewpoint or format are signalled or explained. There are also essays on economics, philosophy, psychology, politics, and history, likewise without context. It’s up to the reader to know what is fiction—and how much isn’t. This isn’t a novel. It’s an essay, a vision, a world. Few creative works take our planetary emergency seriously, but this one does, and does so in extraordinary detail. It is because the book begins with a disaster (and continues on through several more disasters) that when it delivers its note of hope, we can believe it. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/04/13/newsletter-xtra-75/,"Welcome to Newsletter XTRA, where everything we couldn’t fit into the main Global Newsletter has its moment to shine. This month we cover actions in Austria, Australia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Guyana, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA, and Zimbabwe. 29 MAR | Vienna, Austria: Three Ukrainian activists from FridaysForFuture joined the BlockGas protests in Vienna. Despite coming from a war-torn country, they were confronted by the police. 3 APR | Cape Town, South Africa: A small but high-profile Extinction Rebellion protest met the controversial Russian oil and gas seismic blaster, the Akademik Alexander Karpinsky, when it returned from creating oil and gas maps of a globally important marine sanctuary off Antarctica. Photo: Nic Bothma 1 APR | Berlin, Germany: For April Fools 30 rebels, some dressed as petrol-heads, put on a bike show in front of a luxury car dealership selling Jaguar and Land Rover fossil fuel vehicles. The activists suggested that the car dealer should introduce a new line of zero-emission vehicles in the form of bicycles. Photos: Stefan Mueller 21 MAR | USA: A large alliance of eco groups including XR rallied outside fossil fuel funding banks across the country. In DC, elders blockaded four banks with rocking chairs. In Seattle, Elders climbed ladders to blockade the front doors of Chase bank. 22 MAR | London, UK: Rebels spray-painted the offices of various tabloid newspapers to call out their suppression of the climate crisis. Balloons helped a large banner with the words ‘CORRUPT AS FUCK’ float up to the executive floor of Rupert Murdoch’s News UK offices. 7 MAR | Zimbabwe: On International Women’s Day, XR Zimbabwe called on all women to rise up and speak out for a liveable planet, climate stability, clean green energy, green jobs, nature protection, biodiversity and nature restoration. 6 MAR | Zagreb, Croatia: At a coal power plant in Plomin, XR Zagreb protested the import of coal from countries affected by conflicts, human rights violations, and those forced into debt crisis by creditor institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. 31 MAR | Bendigo, Australia: Dramatic scenes outside the National Australia Bank in Bendigo as three were arrested during a week of national action for MoveBeyondCoal. 30 MAR | Madrid, Spain: Rebels stained the Congress of Deputies with fake blood on the day 15 activists from Scientist Rebellion began their trial for doing the same action nearly a year earlier. They face terrorist charges that could lead to 8.5 years in prison! 1 MAR | Oslo, Norway: Greta Thunberg was twice detained during a demo demanding the removal of 151 wind turbines from reindeer pastures used by Sami herders. A transition to green energy should not come at the expense of Indigenous rights. 23 MAR | Copenhagen, Denmark: A rebel sounded the fire alarm at Christiansborg, the seat of the Danish parliament, after the UN climate panel published a new report so scary that the EU's climate chief said that if we don't speed up climate action, our children and grandchildren will have to fight wars for food and water. 10 MAR | Kalin’a, Guyana: Police in riot gear used teargas and batons against indigenous protestors defending the Amazon rainforest. Five were arrested, including a child. The Centrale Electrique de l’Ouest Guyanais (CEOG) plans to raze 80 hectares of forest belonging to indigenous people to build the world’s biggest hydrogen-based renewable energy storage facility (illustration above). The locals have been calling for the factory to be moved for 4 years. 24 MAR | Melbourne, Australia: Much loved Discobedience returned to Aussie streets as rebels danced the afternoon away for climate justice! Photos: Matt Hrkac and Danielle Judd 5 MAR | Finland: Elokapina (XR Finland) was one of the organisers of several Nature Marches which brought 7,500 people onto the streets to demand more nature and climate action from the incoming Finnish parliament and government. 5 APR | Washington DC, USA: Three days after its launch, Climate Defiance, a new, youth-led American collective using disruptive action to stop fossil fuels, shut down the White House climate czar's keynote speech, confronting him in front of hundreds of elite policymakers. Climate Defiance intends to blockade the White House correspondents’ dinner this month to demand an end to fossil fuel extraction on public land. 20 MAR | Chambery, France: Rebels and other activists blockaded the entrance to the Savoie-Mont-Blanc airport in protest against private jets. 4 APR | Amsterdam, The Netherlands: VICTORY! One of Europe's busiest airports, Amsterdam's Schiphol, announced that it will BAN private jets by 2025-26. This comes after months of protest from XR Netherlands and Greenpeace. 12 MAR | Stockholm, Sweden: Rebels staged a snow-free ski race through the streets of Stockholm to highlight the latest measure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: 419 parts per million (ppm) - and to protest the lies of Preem, Sweden’s largest fuel company and ""proud main sponsor” of the Vasaloppet, the world’s biggest cross-country ski race. Preem says it is moving towards a “more sustainable future”, when in fact it is continuing with the same large-scale production of fuel. 22 MAR | Cape Town, South Africa: A day after joining a major march calling for the government to enact system change and a just transition, rebels highlighted Cape Town’s water crisis. The city faces growing water demands, limited water sources, and ageing infrastructure, not to mention increasing droughts thanks to climate change.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/04/04/Red-Rebels-On-Film/,"R﻿ed Rebels, palms up, signal a gentle, determined plea. Replete with an unmistakable look, intense silence, and mime-like moves, the Red Rebels are, quite intentionally, riveting. In the words of artist and activist Doug Francisco, founder of the Red Rebels Brigade: ""We divert, distract, delight, and inspire the people who watch us."" American filmmaker Jonathan Schwartz of CMI (Climate Media Initiative), documents justice, climate, and indigenous rights issues. Over the years, he has witnessed a good deal of theatrical protest, from those opposing oil companies along the Amazon in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to mask-and-flipper-equipped sea-level-rising protestors in Paris. None, however, arrested his attention as did the eerily choreographed Rebels. He wondered if such powerful and provocative means of resistance would ever emerge and take hold in his native New England. It did. Moved and motivated, Schwartz met with the decentralized Boston-based Red Rebel Brigade to explore the possibility of a collaboration—one that could further propel both the Brigade's work as well as that of XR. Moving forward with Red Rebels' green light, Schwartz pooled the best resources possible, from cameras to crew. First, hewing to the highest production values, Schwartz used a cinema-quality 8K RED capture format. The team was equally top notch: Zack Richard and Allie Humenuk, Main Cinematographers; William Adeylott, Drone Operator; Reed Galloway, Composer; Bruce Bolden, Color Correction; Talia Sabato and Bob Ebener, Associate Producers; Alex Bouthillier, Editor; and Raziel Panic, Location Audio Mixer. The result, a 5:00 film now on XR Global media channels YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram, employs unexpected shifts in POV, speed, score, locations, and interactions, all of which add even more strength. This trio of images shows the Red Rebels on an isthmus of land, crossing a bridge, and broadening their reach on the sands of a beach. ""We come to support the arrest-ables, to de-escalate confrontational situations, we block roads by crossing slowly or flocking in junctions, just long enough to provoke emotive responses."" — Doug Francisco, Red Rebels Brigade A common link that the non-violent, always silent, Red Rebels share with film crews who cover them is that even when situated in the thick of contentious interactions, the Rebels somehow avoid the fray, sidestepping the level of physical danger that other demonstrators confront. Floating through it all, they exhibit the same kind of thick luck that shields film crews. And tying said link with a bow when it comes to danger-free drama, Schwartz is well versed in such matters, having spent years ensuring on-set cinematic safety standards through projects featuring the likes of Jon Hamm and John Malkovich. Yeah, a bit of name dropping here, but c'mon. After all, we are talking about getting attention, right?

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/03/10/global-newsletter-74/,"Activists with Debt For Climate occupy the German consulate in Panama. In this issue: Debt For Climate | Make Them Pay on Valentine’s Day | Stop EACOP | Dear rebel, Oil and gas companies have revealed their profits over the last year, and the figures are eye-watering. The five largest western oil and gas companies made $219 billion in profits, while industry-wide the profits are expected to exceed $400 billion. On this planet, money means power, and at a time when we desperately need to dismantle this industry to stop climate breakdown, its grip over our civilisation has never been stronger. Big Oil is flexing its new muscle by scaling back climate ambitions and scaling up oil and gas production. BP’s chief executive explained the policy shift in terms of energy security and affordability, concluding that “at the end of the day, we’re responding to what society wants”. Debt For Climate Tanzania march through Dar es Salaam calling for the Global South to get the same debt cancellation that Germany received after WWII. But no society wants to be obliterated. And that’s what we face if we keep letting Big Oil have its way (along with $1trillion in government subsidies). Faced with such a gargantuan enemy, we have no choice but to look outwards, and forge links across and beyond our movement. We must unite to survive. Which is why it’s so heartening that this issue’s Action Highlights covers three major actions where rebels have coordinated not just across continents but as part of a broad alliance of activist groups. Whether it be rallying outside German embassies with Debt For Climate to wipe out Global South debts, or blocking private jet runways as part of the Make Them Pay campaign, or teaming up with Stop EACOP to raise awareness of the vast oil pipeline being laid across Africa, rebels are building a movement of movements that can put the brakes on Big Oil’s disastrous drive towards destruction. Rebels in Cape Town, South Africa, protest against Standard Bank’s funding of EACOP. The oil and gas industry excuses its monstrous profits, its ecocidal expansion, its capture of our media and governments, in the name of ‘affordable energy’. But there is nothing ‘affordable’ about an energy source that will literally cost us the Earth. We must make our society understand the true price of a future with fossil fuels, and foster a movement of movements so vast that no government can ignore it. At the end of the day, we’re fighting to survive. And that is what society actually wants.

Give What You Can 27 FEB | Worldwide A Debt For Climate rally in Kampala, Uganda. After World War II, Germany was deeply in debt. But in the interests of long-term peace, half of this debt, worth many billions of dollars, was cancelled by Western governments. Germany’s postwar economy was allowed to stabilise and flourish. Today, Germany has the 4th largest economy in the world, yet it persistently blocks debt cancellation for the Global South, forcing the region into a spiral of resource extraction to pay interest on loans already paid back many times over. On the 70th anniversary of Germany’s debt cancellation, Debt For Climate (D4C) launched a global wave of protest that targeted the nation’s finance ministry and its embassies around the world. Activists from dozens of countries and climate groups, including XR, joined the call for Global South debt cancellation and a just transition for the region. Rallies were held at embassies across Africa & South America, including in (clockwise from top left) Lusaka, Zambia, São Paulo, Brazil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Pretoria, South Africa. In Pretoria, South Africa, rebels from XR Vaal and XR Gauteng handed a letter of D4C demands to a German official outside the embassy, and were later sent a tweet by the Ambassador inviting them to schedule a future meeting. Meanwhile, in Panama, activists from Ya es Ya managed to catch the German Ambassador for a chat in the consulate elevator. In Berlin, activists blocked the entrance to the German finance ministry after the finance minister declined an invitation to join the rally outside. While some glued themselves to the ground, others pasted campaign posters to its walls. D4C actions also took place across Europe, including in (clockwise from top left) Paris, France, Belgrade, Serbia, Berlin, Germany, and Malmö, Sweden. But Germany wasn’t the only economic powerhouse to be called out for its financial bullying. In Paris, around 40 activists from groups including XR, Attac, and Youth for Climate blocked the French Finance Ministry, and even managed to get inside it. Their spectacular rally, which involved ‘heist’ costumes, chained activists, fake cash, and giant banners, attracted global media attention. In the end, 5 activists were arrested and held by police overnight. 13 - 14 FEB | Worldwide Rebels take part in a blockade of a private jet terminal in Brussels, Belgium. Photo: Brieuc Van Elst. The climate crisis is complex, but some of the ways to solve it are very, very simple. Like banning private jets. A four-hour private jet flight emits as much carbon as the average person does in a year. It’s a no-brainer. Which is why this Valentine's Day, 200 activists in a dozen countries across three continents declared their love for life on our planet by disrupting private jet companies, conferences, airports, and runways. Rebels glue themselves to a private jet runway in Milan, Italy. Actions included blocking private airport entrances with bikes (Schipol, Netherlands) and a boat (Luton, UK), gluing hands to runways (Milan, Italy), occupying airport counters and machinery (Cascais, Portugal), and gate-crashing the stage of a major aviation conference (Brussels, Belgium). Check out all the actions in this impressive video round-up. The wave of protest was part of the Make Them Pay campaign, a collaboration between XR, Scientist Rebellion and Stay Grounded. Other than banning private jets, the demands of the campaign are to tax frequent flyers, which is a socially progressive way to raise climate funds (80% of the global population have never set foot on a plane), and make polluters pay into climate loss and damage funds. Blockades at private airfields in (clockwise from top left) Seattle, USA, Christchurch, New Zealand, Melbourne, Australia, and Luton, UK. Awareness of the nauseating emissions of private jets is increasing, but that didn’t stop 1,040 private jets from flying in and out of Davos during the recent World Economic Forum. The Make Them Pay campaign, which only launched in November, will keep pushing the global elite to give up this unjustifiable luxury. A campaign spokesperson promised us they’ll be back soon with bigger and bolder actions to target private jets and the injustice of aviation. 22 FEB | Global Rebels rally at Standard Chartered Bank HQ in London, UK. Photo: Denise Laura Baker Thousands of activists around the world have taken to the streets to demand a halt to the banking sector’s involvement in the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), major oil infrastructure that will do immense social, ecological and climate damage. A #StopEACOP Global Day of Action, coordinated by 350Africa.org, saw non-violent protests launch in 19 cities against the three multinational banks who are financing the pipeline to the tune of billions of dollars. From Kampala to Paris, from Tokyo to Cape Town, an alliance of activists that included rebels as well as members of Sunrise, Stop Total, and Fridays For Future, rallied outside the offices of the ecocidal banks. Fridays For Future Nagoya protest outside the Japanese bank funding EACOP. In Johannesburg, South Africa, protestors brandished banners and placards outside Standard Bank, while in Tokyo, Japan activists congregated in blood-red jumpsuits at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). In London, rebels carried sections of ‘pipeline’ and stop signs to the main doors of Standard Chartered. There were no arrests on the day of action, even in Uganda, where the government has reacted to recent protests with extreme repression. If completed, EACOP will pump out billions of barrels of oil and an estimated 379 million tonnes of climate-wrecking emissions, making it not just a catastrophe for the neighbouring people and wildlife of Uganda and Tanzania, but a ‘carbon bomb’ that will further accelerate global climate collapse. University students in Kampala, Uganda join the #StopEACOP Global Day of Action. The pipeline, which is being driven by French fossil fuel giant TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, violates human rights and environmental protections - and the finance industry’s own Equator Principles (EPs) - by forcibly displacing tens of thousands of people, threatening community leaders and nature defenders, and destroying precious ecosystems. The pipeline’s route cuts through Uganda’s biodiverse Murchison Falls Park, where it will disturb water sources, wetlands and protected wildlife habitats. More actions from protestors in Uganda, Tanzania and around the globe, are being planned to stop this Big Oil monster-project in its tracks. 29 JAN | London, UK: Activists from more than 25 social justice groups – including XR, Just Stop Oil, and Netpol – gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice to highlight the failure of the justice system to protect the rights of both people and planet. Climate activists whose campaigning had cost them their lives or liberty were remembered. 9 FEB | Boston, USA: More than 50 rebels occupy the Massachusetts State House to demand that their governor stop all new fossil fuel infrastructure. After holding the space for 4 hours and attracting a lot of media attention, 14 rebels were arrested. 9 FEB | Bogotá, Colombia: The community of Marsella (which includes rebels) fails to stop the cementing over of a local park rich with biodiversity. They chained themselves to trees and tried sit-ins and hunger strikes, but were ultimately overpowered by large numbers of violent riot police. 10 FEB | Paris, France: Rebels supporting mass civil disobedience in Iran draped the Place de la République statue with a huge Iranian flag and danced in solidarity the day before global demonstrations against the Iranian regime. But the flag, inscribed with the motto of the civil resistance (Woman Life Freedom) was removed by police after just half an hour. Last year, a Ukrainian flag was left there by authorities for weeks. 26 FEB | Oviedo, Spain: Two young rebels run out of the Museum of Fine Arts with a painting in their arms, pursued by alarmed security personnel. Outside, the activists trample the picture, break its glass, stain it with red ink, shouting ‘No art on a dead planet’ and ‘Don't look at us, join us.’ The police are called. The action is a set-up. No painting has been stolen from the museum. ‘We didn't want to do this,’ the rebels said, ‘but we need your attention.’ 23 - 26 FEB | Sweden: Activists in 12 cities across Sweden, from Malmö in the south to Luleå in the north, took action to highlight the vital importance of the oceans during the UN negotiations on a global maritime agreement - which ended triumphantly with a historic new UN Oceans Treaty.

Read Newsletter XTRA So why are we recommending a book that isn’t about climate change? Because it is about courage, about principle, about strategy, and about justice in the face of injustice and long odds—Nobel-Prize laureate, Maria Ressa isn’t talking about the same problems we are (though of course they are closely linked), but she could be talking about the same solutions. Ressa was a leading Filipino journalist when the Duterte regime made it very clear she ought to shut up and sit down. She and her team did neither. This book is, in part, her memoir of how she became the person she is.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/03/10/newsletter-xtra-74/,"Welcome to Newsletter XTRA, where everything we couldn’t fit into the main Global Newsletter has its moment to shine. This month we cover actions in Berlin, Canberra, Cape Town, Christchurch, Copenhagen, Dhaka, Dublin, Kinshasa, Lake Garda, Le Havre, London, Melbourne, New York City, Palma, Sydney, Toulouse, and Turin. 18 FEB | Cape Town, South Africa: Red rebels in the frame! 3 MAR | Global: Young protesters across the world took part in the Global Climate Strike. Top: Edinburgh, Scotland. Centre: Dhaka, Bangladesh. Bottom: Sydney, Australia, where more than 2,000 marched. 17 FEB | Turin, Italy: Activists occupied the entrances to the headquarters of the main newspapers, La Republica and La Prensa, and the national television station, RAI, in Turin. For about two hours, at the entrances of the three buildings, a screen showed the interviews and surreal statements of various politicians, including the Italian prime minister. “These are the words of those who have denied the very existence of the climate crisis and have let people die at sea fleeing lands that have become uninhabitable,” explained one activist. ""So we decided to bring them inside the editorial offices, because this is what newspapers and television should be talking about."" 26 FEB | Gambia: Environmental activists held their quarterly beach clean-up along 65 km of the Gambian coastline, together with ‘impeccable’ partners from Banjul, Bakau, Fajara, Bijilo, Brufut, Tanji, Tujereng, Sanyang, Gunjur and Kartong communities. 3 MAR | Germany: 220,000 people took to the streets across Germany in rallies called jointly by FridaysForFuture and striking trade unions. Together they demanded radical climate action and a just transition for everyone. This is what democracy looks like! 15 FEB | Berlin, Germany: Last Generation activists blocked the Mühlendamm Bridge in the German capital. Twelve rebels sat down in the roadway, nine glued on. The group also poured concrete on the road, a novel tactic which a spokesperson described as a ‘more meaningful’ use of the material than building new climate-damaging infrastructure. 27 FEB | Canberra, Australia: Rebels disrupted business as usual at the Canberra headquarters of the fossil fuel lobby group APPEA (Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association). It was part of solidarity actions held across Australia to mark the 1-year anniversary of the catastrophic floods in northern New South Wales, the most expensive disaster in Australian history and in insurance terms the second most costly in the world in 2022. 28 FEB | Toulouse, France: A hundred rebels and other activists carried out an action at the head office of the Pierre Fabre Group to highlight the pharmaceutical giant’s involvement in the planned A69 Toulouse-Castres motorway. 27 FEB | Dublin, Ireland: Irish rebels denounced fossil fuel investment outside the offices of Black Rock while colleagues glued themselves to the revolving door of the office building. 20 FEB | London, UK: Together with activists from Plastics Rebellion and XR Fashion Action, rebels disrupt London Fashion Week. They poured fake oil from giant bottles of Coca-Cola (Fashion Week’s sponsor) and brandished banners green-shaming the corporation (it’s the world’s worst plastics polluter). 22 FEB | London, UK: Members of Christian Climate Action protested outside the Houses of Parliament against a proposed new coal mine in Cumbria. 14 FEB | New York City, USA: Showing their love of Earth on Valentine’s Day, rebels held a non-violent action to pressure Citigroup to stop investing in fossil fuel expansion. The bank is the world’s second-largest financier of fossil fuels after JPMorgan Chase, and has invested $285 billion in oil and gas since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Photo: Gabriele Holtermann 14 FEB | Copenhagen, Denmark: Activists from XR Denmark and Scientist Rebellion took direct action against Danske Bank to denounce its investments in fossil fuels. The bank’s carbon footprint is equivalent to the internal emissions of the whole of Denmark. Activists threw money and oil on the bank's floor. 21 FEB | Lake Garda, Italy: Two concerned citizens carried out an action on Lake Garda. The island of San Biagio, also known as Isola dei Conigli (Island of Rabbits), is about 200 metres from the lake shore. It is reachable on foot during the summer when the water level drops, but this year due to severe drought since last year San Biagio can be reached even in February. Lake Garda’s water level is more than 50-60 centimetre lower than its seasonal average and the regional Environment Agency has estimated a drop in water reserves for the region of 44%. 3 MAR | Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo: Climate strike activists demonstrate outside a TotalEnergies service station. 17 - 18 FEB | Le Havre, France: Rebels from several XR groups in Normandy demonstrated against the planned TotalEnergies gas terminal at the port of Le Havre. 22 FEB | Palma, Majorca, Spain: About 20 rebels and other activists held a rally to support - with criticisms - the Citizen Assembly of Majorca, which started deliberations in November 2022. They are concerned that limitations of the process mean the assembly will not be sufficiently transformative. 7 FEB | Melbourne, Australia: A colourful Rally for Forests held the state government to account for recent illegal logging in Victoria's precious remnant forest. An Australian Supreme Court order enforces the 'precautionary principle': If in doubt, don't log! 1 MAR | Sweden: A rebel mother and doctor wore a bright orange cape with the message ‘No more oil companies in ski sport’ to highlight the role of Swedish oil company Preem in sponsoring the 45 km Vasaloppet long-distance ski race.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/02/15/politiciansmakingbaddecisions/,"This guest blog post is written by Nick Gill, a project manager at the Sortition Foundation. Sortition Foundation campaigns to transform politics by upgrading our democracy to a system that works for the people. You can find details of some of their current projects at the end of this post. Whilst focusing primarily on the UK, many of the issues this post highlights are replicated in other countries. Problems such as these are at the root of Extinction Rebellion’s (XR’s) call for democracies to be upgraded through the use of citizens’ assemblies. XR’s third demand is for governments to create and be led by the decisions of citizens’ assemblies on climate and ecological justice. It is important to stress that this demand does not go as far as the replacement of elected politicians, which is something the Sortition Foundation advocates for in this post. However, XR’s rationale for wishing to involve ordinary citizens far more in the decision making process stems from a desire to address the same kinds of issues. Image by Bidyut Das from Pixabay ""Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner."" - James Bovard Chances are that you are reading this blog because you are scared, frustrated and angry about the climate crisis. Maybe you’ve just finished shouting at the radio after hearing another interview with a politician who should be taking responsibility for responding quickly and decisively but, instead, is mouthing platitudes and excuses. It’s tempting to conclude that all politicians are *?£$%s… But is that just an easy answer? Is there something deeper going on? Is it even possible that, by blaming politicians for our collective failure on various fundamental issues, we’re missing the fact that our political system itself is to blame? Let’s unpick this a little. There’s no getting past the fact that politicians are, by and large, very particular beasts. Many of them hail from the same strata of society, many share an elite educational background, many are independently wealthy. What makes this so damaging is that there is ample evidence that elected politicians vote largely according to their class interests, that the concerns of the bottom third of the socio-economic ladder are almost entirely ignored and that those of the middle third are only considered when they happen to be in alignment with the views of the upper third. Perhaps we are right, then, to conclude that it is the politicians themselves that are the problem. If we had different politicians, maybe we’d get different decisions being made. Isn’t this the whole point of the electoral process? Image by Leslie Andrachuk from Pixabay On the other hand, is it not true that we all have difficulty making decisions that threaten our own immediate self-interest? Speaking personally, this is a truth that I have arrived at after much sober self-reflection. And if this is a truth that we are willing to accept applies to (nearly?) all humans, then we must accept that it will be true of our politicians too, no matter which stratum of society they are drawn from. What are the implications of this truth for the way we run our democracy? We consider four consequences. Climate change is a classic example of an issue that undoubtedly requires that we collectively agree to suffer some possibly intense short-term pain in order to ameliorate our long-term prospects. But the people we are asking to make decisions on this matter are, in many cases, career politicians, whose professional survival is re-evaluated every 5 years at the polling booth. We need them to make decisions that potentially look very bad for ordinary people over that time span… but which will, we hope, be vindicated by the consequences that follow 10, 20 or 50 years into the future. Selling such a prospect is a hard ask, especially to an electorate who are naturally suspicious when the political class tells them they need to suffer (more austerity anyone?). A far easier option and an option that aligns much better with the politician’s own self-interest (and their party’s collective self-interest) is to stick to decisions with a fast pay-off. The irony is, of course, that it is the very mechanism we see as central to a functioning democracy – regular elections – that is actively preventing good decision making in this case. The electoral cycle presents further obstacles when one considers the resources required to win an election. Individual politicians and their parties must communicate their message in a media space that is immensely crowded. Crowded… and not at all impartial. Any prospective prime minister knows that a sympathetic editorial line from any of the major newspapers will depend on policy aligning with the declared interests of that newspaper (and their owners). In 1992, The Sun newspaper declared that “It’s the Sun wot won it” when John Major was voted back into office, and politicians have been mindful of this ever since. One can extend this analysis from traditional media to all of the modern machinery of the political lobby. For big oil and other major corporations, the electoral cycle offers a tremendous point of leverage: these corporations have the resources that will allow politicians to look after their own short-term interests and get back in power. A politician taking a more principled stance and turning their back on such resources is unfortunately likely to diminish their chances of electoral success. Image by Alexsander-777 from Pixabay We said at the start that, although it might be wrong to see politicians themselves as the root cause of our political problems, still the demographics of politicians (particularly around class, wealth and education) present a particular problem. In a different world, where our politicians were drawn from all areas of society and were genuinely representative of the society they served, the problem of our struggle with self-interest would be nowhere near as damaging. If each politician had a different self-interest and these self-interests all pulled in different directions, then the many forces coming to play on any given decision would accurately reflect the concerns and priorities of wider society. One might reasonably hope for a resolution that reflected the wider, collective interest. The problem as it stands, though, is that the self-interests of many politicians often align, even across party lines. First and foremost, our lawmakers are, by their very position, powerful and successful people. The status quo has worked for them, and worked spectacularly well. Threatening that status quo would be at odds with their own individual self-interest and with the corporate self-interest of the political class. We demand change from the very people that change threatens most. The alignment of self-interest is amplified by the adversarial nature of the Westminster system. The “debates” that we see in the palace of Westminster are not conducted with a view to widening understanding and learning on the issue at hand, rather they are an exercise in political point scoring, in shoring up the political capital of whichever politician or party can shout the loudest. In this context, it is rarely in the interest of any politician (or party) to allow their point of view to change or develop – witness the scorn poured on any decision maker who dares “make a u-turn”. One can imagine a different type of discourse – let’s call it deliberative – wherein the emphasis is on a free exchange of ideas and experience and shared learning on the topic in question. The aim of such a discourse would be to allow all participants to move together, from disparate positions representing their own self-interest, to a shared understanding of what might work best for the whole population. How do we solve a problem like democracy? It is an article of faith in modern society that our political system is the “least bad” of all the alternatives. There may be some truth to that but it doesn’t preclude the possibility that our democracy might benefit from a reboot. How do we stay true to democracy’s strapline of “government by the people, for the people” and yet also address some of the issues we have seen that arise from the interaction of the electoral cycle with our political class? The answer, we at Sortition Foundation would contend, is to take the “by the people” part of democracy more seriously. Representative democracy was developed in this country, first of all, to allow men of wealth to choose some of their number to take decisions on behalf of the rest of the nation. Over ensuing centuries, the people have forced the establishment to extend the franchise to working-class men, to propertied women, to all men and women over the age of 21 and then, in 1969, to all men and women over the age of 18. Image from http://www.hastingspress.co.uk/history/sufpix.htm, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons But despite these seismic changes, the “modern” system of democracy has always ensured that the people are kept at a healthy distance from the big decisions. Instead, we elect a representative every 5 years to speak on our behalf and make our decisions for us. We wrote “modern” in inverted commas just now because this system seems, to us, strangely antiquated. We’ve described above some of the practical, negative consequences of our traditional, representative democracy. In contrast, we look around us and see, for instance, how traditional media has been subverted and taken into the hands of individuals to create the media they wish to consume and we find ourselves asking why we can’t do the same with our politics? The Sortition Foundation proposes that the UK adopts a system of democracy based on `democratic lottery’, that is, on the random selection of people from across our country who come together as law makers for a fixed period to make decisions on behalf of us all. We contend that such a system would remove the priority of short-term decisions inflicted on us by the electoral cycle. Our representatives would serve a one-off fixed term for which there would be no re-election. We contend that vested interests would lose much of their leverage. By removing elections, we remove the need for our representatives to court those with wealth and resources. Lobbies that have worked for years to ensure that the wheels of change are stuck fast in place would find themselves subject to the will of the people, rather than the other way round. We contend that such a system would ensure that our representatives were drawn from all walks of life. There would be no Old Boys’ Club smoothing the ascent to power of the next generation of hand-picked smooth-talking career politicians. Instead, our decision makers would be the nurses, teachers, street cleaners, shop workers, retired people, school leavers etc. who make up the everyday people in this nation. Image from Sortition Foundation We contend that such a system would allow decisions to be made through a process of careful and thoughtful deliberation rather than through adversarial point–scoring. The wisdom and life-experience of ordinary people would inform decisions and allow nuanced debate and discussion to take place. Such a process won’t be easy – ordinary people can disagree with each other as much as politicians can! Nonetheless, these disagreements will reflect the differing points of view of the wider population. And in this regard the decisions makers in such a system will undoubtedly have a lot in common: the people who make decisions about the National Health Service (NHS), for instance, will be people who know that they and their loved ones will need that publicly funded healthcare now and as they grow older because, unlike our current political class, they don’t have the money to buy themselves the care that they need when they need it. Sortition Foundation exists to make the argument for a new, upgraded democracy. The ideas above are just a starting point – much greater detail can be found in a recent practical proposal for upgrading democracy in Scotland as well as in the resources listed below. We believe that the system we propose stands up to scrutiny and we invite you to join us in making the argument for a new democracy in the UK and around the world. This is an argument that we must win if we are to collectively take the decisions we need to take: on climate, on health and social care, on immigration, on equality and fairness and more. Our first target is the House of Lords – only when that falls and a House of Citizens rises in its place, will we, the people, truly be able to start, together, to actively change our future. We view the adoption of citizens' assemblies as advocated by XR as a positive step towards fixing our broken political system and improving decision making. Let’s transform politics and upgrade our democracy.

Photo: Judy Greenway In this issue: Degrowth | Lützerath vs Coal Mine | Finland’s Forest Blockades | Dear rebel, At the start of each year, the world’s corporate and political elites fly to Davos, a ski resort in the Swiss Alps, to discuss issues affecting the global economy. Whether covering the war in Ukraine, or Covid’s resurgence in China, the goal of each World Economic Forum session is always the same - ensure economic growth. That’s because the system that runs our global economy needs economic growth to survive. Under capitalism, economic growth must be exponential and eternal, and that has driven an ever-increasing plunder of the planet’s resources to produce profit. Now nature is unravelling, and the pollution of that plunder is altering our atmosphere. The demands of capitalism have directly led to the climate and ecological crisis. It just might you know. Photo: Stuart Walden Despite being most culpable for this crisis, the delegates at Davos will not countenance capitalism being replaced. Instead, they offer bogus theories (green growth!) overblown technology (carbon capture!) delusional schemes (space extractivism!) and horrifying fixes (geo-engineering!). Anything to preserve the privilege capitalism has brought them. One successor to capitalism that’s gaining mainstream attention is degrowth. Degrowth puts human need over mindless consumerism, public services before private wealth accumulation, and sustainability above a small coterie of billionaires. You can learn the basics in our Degrowth Q&A, go deeper with our Degrowth Must-Reads, and hear from a market-trader-turned-rebel in India who’s part of the degrowth movement in Degrowthers of XR. Finnish rebels trek across Lapland to stop the state from felling an old-growth forest. In Action Highlights we also report on the amazing occupation of Lützerath, where a broad activist alliance tried to stop a German village from being swallowed up by a coal mine; the rebel blockades deep in the snow-coated forests of Finland; and the chilling pre-arrests of Dutch rebels days before a peaceful road blockade. Whatever the rich and powerful in Davos might want, and whatever their media outlets might say, more economic growth is not a cure, it is a cancer, driven by the ecocidal logic of capitalism. Sustainable alternatives like degrowth are ready and waiting. People know what we’re against. It’s time to tell them what we’re for.

Donate What You Can 11 - 17 JAN | Lützerath, Germany Protesters reach the edge of the open pit mine that will ultimately swallow the village. Lützerath was once a small village in Western Germany. By now it’s been levelled to the ground, the result of a dirty deal struck between Germany’s government and its biggest energy company, RWE. In exchange for pledging to quit coal by 2030, the company was allowed to expand an open-pit coal mine that neighboured the village, and extract 280 million tons of coal lying beneath it. While the Green Party politicians behind the deal believed it an acceptable compromise, many green activists chose to disagree. Under the banner “Lützerath Unräumbar” (Lützerath Unmoveable), a vast alliance of rebels, other ecoactivists, anti-fascists, pensioners, church groups and more, descended on the village to halt the destruction. The state and RWE dispatched police and private security to clear them out. It took them over a week. Activists with Ende Gelände block a railway taking the coal to an RWE power station. Activists occupied treehouses, locked themselves to cars and wheelchairs, hid in underground tunnels, blockaded a railway taking coal to a nearby RWE power station, and even occupied another RWE open-pit coal mine in the region. But the resistance didn’t just have quality tactics, they had quantity too. Around 40,000 protesters marched through the village and up to the mine’s edge. Outnumbered and frustrated, the police became increasingly violent, randomly charging at protesters and beating them so badly that paramedics had to be called. Things got so severe that Gaia herself intervened, trapping troopers in the rain-soaked mud so that they could be ridiculed by a visiting monk. Police used pepper spray, dogs, and random beatings to clear Lützerath of protesters. Although the Lützerath resistance was ultimately defeated, the significance of the campaign for the German climate movement cannot be understated. This was not just about saving a village, it was about calling time on a cosy political culture of corporate compromise when it comes to the climate crisis. Lützerath is the same old story of global injustice - of selfish politicians and greedy corporations in the Global North putting short-term gains over the lives of millions in the Global South. But this time it has united environmental groups across Germany, and the coalition forged is hopefully here to stay. 15 - 31 JAN | Aalistunturi, Finland The Forest Movement roadblock campaign begins in the dead of night. After trekking on skis through the remote wilderness of snow-coated Lapland, four Metsäliike (Forest Movement) activists set up camp among the trees. Eleven more activists from Elokapina (XR Finland), Greenpeace, and other organisations quickly joined them, and as night fell, the group started setting up roadblocks. Their courageous campaign was an attempt to halt the logging of a 400-hectare expanse of old-growth forest. Although the area, Aalistunturi, is being considered for national park status by the Finnish government, the state-owned logging company Metsähallitus is busy trying to fell as many of its trees as possible. The roadblocks worked: the company’s machines were grounded and logging was halted. Police arrived the next evening and arrested seven of the activists plus an innocent bystander, taking them to a nearby city, where they were held for 20 hours. Forest Movement protesters keep up the roadblocks, and keep getting arrested. Undeterred, the Metsäliike rebels returned to set up more forest roadblocks, only for the police to again detain them. This pattern played out for several weeks, with the rebels receiving evermore public support and media attention. According to one protester, Metsähallitus has threatened to sue them for lost profits. The Finnish government has committed to protect 30% of its land to stop biodiversity loss by 2030. This aggressive state-sponsored logging of old-growth forests completely undermines these promises. In 2021, Finland’s land use tipped from being a carbon sink to being a carbon emitter, in large part due to mass deforestation. Elokapina’s rebels are currently planning their next moves, with new actions being prepared across the country. Follow Elokapina (XR Finland) on Twitter and Instagram 26 - 28 JAN | The Hague, Netherlands Rebels blockade the A12 highway and their new supporters look on from above. Every year, the Dutch government spends €17.5 billion on fossil fuel subsidies (three times more than what it allocates for climate policy). The Netherlands will be largely underwater if global emissions continue on their current path, so last summer rebels started blockading the A12 highway, which passes the national parliament, to try and force their government to stop the suicidal subsidies. Two days before its fifth and most recent A12 blockade, six rebels were arrested in their homes on suspicion of sedition or incitement. Without warning or explanation, they were taken to different police stations, had their phones confiscated, were held in custody for 10 hours, and banned from the A12 for three months. If the state intended to scare the rebels and tarnish XR, it badly backfired. The arrests prompted an outpouring of support from the public, and condemnation from dozens of prominent NGOs like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Rebels show appreciation for the love and solidarity from the crowds above. Even better, the solidarity carried over to the blockade itself. Thousands of people gathered in and around the A12, making it one of XR Netherlands’ largest ever blockades. While more than 1000 rebels sang songs and decorated the walls of the highway, an additional 2000 non-XR supporters stood in solidarity above them. After half an hour, the police started to carry the rebels away. It took several hours to clear the road, and more than 700 arrests. All rebels were released the same day. XR Netherlands has already announced it will keep coming back to the A12 until the government ends its fossil fuel subsidies. The next blockade is scheduled for March 11th and promises to be the biggest yet. Want to be part of the next A12 blockade?

Days earlier, they also confronted BlackRock’s Davos office to hold the giant investment fund accountable for their litany of financial and climate crimes. 20 JAN | Paris, France: 40 rebels and other activists blockade and repaint several buildings belonging to BNP Paribas. The French bank is the country’s worst fossil fuel investor, and a key financier of Total’s ecocidal African mega-pipeline EACOP. 21 JAN | Adelaide, Australia: Rebels chuck paint at and glue themselves to the offices of Santos, the energy giant sponsoring a major cycling race in the city despite poisoning the region with oil spills. It also plans to raze local forests for gas wells. 25 JAN | Muhanga, Rwanda: Activists with Scientist Rebellion hold a ‘Don't Gas Africa’ action in the city, demanding genuine decarbonisation from world leaders. 26 JAN | Kampala, Uganda: A Stop EACOP organiser is arrested while entering a public debate on the pipeline. Police surrounded the hotel where the event was to take place and blocked another key speaker from entering. The organiser was interrogated for hours, released days later, and must now report repeatedly to a police station. 1 FEB | Buenos Aires, Argentina: Rebels chain themselves to the gates of the President’s residence after he hires the ex-CEO of Syngenta as his chief advisor. The giant agribusiness company produces toxic pesticides like bee-killing neonicotinoids. What is Degrowth? Degrowth is a way to run our global economy that is sustainable and much fairer than our current system, capitalism. As well as offering a tantalising glimpse of a world where we live within our means and ecosystems can thrive again, the degrowth movement illuminates how capitalism is the root cause of the climate and ecological crisis, and explains the maddening inertia of our politicians when it comes to solving it. What’s so bad about Capitalism? Can’t we just tweak it? No. Capitalism requires every corporation, every industry, every national economy to grow. This economic growth must be exponential and carry on forever. Without it, shareholders don’t get profits, investment dries up, people lose their jobs, and we enter a recession. This is why nearly every government, whatever their political persuasion, champions economic growth. But this quest for constant growth has resulted in unfathomable pain and destruction across the 500 years that capitalism has evolved. Economic growth requires that value be taken with minimal compensation (or better yet stolen) from elsewhere, and in the real world that means seizing resource-rich lands and exploiting workers. The horrors of enclosure and artificial scarcity, of colonialism and transatlantic slavery, of corporate ecocide and greenwashing, can all be understood as serving capitalism’s growth imperative. And so can the climate and ecological crisis. Under capitalism, our economies churn through ever more resources, require ever more energy to do it, and produce ever more waste. We overshot safe planetary boundaries for this plunder decades ago, mostly to satisfy mindless consumerism in the Global North. If we stick with this system, not only will we extract our way to ecological collapse, we’ll also guarantee climate breakdown, because we cannot roll out renewable energy fast enough to quench our ever-increasing demand for energy. Instead, renewables will just keep being added to the energy mix, as is happening today. The material consumption of the global economy, all of it extracted from nature. The horizontal line represents the sustainable limit, which we rocketed past in 1999. So what’s so great about Degrowth? Degrowth doesn’t require the mindless pursuit of growth across all sectors. It allows for a planned reduction of energy and resource use to bring the economy back into balance with the living world, and does so in a way that reduces inequality and increases human well-being. Degrowth allows us to choose what parts of the economy we want to grow (clean energy, public healthcare) and scale down those sectors we don’t actually need (fossil fuels, SUVs). By only allocating resources and energy to what is needed, we can give ecosystems the breathing room to regenerate, and ensure that a just transition to renewables is possible. Our economy and civilisation will be in balance again with nature. By distributing wealth more fairly and investing in public services, we can ensure that workers in scaled-down sectors can be provided meaningful jobs and regenerative skills without fear of becoming impoverished. What about communities exploited by capitalism? Will they have to degrow? The climate and ecological crisis has been primarily driven by the excessive consumption of rich people in the Global North. This is where degrowth needs to have its greatest impact, not in the Global South, where many countries still need to increase energy and resource use to enable good standards of living and health. Much of the non-urbanised Global South is actually still tethered to low-carbon local economies that run in reciprocity with their ecosystems and well within sustainable resource and energy boundaries. The majority of our world does not need to degrow. Learn more about degrowth by checking out our special Degrowth Must Reads. Now you know the basics about degrowth, it’s time to dig a little deeper. Below is one book, two podcasts, and a couple of videos to fuel your journey of degrowth discovery. Less Is More: How Degrowth Will Save The World If you’re going to read one book about degrowth, make it this one. In a clear and captivating way, author Jason Hickel exposes the damage wrought by capitalism, demonstrates its inability to resolve the climate and ecological crisis, and offers a blueprint for degrowth. It even has a foreword written by two prominent rebels. Dissens Podcast: Jason Hickel (50 mins) The Less Is More author outlines the central argument of his book - that it's either degrowth for the rich or climate disaster for everyone. If you’re unsure whether Less Is More is worth your time, listen to this interview and then go hunt down a copy. Al Jazeera: Our Obsession With Economic Growth is Deadly (25 mins) Journalist Ali Rae investigates how capitalism drives people in the Global North to overconsume, exploits people in the Global South, and devastates our planet. The answer? Rejecting the idea of infinite economic growth and embracing degrowth! Digital Theme Week: Degrowth - South & North (1hr 26 mins) Indian environmentalists Ashish Kothari and Shrishtee Bajpai discuss how Global South communities are resisting the capitalist system, promote a theory of radical eco-democracy, and position degrowth as just one of many complimentary solutions. My Climate Journey: Degrowth with Timothée Parrique (1hr 8 mins) In this podcast episode, the French researcher in ecological economics is quizzed about degrowth by a sceptic of the theory who wants to learn more. Ishan (far left) with fellow rebels in Bangalore. Growing up in urban India, I had little connection to the wild, though I did learn that plastic bags were bad at school, which led to quarrels with my mum. It wasn’t until I’d graduated and taken a sought-after role as a financial market's trader that my inner closet-environmentalist started to surface. I yearned to know more about the world around me and started attending a local Greenpeace group, as well as research local issues like the burning lakes in Bangalore. I finally quit the financial world after 2 years of “success” and moved to a place called Auroville, an off-grid eco-township built on deforested land in southern India. What started off as a small trip of self-discovery became an 11-month immersion into all-things local, low-emission, and sustainable. I returned to the city and got my hands dirty working for a social enterprise in waste management. Spending long hours pushing big corporations towards zero-waste, I saw how doing the bare-minimum or worse, greenwashing, was the norm, and began to grasp just how vast and systemic ecological destruction really was. Around this time I read about Extinction Rebellion, and was drawn to their use of creative disruption and mass mobilisations to highlight the climate crisis. I became part of a small group planting the first seeds of XR India, and within no time there were chapters in half a dozen Indian cities. I was a co-initiator of XR Bangalore, and after a roadshow launch we held climate talks, helped arrange a climate-week bringing together diverse voices, and went on climate strikes with our local Fridays For Future allies. It was a time of great activity, but also mounting eco-anxiety and fracturing personal relationships. At a national XR meeting in Goa, we decided to enter a period of pause and reflection to reshape our movement. The pandemic struck a month later. Around the time XR Bangalore launched, I started reading about degrowth. With my background in finance, solving this crisis via an economics revolution made a lot of sense. It wasn’t just a valid critique of the system we were all part of, it also paved the way for the climate movement to fight for something, not just against something. I joined a degrowth collective in Europe, and realised that while degrowth policy is absolutely necessary in the Global North, the movement still didn’t have a blueprint for how it might work in the Global South, where so many still haven’t experienced a quality standard of living. For me, the key is not enforcing a homogenised or colonising economic model on everyone, but instead understanding the needs of diverse local communities, and using degrowth to transform hyper-globalised economies to ones that are mostly-localised. When the Indian farmers’ protest turned violent two years ago, the government started rounding up young environmental activists, claiming they were agitators backed by foreign powers. Some of my rebel friends were detained and interrogated for weeks. It was a shocking time, but also a galvanising one. We wrote articles, raised legal funds, and had important intergenerational conversations with other Indian activists about how to safeguard our communities from an overbearing state. If you know (or are) a rebel somewhere in the world with a story to tell, get in touch at xr-newsletter@protonmail.com All We Can Save is a collection of essays and poems by climate feminists. The book has multiple stated missions. One objective is to provide a platform for people who are too often marginalised—women, especially women who are not white. The editors also state explicitly that patriarchy is part of the cause of climate change, and so the book aims to use a feminist lens to deconstruct climate change at its root. Finally, the editors maintain that a distinctly feminine leadership style exists and is sorely needed in our current crisis. Whether that last is true is debatable, but let’s leave that aside for now. Most of the essays and poems do not mention feminism explicitly, though. They are mostly personal writings by women about their lives in this wounded world of ours. Some directly offer advice on activism, communication, and related topics. Others indirectly offer advice, describing the author’s struggle with a given issue and the solution she found. Most offer a clear and honest look at a beautiful world in pain. If you ever feel like nobody really cares for the planet as you do, this book is a reminder that you are not alone. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/01/25/big-oils-plastic-apocalypse/,"Hidden in my kitchen cupboard is a vast pile of shopping bags. They are my secret shame; the result of depending on a deeply problematic material that has invaded every aspect of my life: plastic. At first glance, a pile of plastic bags collecting in my closet may seem benign, but merely glancing is the problem. Because plastic is so common, so omnipresent and familiar, it has pretty much become invisible. It is only when we focus on plastic that we realise how completely it has infiltrated our lives, becoming a glaring physical embodiment of a devastating dependency. An extremely useful material—one that has helped us advance far beyond our wildest imaginings—it’s no wonder we got hooked. How to unhook? That’s an enormous challenge. As you read on, know that no part of the globe is plastic free, an extremely troubling reality as the vast majority of plastic is made from petrochemicals, which are, in turn, made from fossil fuels. More plastic production means more fossil fuel extraction, which only serves to deepen the climate and ecological crisis we face—and we are creating far more plastic today than ever before. Approximately five trillion plastic bags are produced each year globally, with many discarded in landfills or at sea. What does that mean over time? It is estimated that a single bag takes roughly ten to twenty years to break down. Eventually, each bag decomposes into microplastics, which have been found at the bottom of oceans, floating in the air to eventually fall in rain or snow, nestled in our food and water supplies, and even lodged within our bodies. The plastic bag you use today could one day resurface in the bodies of your great, great, great, great grandchildren. Plastic pollution is causing devastating harm, especially in the Global South, and is a growing crisis that needs to be dealt with immediately. So, who’s to blame? On one side there’s Big Oil, a seemingly unstoppable goliath making obscene profits from our addiction to fossil fuels, which are used to make plastic. To maintain its stranglehold on the world, the oil and gas industry spends vast amounts of money both lobbying politicians and creating sophisticated marketing campaigns, all to undermine any efforts to halt the climate and ecological crisis... and these multinational companies fight tooth and nail to protect their shareholders' dividends. On the other side there’s you, me, and everyone who believes this planet should be protected, not plundered. We must learn, spread the word, and fight back. To comprehend the depth and consequences of our plastic addiction and how we became hostages of the fossil fuel industry, we need to understand how and why plastic came to dominate our lives. First created in the nineteenth century, synthetic polymers, or plastics, proved to be a revolutionary material, eventually becoming vital for America during World War II. Ten years later—due to its low cost and malleable nature—it moved from the battlefield to our backyards. A modern-day miracle that would free humankind and propel us into the future, plastic soon became fundamental to daily life, and from the 1960s forward, the global plastics market became increasingly profitable. In 2021, it was worth $593 billion, with forecasted growth to $810 billion expected by 2030. It is the versatility of plastic that has led to such prodigious figures. Plastic helps ensure the supply of clean water via PVC pipes, it keeps food fresh and safe to eat, and, owing to plastic’s high strength-to-weight ratio, its reduced packaging results in lower transportation costs, increased energy savings, and potentially lower transportation emissions than other materials. Plastic has also revolutionised the medical industry by helping to improve safety standards as well as lowering the cost of providing medical treatment. Take a look around you now. Aside from bags, count the products you use on a daily basis that contain plastic. Can you imagine doing without your car, smartphone, laptop, television, refrigerator, ice trays, headphones, toothbrush, shampoo, light bulbs, electric sockets, carpet, and wallpaper? Even our clothing—60% of it!—is plastic. (Think polyester, acrylic, nylon.) We use so much because it is useful and cost effective, but also because we are regularly encouraged to buy the latest version of our favourite products. Consumption and disposal have become fundamental cogs in the wheel of modern life, with the planned obsolescence of products now forming a major part of marketing strategies for many twenty-first century companies. By 2050, the petrochemicals used to make plastics are predicted to be one of the main drivers of global oil consumption. Unfortunately, pushing plastic production to the fore comes with a heavy cost. According to a 2017 study, “8.3 billion tonnes of plastic have been produced over the last seventy years, with 6.3 billion tonnes being tossed away. Only 9% of this has been recycled, with 79% ending up in landfills, and the remaining 12% being incinerated.” Currently, roughly 400 million tonnes of plastic is created each year, with a massive amount being thrown away, mainly in the form of single-use plastic packaging. We therefore need to examine the roots of single-use packaging so that we can truly understand how damaging it is to our environment and ecosystems. Here, then, is your plastic-packaging primer. Prepare to be blown away by things that get thrown away but, alas, do not go away. Fish trapped in a plastic bag: Photo by Naja Bertolt Jensen on Unsplash It’s 1956 in New York City. At the Society of the Plastics Industry conference, Lloyd Stouffer— editor of Modern Plastics magazine—declares ‘‘The future of plastics is in the trash can.” Here’s how he explained it a few years later: “What I had said in the talk was that it was time for the plastics industry to stop thinking about ‘reuse’ packages and concentrate on single use. For the package that is used once and thrown away, like a tin can or a paper carton, represents not a one-shot market for a few thousand units, but an everyday recurring market measured by the billions of units. Your future in packaging, I said, does indeed lie in the trash can.” Single-use plastics are disposable items packaging everything from medicine to food to water bottles: everyday objects we all use and throw away. Approximately 130 million tonnes of single-use plastics are produced each year, with all but 2% coming from freshly produced plastic, which in turn comes from… yep: petrochemicals. Most single-use plastic will be thrown away, with anything from 5 to 13 million tonnes dumped into small nearby waterways each year. A large proportion of this plastic finds its way to the world’s oceans via municipal and larger rivers such as the Mississippi and Mekong. From there, the plastic travels into local coastal systems, where most of it washes back to clog up shorelines, leaving about 10% ending up in deep oceans. Over half a million tonnes of plastic are ferried to oceans by the offshore fishing industry in the form of plastic fishing nets, lines, buoys, and packing containers—and left there. Called Ghost Gear, this terrible mass of plastic disrupts delicate ocean ecosystems, from the tiniest molluscs to turtles mistaking plastic bags for jellyfish, to the largest marine animals. A dead whale found on a Scottish island in 2019 had a horrific pile of plastic in its guts. It all adds up to the death of marine life on a massive scale, now, and for centuries to come. Recent research has also shown that plastic pollution is a factor in amplifying heavy metal pollution in the oceans, which then infiltrates the food chain with potentially devastating effects for marine life and humans. Albatross at Midway Atoll Refuge: Photo by Chris Jordan (via U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Headquarters), Uploaded by Foerster, CC BY 2.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en, via Wikimedia Commons If plastic, and especially single-use plastic is such a toxic material, how did it come to dominate almost every facet of life on planet earth over the last seventy years? The answer in part lies in the extremely sophisticated and sustained campaigns of mass manipulation conducted by the oil and gas and plastic industries. Greenwashing, an intentionally deceptive manoeuvre, is when companies present themselves as being more environmentally conscientious than they really are. In some cases, they not only continue selling products that damage the environment, but even hinder demonstrably verified ways of revving up recycling. It is corporate sleight of hand designed to shift attention away from their own complicity in deepening the climate and ecological crisis, a tactic those industries have been deploying for decades. In the US, awareness of environmental damage caused by single-use plastics first began in the 1960s. That’s also the decade the word “recycle” entered popular usage (it was coined within the oil industry in the 1920s!). By the mid 60s, said coinage made a robust rebound, carrying with it the promise of actual coins: people could bring their used bottles back to stores for recycling, earning five cents for each return. Called bottle bills, this immediate, remunerative incentive for recycling on a massive scale—from villages to states—was a win-win. To this day, wherever such legislation exists, recycling rates are significantly higher than places without them: sometimes more than twice as high. But bottle bills and the like have a huge and powerful opponent: the beverage and packaging industry, which includes “many of the non-profit groups they control”. As soon as any such recycling plans have popped up, companies have quickly mobilised their money for a fierce and fact-free two-pronged rebuttal. Privately, they lobbied politicians. Publicly, they made their case on TV screens, creating iconic ad campaigns shifting blame from themselves onto consumers. Keep America Beautiful (KAB), a non-profit organisation founded in 1953 by the American Can Company, Philip Morris, and Coca-Cola among others (and today partnered with organisations from Dow, McDonalds, Pepsico, and Anheuser-Busch, to the Plastics Industry Association), along with the Ad Council, deftly reassigned guilt to its customers by developing a series of advertising campaigns that still resonate today. Two of KAB’s notable creations are the term “litterbug” and the iconic 1970s “Crying Indian” public service announcement. Both placed the responsibility for the increasing mountain of waste onto the public rather than the industries that deliberately began pushing single-use plastic a few decades earlier. Corporate greenwashing still happens today, with Coca-Cola, the world’s biggest “corporate plastic polluter”, sponsoring COP27 in one of the most cynical recent examples of industrial misdirection. The “don’t be a litterbug” campaign made a comeback in Malaysia in 2012. A few years later, in 2019, Shell announced a headline-grabbing “$300m fund for investing in natural ecosystems”, a well-timed and effective publicity stunt, drawing attention away from the monstrous revenues they generate by extracting and refining fossil fuels. The oil and gas industry has also placed the responsibility for solving greenhouse gas emissions onto consumers, urging us to be aware of our own “carbon footprint”, by using a carbon calculator. This shift of responsibility and focus, along with ExxonMobil’s suppression of the reality of burning fossil fuels nimbly offloads all guilt firmly onto the public for buying their exponentially profitable products: petrol and plastic. The value of the plastic packaging market is predicted to increase to $492 billion over the next seven years, and it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the desire to protect this ocean of money lies at the root of the industries’ persuasive messaging that we, not they, are the cause of plastic pollution. However, despite the petrochemical and oil and gas industries’ attempts to convince us that two plus two is five, the amount of plastic polluting our oceans and land increases daily, with even our clothes contributing to this plague of plastic particles. This destructive cycle must be broken soon, for as devastating as the near future that awaits is, it already is the cause of horrific inequality, poor health, and environmental destruction in the Global South. Making Money from Plastic Bottles - New York: Photo by Hope Lourie Kilcoyne Understanding who the heaviest plastic polluters are is tricky due to a lack of international data; however, wealthier countries are among the biggest producers and consumers of plastic. They are also home to some of the largest plastic-producing petrochemical companies. Until recently, their role in contributing to marine plastic pollution in the oceans was overshadowed by the now-debunked claims that Asian countries were the heaviest plastic polluters in the world. Some things, though, are easier to debunk than others. For example, although people in more affluent countries may believe all their plastic waste is being recycled, because the process is inefficient, expensive, and difficult - this is not the case. Instead, countries including Australia, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands claim to be recycling plastic, while the truth is they’re actually exporting a large portion for someone else to deal with. Until 2017, China imported huge quantities of plastic waste, which over time became increasingly difficult if not impossible to recycle, instead being dumped in landfills, and accelerating China’s own increasing domestic waste problem. Confronting an environmental and health catastrophe that had to be addressed, in 2017, the Chinese Government implemented the National Sword programme, which banned imports of certain types of plastic. However, this policy created a problem for many richer countries, as they now needed to place more rubbish into local landfills while simultaneously finding new markets for their plastic waste. Inevitably, this meant sending their toxic waste to countries with less well-developed recycling industries. Doing so has resulted in a climate justice crisis, with less wealthy nations becoming sacrifice zones for the richest, often without their consent. Historically, plastic waste has been exported to poorer countries around the globe, including Kenya, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. As happened in China, these countries face issues with dealing with their own waste. Within these countries, it is the poorest of the poor who have to deal with it. This can be seen in Nairobi, Kenya, home to Dandora Municipal Dump Site, where the most marginalised Kenyans live, work, study and play amidst their wealthier compatriots’ rotting rubbish. Dandora - Dumpsite from above, photo by Falkue, CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0, via Wikimedia Commons What is life like day to day for the destitute? They live next to toxic landfill sites, sorting through hazardous waste as workers in unregulated informal recycling industries. Here they breathe fumes from incinerating plastic, which not only releases more carbon dioxide, but also emits black carbon, or soot, which has been linked to a host of devastating diseases. The people working and living in these diabolical conditions are exposed to dangerous contaminants, and consequently develop a plethora of “health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, mental health conditions, and respiratory illnesses”. Inevitably, women are the hardest hit. These communities and others—including poor or racially marginalised groups—have not meekly accepted this state of affairs. It has taken time, and it is an uphill struggle, but over the last forty years or so, coalitions to change their circumstances have emerged. The environmental justice movement rose from protests against the dumping of toxic soil in the poorest Black communities in America during the 1980s; and subsequent studies showed that race was indeed a critical factor in how the most dangerous types of waste were dealt with. However, they have faced an uphill struggle in the face of increasing plastic production and consumption, and as the climate crisis has deepened, it is clear that the deep social injustice they have experienced is being amplified on a global scale, including Louisiana's ""Cancer Alley”; Orosi, California; Palestine; Somalia; and Kenya. People Working on a Scrapyard, Chattogram, Chittagong Division, Bangladesh. Photo by Mumtahina Tanni. Humans consume too much, so much that our addiction to plastic is helping create what could potentially be a new geological age called the Anthropocene. We have created an awful mess, one that is hard to justify, and even harder to clean up. However, some governments are implementing policies that restrict the use of plastics. Leading the charge are African countries, from Tanzania to Rwanda, which are protecting themselves from the harm of plastics. The European Parliament also passed legislation in 2021 that banned a variety of single-use plastics. In March 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly adopted a mandate to begin negotiations for an international plastic pollution treaty, which is currently being negotiated. In January 2021 the Basel Convention, which controls the “movement and disposal of waste”, was amended (despite opposition from the United States government), so that now the export of plastic waste needs to be approved by the countries importing it—a very big deal. However, the oil and gas industry will not give up its golden goose without a fight. Over the last fifty years, Big Oil has made $2.8 billion a day in profits, and the recent shale gas boom in the US along with Chinese and Middle Eastern investment in plastics infrastructure represent their next get-rich-quick scheme. These companies will continue lobbying politicians and fighting any threats to their bottom line, as moving away from using plastics—especially single use plastics, along with the inevitable shift towards renewables—presents them with an existential threat. They will also call upon their government allies, who have received fossil-fuel funding while facilitating massive oil and gas subsidies, to keep the cash flowing. These politicians will also protect their interests by enacting laws that treat us, the ordinary citizens who are desperate to save our future, as dangerous extremists. Never forget that the real extremists sit in plush boardrooms and stalk the corridors of power. We need to be informed, counter their misinformation and tell the truth about plastic waste. We must act now, keeping pressure on our governments to enact legislation that will turn the tide. We also need to go beyond conventional, broken politics to inclusive participatory systems in which citizens have a say and stake in our collective future. Blindly trusting the politicians and industry leaders to lead us out of the mess they created will not work; we need to take the future into our own hands. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/01/13/global-newsletter-72/,"In this issue: COP15 | XR France vs Forever Chemicals | Stop EACOP | Dear rebel, 96% of all the mammals on Earth today are either human or our livestock. 4% are wild. Humanity is wiping out the biodiversity of this planet, and we are doing it with terrifying speed. Animal populations worldwide have declined by 69% since 1970 (by 94% if just looking at Latin America and the Caribbean). 1 million plant and animal species face extinction. Last month, governments converged in Montreal, Canada for two weeks to try and reverse the largest loss of life on this planet since the dinosaurs. The UN summit on biodiversity, known as COP15, resulted in a new set of biodiversity targets to meet over the coming decade, known as the Global Biodiversity Framework. Rebels discuss biodiversity loss with students in Tanzania, one of many seminars held across Africa during the COP15 negotiations in Montreal. This Framework has been called a ‘major milestone’ by some campaigners, a ‘failure to stop mass extinction’ by others. Find out more about its contents, and the rebel actions launched during its negotiation, by heading to Action Highlights. You can also hear from a Canadian rebel who has campaigned passionately for biodiversity and attended the summit in Humans of COP15, then read more reactions to COP15 and stories about biodiversity loss in Must Reads. Rebels enter a toxic chemical plant that is poisoning a whole region of France. This issue, we also report on how hundreds of rebels invaded a toxic petrochemical factory in France that is leaking terrifying ‘forever chemicals’, and we dedicate Solidarity Corner to the brave activists of Stop EACOP who are being persecuted for protesting against a monstrous crude oil pipeline that will run across East Africa. Whatever you feel about the biodiversity targets that emerged from COP15, none of them are legally binding. We live in a world where trade deals are protected by law, but deals to ensure the survival of a million species are merely voluntary. Human overconsumption has spread extractivism, pollution, and habitat destruction all over our planet, and extinguished nearly three quarters of its life. And it’s growth-dependent capitalism which demands that this overconsumption continues. When we live in a world where international biodiversity deals are legally enforced, and trade deals must yield to their demands - that will be a world where nature has a fighting chance. We must dedicate our activism this year to bringing that world about.

Donate What You Can 7 - 19 DECEMBER | Montreal, Canada & Worldwide After two years of pandemic-induced delays and a change of host country, governments from 195 countries finally arrived in Montreal for COP15, the UN summit on biodiversity. As negotiations began on the biodiversity targets that would define the decade, rebels in some of the most biodiverse regions of the world launched actions to pressure their governments and spread awareness of the biodiversity crisis. Rebels in Argentina staged a blood-smeared protest outside a courthouse in Córdoba to demand their government stop the relentless extractivism and construction in the region, and address local water shortages. In Misiones, the province with the greatest biodiversity in Argentina, rebels painted messages on the motorway walls that act as death traps for endangered animals. More than 5000 are killed each year, including jaguars, ocelots, bears and tapirs. Rebels rally in Córdoba & Misiones, Argentina (top), on the streets of Medellín, Colombia, and by the National Service of Protected Areas in La Paz, Bolivia (bottom). Across Africa, including in Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda, rebels held seminars with farmers, students, and women’s groups to discuss the causes and impacts of biodiversity loss, and spread awareness of sustainable cultivation practices as well as the need to conserve wild spaces. Rebels in Zimbabwe (welcome, XR Zimbabwe!) marked COP15 by planting trees on a deforested part of a mountain sold to a stone-mining company. The quarry was green lit by Mutare city council last year even though it endangered local residents and their water supply. Rebels discuss preservation of wetlands in DRC, combating desertification in Gumel, Nigeria (top), ending deforestation in Iganga, Uganda, and planting trees on Danagamvura mountain in Zimbabwe (bottom). In Montreal itself, activists from Collectif Antigone (who have close links with XR Montreal) helped unfurl a giant banner telling world leaders to stop following the whims of ecocidal billionaires trying to influence global policy on biodiversity. Indigenous people make up 6% of the world’s population, but protect 80% of the world’s biodiversity, and so Indigenous Leaders converged in Montreal to ensure their rights were enshrined in COP15’s agreement. After two weeks of negotiations, a Framework of four goals and 23 targets was agreed to by all parties. The final text recognised Indigenous leadership as key to recovering biodiversity and called for Indigenous people (as well as all women, children, and disabled people) to be part of national decision-making. A Namblong woman from West Papua, Indonesia explains how a palm oil company is destroying her forest homeland at a press conference in Montreal. Photo: Toma Iczkovits/Greenpeace Elsewhere, though, the Framework has serious problems. Many of the targets are written in vague or compromised language. Even the headline target of preserving 30% of land and sea for nature by 2030 doesn’t explicitly exclude extractivism from those protected areas. Corporate schemes like offsetting are also included in the targets, enabling ecocidal industries to continue exploiting what’s left of our biodiversity for profit. And in a repeat performance of COP27, the Global North is refusing to give adequate funds to the Global South to stop planetary breakdown. The Global South is rich in biodiversity, and protecting it takes money. Negotiations very nearly broke down over this issue, and the final pledge of $30bn per year is far from enough. Climber-activists unfurl a banner telling billionaires to back off from biodiversity policy in central Montreal. But the biggest problem with the targets is that they are not legally binding. Governments are expected to go away and draw their own plans to implement them, then report back at COP16 in Turkey next year, echoing the failed process that followed the Paris Agreement. The last time governments set UN biodiversity targets, in Japan in 2010, they failed to meet a single one. Biodiversity has long taken second place to the climate crisis on the world stage, despite both crises arising from human overconsumption and a global economic system reliant on that overconsumption. Until this ecocidal engine is dismantled, there is no credible way for our atmosphere to decarbonise, nor for our planet to sustain a healthy biosphere.

Hundreds of rebels from XR Lyon celebrated the holiday season by targeting a local plant of the petrochemical giant, Arkema. The multinational corporation is a major producer of perfluorinated chemicals. Perfluorinated chemicals are highly toxic and carcinogenic, and accumulate in soil and water thanks to their near indestructibility - earning them the nickname “forever chemicals”. Testing shows that the plant’s chemicals have contaminated both the local area and its inhabitants. A recently aired documentary revealed that the water supply of 200,000 people contained dangerous concentrations, as did the breastmilk of local women. Rebels hold a die-in outside the regional watchdog that has ignored Arkema’s ecocide. Rebels dressed in protective overalls and facemasks stormed the plant site, just south of Lyon, banging drums and chanting as security quickly mobilised to evict them. Meanwhile, a second rebel group held a die-in outside DREAL, the regional environmental watchdog that has ignored the plant’s chronic pollution for decades. Around 300 rebels participated in the actions, and although police made 20 arrests, no rebels were charged. Importantly and unusually, the French government gave two responses to XR Lyon’s actions. Though not supportive of the disruption, they did agree to start negotiations within Europe to further regulate environmental pollutants. In the US, Arkema was successfully convicted by the state of Michigan for contaminating its water and environment with perfluorinated chemicals. In France, not only are there no convictions, but Arkema is given tax-breaks to continue its ecocide. XR Lyon will be closely following any regulatory developments and maintain pressure on the French government to ban these Earth-killing chemicals.

The sentence will be appealed in March. Read her first interview since release. 14 DEC | London, UK: HSBC announces it will stop funding new oil and gas fields (although it excludes its soon-to-be-sold operations in Canada). The move comes after Lloyds, another British banking giant, announced an end to ‘direct’ funding of fossil fuel projects in October. It’s not the end of all fossil fuel financing by the big banks, but it’s a start. Protest works, people! Partial victory! 24 DEC | Makassar, Indonesia: A rebel addresses world leaders as he stands in floodwater outside his house. His message: the climate crisis is happening today. Loss and Damage is real. Act now. 25 DEC | Kaduna, Nigeria: A Christmas rebel flash mob called for their government to stem widespread poverty in the country after months of extreme flooding, and reduce the rampant tree-felling which is destroying biodiversity and making the flooding worse. 26 DEC | Buenos Aires, Argentina: Police detained eight rebels after they peacefully protested outside the offices of oil fracking company, Equinor. The rebels used washable paint to write messages on the glass skyscraper before staging a sit-in outside its entrance. The rebels were later released after being issued with an infraction report, meaning they will face a court summons. 1 JAN | UK: Despite the provocative headline, XR UK has not quit, just temporarily shifted its tactics, moving away from actions that disrupt the public to focus instead on actions that encourage mass participation. The move is part of the build up to ‘The Big One’, starting on 21st April, when XR UK hopes to gather 100,000 people around the Houses of Parliament in London.

Read Newsletter XTRA A rebel demands an end to ecocide outside Córdoba’s courthouse, Argentina In this COP15 edition of Must Reads, we have two verdicts on the final Framework, two startling stories of recent and ongoing corporate ecocide, an investigation into the rapid and largely hidden decline of insects, and the true solution to all this loss - degrowth! Greenpeace: A Bandage For Biodiversity A pithy analysis of the COP15 agreement that lacerates the final text for containing ‘false solutions’, ‘greenwashing’, and ‘protections on paper but nowhere else’. Resilience: Biodiversity - Targets and Lies This analysis of the COP15 agreement co-authored by an ex-spokesperson of XR UK and a green economist argues that it will take much more than non-binding long-term targets to reverse the biodiversity crisis. Guardian: The Coal Mine That Ate an Indian Village The story of how the Adani Group insidiously destroyed a village and razed a pristine forest to get hold of $5bn worth of coal. A text-book case of corporate ecocide, and one that COP15 should have prohibited for good. Wired: The Quest to Defuse Guyana’s Carbon Bomb An inspiring report on how a former BP lawyer is trying to stop Exxon from drilling for oil off Guyana’s shoreline. A potential landmark case for dismantling the oil industry. Reuters: The Collapse of Insects This beautifully presented article investigates how insects are dying off at a frightening rate, and why these tiny, mysterious organisms are vital to all life on Earth. Nature: Degrowth Can Work Researchers in ecological economics call for degrowth - the scaling down of destructive and unnecessary forms of production to reduce energy and material use, to enable rapid decarbonization, and to end ecological breakdown. It was Bill McKibben’s book The End of Nature that first woke me up to the climate and ecological emergency, back in 1989. I was so shocked by the title, I ran out to get a copy. This book made so clear and concrete what we were doing to our world – what we were destroying. I’ve been following the development of XR since it emerged in 2018, and am part of XR Québec. In December 2022, along with about 18,000 others, I attended COP15 in Montreal, not far from my home in Canada. It was a mixed bag: passionate young activists, Indigenous campaigners, and scientists, as well as political and corporate figures apparently unable to think beyond our ecocidal status quo. Although there was a lot of promising language, I’ve been referring to COP15 as the “make a wish” biodiversity conference. Almost 200 participating nations adopted four overarching goals and twenty-three targets to hit by 2030, but the major problem – and the reason I use the term, “make a wish” – is that these are not legally binding. The agreement is a set of “ambitions”. So, the agreement itself is only the start. We now need, urgently, to enforce these targets. We need to act radically and fast. Another problem is the vagueness and inadequacy of some of the targets. For example, number three is about conserving ‘at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, and of coastal and marine areas,’ by 2030. But this is too vague, and ‘at least 30%’ is not enough. One of my heroes, the late biologist and writer Edward O. Wilson, said we need to ensure that at least 50% of nature is protected. It was good to see that defending nature protectors – hundreds of whom are killed every year – was included in the agreement, but again, without a legal framework, it’s just wish-making. A crucial question for me is: how do you inspire a love for nature in other people? Can you educate others to feel that? I used to run music festivals, where I incorporated conversations about biodiversity and climate into the programming. It made perfect sense to me, and I believe climate and ecology should form a core part of our education throughout school and university, and should permeate every part of our culture. I also believe we need to work one-to-one, and in our local communities, and to rapidly set up Citizens’ Assemblies across the world, as XR demands, while continuing to participate in civil disobedience wherever possible. Underlying all this, we must incorporate nature into our understanding of ourselves in the world. And we need to ask: what restrictions are we going to place on the rich world in order to protect life on Earth, including all human life? It is an unpopular question, but one that demands an answer.

Police were waiting. We are living through an unprecedented climate crisis thanks to the overconsumption of fossil fuels. If there’s one thing we really don’t need, it's 1,445 kilometres of brand-new oil pipeline. The East African Oil Pipeline (EACOP) is brought to you by French oil giant TotalEnergies, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and the Ugandan Government. It is supposed to stretch from oil fields in Uganda to the port of Tanga in Tanzania. Its effects on local communities and the environment would be disastrous. A large coalition of activists has organised to stop EACOP by protesting, taking legal action, and trying to block the financial flows and insurance of the project. The harsh reaction of the Ugandan government shows that they have struck a nerve. Police bundled nine activists into jeeps and imprisoned them for nearly a week. In October, several brave students started a protest march through the capital Kampala demanding that their government stop EACOP. At least nine were arrested and detained in Uganda’s maximum security prison for nearly a week. Now, they are facing charges of inciting violence. “They exercised their right to peacefully protest, and were arrested”, says a Stop EACOP activist, who works under a pseudonym for her safety. The Ugandan government does not treat all protests equally. When students and school children from across Kampala 'unexpectedly’ marched in favour of EACOP and against an EU resolution that condemned the pipeline, the protest received extensive police protection. The nine students were eventually released on bail, but now face trumped-up charges. “Over 100,000 people would or have been displaced by the pipeline,” the Stop EACOP activist explains. “Most of them are farmers, whose livelihoods depend on their land. I know many families from western Uganda who lost their independence.” “Now they must cultivate other people’s land. That affects their income, their ability to send their children, especially girls, to school. And we see similar things happening in Tanzania.” When it comes to fossil fuel projects, social and ecological damage go hand in hand, and it’s no surprise that the pipeline also poses a huge threat to many natural reserves, each a biodiversity hotspot and home to endangered species. It will also affect vital freshwater reserves like the Lake Victoria basin, which provides food and drinking water for 40 million people. And finally, there’s the carbon emissions from the crude oil that would flow through the pipeline - 34 million tons per year. Join the fight to Stop EACOP! Act locally and globally to bring down this pipeline. No More Fairy Tales is a collection of short stories that all showcase characters either developing climate solutions or living in climate solutions, or both. Some are set far in the future in worlds very different from our current reality. Others have a more or less contemporary setting. Each ends with a footnote suggesting further reading on the solution suggested by the story. Although the stories are not all from the same author, and some are excerpts from longer, previously published works, they do interlock—reading through the collection, you find characters living in solutions proposed by the characters in previous stories. Fiction written to deliver a message is seldom as well-realised as fiction written for its own sake, and indeed some of these non-fairy tales read as a little simplistic—and yet they are engaging, accessible, and relatable. Some contain real gems. And while essays proposing the same solutions might be dry or dull, these stories do the job in a way that is not only clear and effective, but also genuinely enjoyable to read. You care about the characters and hope they make it. Then you hope we make it. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2023/01/13/newsletter-xtra-72/,"Welcome to Newsletter XTRA, where everything we couldn’t fit into the main Global Newsletter has its moment to shine. This month we cover actions in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Norway, Italy, Senegal, USA, Rwanda, Spain, and more… 3 DEC | Kinshasha, DRC: Rebels urge the world to agree a new global biodiversity framework at COP15 and their government to mirror its key objectives around habitat conservation and restoration. 5 DEC | Trondheim, Norway: 15 scientist activists with Scientist Rebellion are banned from the city and 2 are arrested after a roadblock in solidarity with Stopp Oljeletinga who are calling on the Norwegian government to end all oil exploration. 5 JAN | Germany: While the excavators of energy company RWE are being defied in Lützerath (left), a tiny town being wiped out for a new coal mine, people gathered across Germany to protest against the destruction of their future. Rallies were held in Berlin (right), Leipzig, Hamburg, and many more cities across Germany. Police prepare to dismantle a tripod blocking an approach road to Lützerath. 21 DEC | Düsseldorf, Germany: 14 scientists and students block the entrance to a regional Ministry of Economic Affairs in Düsseldorf in solidarity with Lützerath. They spread charcoal across its entrance and pasted scientific studies of the climate crisis on its walls. “If Lützerath falls, Germany will break its climate targets and continue on the highway to climate hell. If Lützerath stays, it could be the beginning of the end of the destructive fossil fuel combustion system.” 12 DEC | London, UK: Ocean Rebellion rebels welcome delegates of the Marine Environment Protection Committee, which was meeting at the UN International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The IMO continues to allow cargo ships and oil tankers to burn Heavy Fuel Oil at sea, which is extremely toxic. Photo: João Daniel Pereira 12 DEC | Stockholm, Sweden: 12 rebels were charged at the Stockholm District Court for a peaceful sit-in in a Volvo showroom where they demanded an end to fossil fuel subsidies. In a double irony, Volvo is both facing charges for climate crimes, and joining other Swedish corporations to launch a global climate appeal. 14 DEC | Ndiarogne, Senegal: Rebels visited the village of Ndiarogne near Dakar to work with a local women’s group to teach the community permaculture, good waste management, and other cultivation techniques to ensure their gardens and local mangrove forests thrive. They also raised awareness of the climate crisis among the village youth. 15 DEC | Massachusetts, USA: Ten rebels are arrested after occupying a private jet operator for four hours. 16 DEC | Kigali, Rwanda: XR Kigali planted trees on the outskirts of the city and held a seminar on how human activity is destroying biodiversity and why we must value all life. 16 DEC | Imo, Nigeria: Rebels took to the streets and the airwaves to demand an end to ecocide. A rebel appeared on state radio to discuss the climate and ecological crisis and there was a road march through the state. 20 DEC | Valencia, Spain: Red Rebels protest a new motorway being constructed through Valencia. 23 DEC | Madrid, Spain: Activists from Futuro Vegetal protest outside a major meat processing company and block a main road in Madrid. They called for the Spanish state to stop subsidising the meat industry and promote plant-based alternatives. Futuro Vegetal also sabotaged the largest slaughterhouse in Europe, which has the capacity to kill up to 30,000 animals each day. 2 JAN | Rome, Italy: 3 rebels from Ultima Generazione are arrested for using fire extinguishers to spray orange paint over Palazzo Madama, the house of the Italian senate. The group is trying to wake up their politicians to the ongoing ecological collapse and potential genocide to come. 2 JAN | Forests of Sweden: Rebels from Oslo and Finland as well as other activists disrupt hunters killing wolves. The hunt is legal despite wolves being endangered. “We are spending several weeks making noise, flying drones, driving cars on the forest roads, going ahead of the hunters. Let's stop this madness together.” 2 JAN | Utrecht, The Netherlands: Rebels at Utrecht Central lie on the cold ground. “The world will become a place without people if we continue like this.” 8 DEC | Munich & Berlin, Germany: Air traffic comes to a standstill at two of Germany’s largest airports thanks to a group of Letzte Generation activists sticking themselves to runways and wandering through airport grounds. Police were informed in advance to ensure the safety of all involved. 21 DEC | Hamburg, Germany: Rebels block a bridge holding a banner saying ""Climate protection is not a crime"" in solidarity with activists from Letzte Generation (Last Generation) who are being imprisoned for non-violent resistance. 6 DEC | Torino, Italy: Rebels got to work constructing a two-metre high wall outside the entrance of the Regional Environment Department. ""Climate Crisis. Closed Due to Default"" was written on the bricks. 17 DEC | St Ives, UK: Three rebels dressed as crows broadcast the biodiversity message as COP15 closes. It is critical: in the past 60 years, 69% of all non-human life has gone from our planet.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/12/16/global-newsletter-71/,"A Scientist Rebellion activist protests outside COP27 in Egypt. This Issue: COP27 Actions & Analysis | Ban Private Jets | XR South Korea | Dear rebel, COP27 was a disaster. Yes, world leaders agreed to a ‘Loss and Damage’ fund, meaning the Global South has finally been promised compensation for the destruction caused by Global North emissions. But yet again, world leaders couldn’t agree to phase down fossil fuels. This fundamental failure, despite nearly three decades of negotiations, cannot be underestimated. It underlines the fact that while limiting global warming to 1.5°C is still technically possible, politically it is not. Climate scientists have known this for some time, and more and more are speaking out. The graph shows the relentless rise in atmospheric CO2 levels and global temperature. There are dangers to delivering such devastating news. Some bad-faith negotiators at COP27 were already using the verdict to try and water down the Paris Agreement. And hubristic articles are lining up to tell us how technology and geoengineering will cool the planet ‘later’. But by sticking to the fairytale that 1.5°C is possible, we let policymakers hide from their failures and delay the radical action necessary to save lives and ecosystems. And we fail to follow our first demand: to tell the truth. You can read about some of the beautiful rebel actions around COP27 by heading to Action Highlights. Find out more about why the conference failed, and what this means, by visiting Must Reads. Finally, you can hear from a Rwandan rebel who actually went to Sharm El-Sheikh in a special Humans of COP27. DRC rebels rally in Shasa market during COP27. The country has unfairly inherited debts taken on by its former colonial occupier, Belgium. Ultimately, the climate and ecological crisis is a crisis of human overconsumption. And no one overconsumes more than billionaires. The irresponsible elite emit more than a million times more carbon than the global average, and rebels targeted them by blockading private jets around the world. Find out more in Action Highlights. There you can also find an update from rebels in South Korea, who are nearing the end of an epic court battle over their protest against a vast new floating airport. Rebels and Scientist Rebellion activists shut down a private jet terminal in Washington, USA - one of a wave of similar actions across the globe. As 2022 comes to a close, it’s time to face some hard truths. 1.5°C is over, and intolerable suffering is on its way. COP has been co-opted by greenwashers and oil lobbyists, and cannot deliver the policies needed to minimise that suffering. Nothing less than total economic transformation is necessary now, meaning a move beyond the infinite growth model of capitalism to the sustainable model of degrowth. It is up to us, as part of a movement of movements, to normalise this idea, rather than the competing fantasy that technology and geoengineering will eventually save the day. Every day we wait, the suffering increases. We don’t have time for fairytales.

Donate What You Can 6 - 20 NOV | Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt This year’s COP was hosted by a military dictatorship, sponsored by the world’s worst plastic polluter, and staged in a walled-off resort that limited protest to designated zones. It’s fair to say expectations were low. But that didn’t stop rebels across the world from demanding action from their politicians. Billed as the COP where ‘Loss and Damage’ would dominate, rebels in the Global South made sure that the destruction already being caused by the emissions of the wealthiest states wasn’t forgotten. In Nigeria, rebels from XR Muslims interviewed rice farmers devastated by the recent floods. Crops, homes, and even lives have been lost as rivers burst their banks more severely every year. The farmers are also being taken to court for defaulting on bank loans that they have no way of paying. Farmers in Jigawa, North West Nigeria, discuss the devastating floods this September. In DRC, rebels teamed up with Debt For Climate to stage a performative dance in a market to the east of the country. Activists demanded that the IMF, the World Bank, and former colonial occupiers Belgium cancel historic debts and support communities who are protecting vital ecosystems like the nearby Virunga National Park. Rebels in South America also mobilised as COP27 progressed. XR Rosario teamed up with other Argentinian activists (and a polar bear) to rally at a Coca-Cola plant. As well as being the world’s No.1 plastic polluter, the COP27 sponsor is also the worst polluter of the local Paraná river. Women rebels across Colombia spoke out about the damage extractivism has caused to their lives and country. They held public assemblies and marches demanding the cancellation of unjust debts that induce further ecocide. Rebels in Argentina rally with a polar bear stuffed with plastic Coca-Cola bottles retrieved from the local river. A small delegation of African rebels made it to Sharm El-Sheikh to take part in the constricted protests around the conference itself. While they joined a global alliance of activists and indigenous leaders to demand climate justice, solidarity marches were held in cities across the world. COP27 did end with an agreement to establish a Loss and Damage fund. But this fund is still hypothetical, with the tough questions of who pays and how much still unanswered. A similar promise was also made all the way back at COP15 that is still to be delivered on. Even worse, countries still couldn’t agree to commit to a phase down of fossil fuels. After 27 conferences and nearly three decades of negotiations, there has never been a formal COP agreement to reduce the world’s use of oil and gas. A solidarity march in London, one of many across the world (top left). Indigenous grandmothers at COP27 (top right). XR Serbia protest outside the UN building in Belgrade (lower left). Rebels from across Africa unite in Sharm El-Sheikh (lower right). A major reason for this colossal, likely genocidal, failure is the torrent of fossil fuel lobbyists in negotiations, on the conference floor, and even platformed by nation states. COP27 saw a huge rise in fossil fuel lobbyists - with more attending than any national delegation. With COP28 set to be held in the UAE, a repressive petrostate with worse per capita carbon emissions than the US or Saudi Arabia, that trend is set to continue. To paraphrase the UN Secretary General, a fund for Loss and Damage is essential, but means little if we allow the climate crisis to turn an African country into desert. The psychopathy on display by the global elite is chilling, and one can only wonder how long Global South countries will consent to a process that condones it. For more analysis of COP27 and its implications, check out this issue’s Must Reads. 5 & 10 NOV | Netherlands & Global Of the 700 protesters involved, 500 successfully made it onto the runway tarmac. More than 500 protesters, including Dutch rebels and Greenpeace activists, stormed Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport to block private jets on the runways. The action was in response to a government announcement that the airport would be limited to 440,000 flights per year, but that the private jets of the high-emission elite would be exempt. The scale of the action was made possible by the growing XR network in Amsterdam, with 400 newly-trained rebels involved. These numbers proved crucial: the police had no way of stopping such a mass of people. Bikes that initially served as a means of transportation were used to form a dynamic blockade and distract police. Rebels locked on to 13 jets and confined many more to their hangars. Usually, 40 jets take off per day at the site. Not a single one managed to during the 8-hour action. This is what a Dutch blockade looks like! Photo: Reuters/Piroschka van de Wouw. 413 rebels were arrested, but all were released the same evening, despite some heavy-handed tactics by the police. Given the involvement with Greenpeace and the strong anti-elite messaging, the action was certainly a public success. “The collaboration with Greenpeace showed that you can build this movement of movements…even if you have differences, it can lead to greater actions. Strategic alliances can pack a punch,” one rebel organiser said. The positive response was not limited to the general public: 5 days later, 2 of 3 parties in the Amsterdam city council voted to push for both a ban on private jets and a kerosene tax at Schiphol Airport, of which they hold 20% of the shares. Victory! The action also served as the spark for a coordinated global action disrupting private airports in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK, and USA. Rebels block private airports in Farnborough, UK (top left), North Carolina, USA (top right), Ibiza, Spain (bottom left) and Værnes, Norway (bottom right). Hundreds of rebels, including more than 100 scientists from Scientist Rebellion, blockaded 11 international private airports to demand a ban on private jets and a tax on frequent fliers. The actions were part of the Make Them Pay campaign, focused on addressing climate injustice and making the highest carbon emitters pay for their pollution. Private jets are 14 times more polluting than commercial aeroplanes and 50 times more than trains. “Five years ago, the majority view was that it was unacceptable to be an activist and to speak out if you were a scientist,” said a NASA scientist and rebel involved in the blockade of a private jet terminal in North Carolina, USA. “I think the majority view now is you probably should be doing that because the science is so frightening.” Find out more about the Make Them Pay campaign and join their telegram channel. MAR 2021 - Present | Seoul, South Korea Police struggle to remove rebels from the Democratic Party HQ. The banner reads: “The Democratic Party is a climate destruction party.” What would you do if your government decided to build a new airport? What if multiple studies showed that this airport would bring no economic advantage and cause huge ecological destruction? And what if the government, fully aware of all that, decided to fast-track the project anyway for reasons of pure political prestige? That was the scenario faced by XR South Korea back in early 2021, and their response was to launch the country’s first ever lock-on protest. A small group of rebels targeted the then-governing Democratic Party’s headquarters, chaining themselves to its entrance, and climbing onto the canopy above it. The police reaction was harsh, as the video of the action shows, and so were the courts. The six rebels involved were collectively fined an eye-watering $15000. But XR South Korea saw their action as not only justifiable but necessary, and they fought back. They appealed the court's decision. Police roughly restrain a rebel before he’s able to lock-on to the building’s entrance. This led to a lengthy and exhausting trial process. After six court hearings across two years, the rebels now face a final hearing before sentencing on January 17th. “We are not expecting the fine to be dropped, but we want to raise awareness of the issue and let people know that they are being deprived of democratic participation”, said a South Korean rebel involved. XR South Korea have created a petition in English to encourage global solidarity for the rebels on trial, and show the government that their ecocide will not be ignored. Rebel defendants and supporters attend the 3rd trial of their appeal in August. Activist culture in South Korea is growing, which is important as it ranks as the 8th highest carbon emitting country in the world. “XR Catholics has recently been founded, and we are expecting the launch of Animal Rebellion in South Korea soon”, said our rebel source. At the moment, however, XR South Korea actions are on hold due to a case of gender violence within the movement. The group is going through a painful process of reflection and rebuilding to ensure safety for all. “We didn’t pause because actions and building a safer community aren’t compatible, but because it’s necessary to stop the harm from inside and heal first. How else could we tell the world to stop its self-destruction and start taking care of each other?” Sign XR South Korea’s Global Petition and follow them on Instagram or Facebook. 11 NOV | Cape Town, South Africa: Rebels deliver a hard truth: believing that Carbon Capture & Storage will allow us to continue burning fossil fuels without damaging our planet is the same as believing that magical unicorns will suck carbon from the air. 15 NOV | Lilongwe, Malawi: 40 Scientists, Researchers and Environmentalists have delivered a petition to the President of Malawi urging his government to ensure that Africa’s needs are met during COP27. 21 NOV | London, UK: After COP27 was overrun with fossil fuel lobbyists, rebels joined a coalition of protesters to visit the offices of companies and organisations linked to the fossil fuel industry. One of the 13 sites targeted for the ‘cut the ties’ actions was insurance company Arch, which pulled out of insuring EACOP a week later. Victory! 25 NOV | Melbourne, Australia: Rebels marked Black Friday, a glorification of overconsumption, by staging a naked protest against fast fashion. There were rebel protests against Black Friday all over the world - including Germany, France, & Ireland. 3 DEC | Bologna, Italy: Days after at least 8 people died in a mudslide on the Italian island of Ischia, rebels from Ultima Generazione staged a protest before the painting ‘The Massacre of the Innocents’ in Bologna’s national gallery. 5 DEC | Berlin, Germany: Days before the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) starts in Canada, rebels demand their government spearhead a plan to stop the dramatic extinction of life on our planet. In the last 50 years, over 70% of the world's population of wild animal and plant species have been wiped out. So many actions happened this month, we can’t fit them all into one newsletter.

This month’s Must Reads explore the debate over declaring 1.5°C dead, the failures of COP27, terrifying developments in solar geoengineering, and the real solution, shrinking the ecocidal aspects of our economy aka degrowth… Byline Times: Stop Pretending We Can Limit Global Warming to 1.5°C. Earth system scientist James Dyke argues that we must confront the fact that we will overshoot 1.5°C. Otherwise, we will lose public trust, and delay genuine solutions like rapid decarbonisation and radically reducing our energy and material consumption. XR UK: What Happened At COP27? (49 mins) XR Founder Clare Farrell and Scientist Rebellion climate scientist Dr Charlie Gardner discuss the inaction of COP27, the end of 1.5°C, the vast suffering this will cause, and the danger of letting this failure validate further inaction under a revised 2°C target. New Yorker: Dimming the Sun to Cool the Planet is a Desperate Idea… Environmentalist Bill McKibben summarises the increasing efforts to develop solar geoengineering, the unpredictable results, and the terrifying potential side effects. Al Jazeera: Our Obsession with Economic Growth is Deadly. (25 mins) Journalist Ali Rae investigates how our economy drives people in the Global North to overconsume, exploits people in the Global South, and devastates our planet. The answer is rejecting the idea of infinite economic growth, and embracing degrowth. COP27 was the first COP I have attended in person. I saw it as an opportunity to gauge how much (if any) progress has been made, and to meet with other activists. However, I was anxious about what the situation would be like in Sharm El-Sheikh, in light of the Egyptian government’s oppressive attitude to civil protest. I was relieved to find that we activists were able to cooperate and express ourselves relatively freely. I cooperated in actions and discussions with Scientist Rebellion, XR, and other groups from around the world. My main focus for actions was on cancelling Global South debt, and supporting Loss and Damage. My fellow rebels and I staged sit-ins at hot-spots in the conference complex, holding placards, and raising our voices in expressions of solidarity and demands for climate justice. One message we repeated often was: ‘We meet for all, not for one’. It was interesting to hear from leaders like Mia Mottley, António Guterres and Al Gore. It was encouraging to hear Al Gore say openly that every new fossil fuel investment is taking us above 1.5 and toward catastrophe. However, talking to activists in DRC about the oil fields still being opened there (among others across Africa) was depressing: their activism hasn’t changed that situation. I left the Red Sea coast with some hope for a future based on renewables. But I also know that this will demand huge change, and we are out of time. In 2022, Nigeria, Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, among other African nations, suffered severe droughts and floods, including while COP was taking place. These destroy lives, homes, and agriculture, which is a major source of food and employment. We must urgently take our foot off the fossil fuel pedal. If we do not, we will create millions more climate refugees and destroy millions more lives. Now, COP15 is taking place in Montreal, and I would love to carry out actions to communicate the biodiversity crisis. We have already lost so many species, and I feel that I have lost much of my ecological identity: I don’t see as many animals as I used to where I live, and the trees I grew up with are disappearing. In XR Rwanda, we don’t have the funds to stage these actions – but my team and I are planning one anyway, because we must speak out. After COP27, I reflected on a story I had heard a rabbi tell at an interfaith meeting. A boy was holding a bird in his hands, and he asked his mother, “Is it alive or dead?” She said, “I don’t know, but the life of the bird is in your hands.” This stayed with me. It seems to describe our situation very well. If you know (or are) a rebel somewhere in the world with a story to tell, get in touch at xr-newsletter@protonmail.com Katharine Hayhoe’s latest book offers salvation or disappointment, depending on your perspective. On balance, I recommend it, but it’s not all things to all rebels. Dr. Hayhoe is an American climate scientist who has built her career in fine-grained modelling for community-level planning. She also speaks on the importance of climate action. As an evangelical Christian, she has cultural kinship with many climate sceptics, and she uses that kinship to reach out and communicate. Saving Us is a practical how-to on finding kinship, on cutting through apathy and fear. Meet people where they are, use effective, research-based communication methods, and more people will jump on board—and maybe we can make real changes together. That’s the hope. What Dr. Hayhoe doesn’t address is that systemic injustice is part of the picture. People with power who are actively hostile to climate action are part of the picture. The advice offered in Saving Us will not, all by itself, save us. That’s the discouraging part. But other tools exist, and we can and should use all of them. And if you find yourself in conversation with someone who seems sceptical, it will be good to have a manual on finding common ground. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops.

The protest finished with a die-in on the city’s streets. 14 NOV | Glasgow, Scotland: Rebels break windows at Barclays bank’s new offices. The bank is the biggest funder of fossil fuel in Europe and provides money to develop Rosebank, a vast, untapped oil and gas field in the North Sea. The action was one of over 100 to take place at Barclays branches across the UK. Thousands of rebels took part, and 25 were arrested, including 3 just for handing out leaflets. 14 NOV | Tel Aviv, Israel: Phoenix Insurance Company invests pension money in fossil fuels, so rebels blocked the entrance to their offices and glued themselves to the floor. 18 NOV | Melbourne, Australia: Rebels rally outside the office of their local politician to demand more protection for koalas and the forests they live in. The marsupials are now listed as endangered in parts of the country. 18 NOV | Berlin, Germany: XR joins other groups to protest against the imprisonment of 19 Last Generation activists in Munich. One prisoner went on hunger strike, and many activists joined him in solidarity. All 19 activists were finally released a week later, after nearly a month in custody without trial. 19 NOV | Bologna, Italy: Rebels occupy a major bridge for 6 hours, converting it into a social space for yoga and dancing. The action was part of a three-day rebellion against the city’s regional government, which is busy expanding motorways instead of addressing the climate crisis. 23 NOV | Leiden, Netherlands: Rebels take (naked) action at Naturalis Biodiversity Center. The rebels stood next to a mammoth skeleton to highlight the threat to humanity posed by the climate and ecological crisis. 28 NOV | Europe & North America: Tyre Extinguisher activists in 8 countries deflated the tyres of 900 SUVs in the biggest action against high-carbon vehicles in history. 28 NOV | Boston, USA: Rebels hold a funeral procession to mourn the inevitable loss of life after the failure of COP 27. Participants carried ecologically-themed light boxes to the home of the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. 28 NOV | London, UK: Just Stop Oil activists stop for a drink at a pub after around 80 police officers and 6 police vans followed them on their ‘slow walk’ through the streets of London. The new strategy of slowly walking with traffic rather than blocking it is just as disruptive but less arrestable - the perfect recipe. 28 activists are still in prison in the UK, and police have started arresting journalists covering their actions. 30 NOV | Trondheim, Norway: Four Just Stop Oil activists block a main road, calling for the Norwegian government to stop all oil exploration. 2 DEC | Sandton, South Africa: XR Vaal join with other climate justice groups to march on the energy company Sasol during its AGM.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/12/13/land-reclamation-environmental-catastrophe/,"Palm Jumeirah is a set of artificial islands located in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). More sand than you could even imagine was dredged from the sea floor to mould the islands into a palm tree shape. The crescent-shaped breakwater was built using blasted mountain rock. These islands were not created out of necessity. They were designed to cater to the global rich. Glitzy hotels dot the skyline, luxury villas line the beaches and opulent restaurants cater to the 0.1%. A penthouse lounge can have a bar-scene-from-Star-Wars vibe, albeit with $100 steaks and $1,600 bottles of alcohol. By day yachts and speedboats surround this cesspool of decadence. By night the clubs drip with champagne. The endless calls for “growth, growth, growth” are driving projects like Palm Jumeirah around the world. But this is creating environmental disaster and immiserating human livelihoods in the process. Palm Jumeirah photo by giggel, CC BY 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons Land reclamation is the process of constructing fabricated land from oceans, seas, rivers and lake beds. Water can be drained from shallow areas, or the bed raised, making the land available for development. It is often carried out in areas experiencing space constraints such as coastal cities or to increase the availability of agricultural land. The UAE is mostly desert, and cities such as Dubai have seen population increases as the economy expanded. It may not seem unreasonable for these places to broaden their natural limits to provide accommodation and livelihoods for their people. But land reclamation has severe environmental consequences. It threatens those same livelihoods it’s supposed to serve. Our planet relies on these coastal ecosystems for biodiversity and greenhouse gas absorption. And at the root of this artificial expansion is remorseless economic growth. Land reclamation caters to a global economy that requires more shipping, more flights, more oil and more stuff. Palm Jumeirah is an egregious example of a regime that washes its reputation on the shores of a tourists’ playground and batters the environment in the process. The Gulf has a unique marine ecosystem due to its shallow waters, arid conditions and warm sea temperature. The coral reefs and mangrove forests support fish, dugongs and turtles. This ecosystem already exists in extreme conditions and it doesn’t take much for a tipping point to be reached. Researchers found the water temperature around the Palm had increased by 7.5%. Reefs degrade in these conditions. Warming waters also cause sea levels to rise and the irony is that the Palm cannot handle the expected rises that will occur over this century. Palm Jebel Ali is a project with similar aims to Palm Jumeirah but 50% larger. Over 8 km2 of natural reef habitat was destroyed during its construction. These projects prevent normal water flow from the sea which has serious consequences for marine life. Sea turtles, for example, have become endangered by reclamation. Sea turtle image from rawpixel Another irony is how this land reclamation is being funded through fossil fuels. The UAE became rich by selling planet-destroying oil and gas and then used this money to further wreck the natural environment. Worldwide, land reclamation is often specifically for fossil fuel extraction or to enable its trading. Carbon-intensive infrastructure such as airports, shipping and factories, and agricultural development, are also driving the creation of artificial land. Rotterdam has Europe’s largest seaport. Over 40% of the goods passing through are oil, coal and gas. The port stretches over 40km and projects into the North Sea through the reclaimed Maasvlakte area. When construction began in 1965 the De Beer nature reserve was one of Europe’s most important breeding grounds for the seabirds of the North Sea. But the development of Maasvlakte destroyed it. Reclamation also caused the disappearance of important ecological features of the landscape. Riverbanks were turned into quays and concrete debris. Maasvlakte 2 expanded the port by reclaiming land adjoining the original Maasvlakte. It was initially rejected on environmental grounds and only proceeded thanks to compensation agreements for the ecological harm it would cause. Land reclamation in Singapore has enabled the country to build one of the world’s busiest ports. Much of the global supply of oil passes through here. The Jurong Port tank terminals boast of their state-of-the-art facilities for oil refinement. Before reclamation Singapore had thriving ecosystems of wetlands, mangroves and coral reefs. Now the local environment has been devastated by the artificial expansion of the coastline. 95% of mangroves and 60% of coral reefs are lost, partly driven by the fossil fuel trade. Species like the dragonfly Indothemis limbata are critically endangered. The environmental crimes committed in the Niger Delta have been well exposed. Thousands of oil spillages have laid waste to forests and wildlife. An investigation concluded that Shell was complicit, not only in this ecocide, but also in the murder of protestors campaigning against it. Much of the oil and gas development has depended on land reclamation. Exploration, laying of pipelines and wellhead construction have required dredging of swamps and clearing of vegetation. Oil spill at Goi Creek, Nigeria, August 2010. Credit: Friends of the Earth Netherlands With one of the longest coastlines in the world and a high population density, China has embarked on huge land reclamation projects. Shanghai built an airport on tidal flats (level muddy surfaces next to an estuary) in the Pudong district and artificially expanded nearby islands to develop its port. The wetland ecosystem in Pudong has collapsed with only 8.9% remaining. Reclamation activities around Chongming island in the city led to massive declines of Tundra swans. In 1986–1989 3,500 were counted compared to only 51 in 2000/2001. To give larger vessels access to Shanghai’s port, large amounts of the seafloor were dredged at the mouth of the Yangtze River. This resulted in an 87.6% decrease in the number of species of animals living on the seafloor. Much of China’s east coast has been reclaimed for port development and industry. The Shuangtaizi Estuary of the city of Panjin saw a loss of 60% of its wetlands over 15 years. Qingdao port development destroyed valuable ecosystems. Reclamation projects in the South China Sea caused species like juvenile Mugil ophuysen fish to suffer mass mortality. Factories and manufacturing enterprises line the reclaimed land of Tokyo Bay. Large parts of the ecosystem have been damaged by the concrete and landfill required for development. Mantis shrimp have almost disappeared and attempted conservation efforts have failed to lead to the species’ recovery. Across the Sea of Japan, South Korea’s Saemangeum land reclamation project has turned 400 km2 of sea into land for factories, golf courses and water treatment plants. This area used to be an important feeding ground for globally threatened birds and has destroyed the wetlands they rely on. The spoon-billed sandpiper and spotted greenshank are now facing extinction. A spoon-billed sandpiper, Tareq's photography, CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Indonesia and Malaysia have seen rapid clearing of peatlands for agriculture. These areas are permanently flooded and characterised by soils made up of dead and decaying plants. This accumulates over centuries and forms peat, an important carbon sink. Indonesia has 210,000 km2 of peatlands and 7% of Malaysia’s total land area contains peat soils. Over 90% of these areas are seeing declines and 40% of Indonesia’s mangrove forests have been lost. Often peatlands are reclaimed through controlled fires but this can lead to devastating greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Peat is 90% water and 10% organic matter, and highly flammable. When on fire it can smoulder underground for weeks. In 2015 major fires in Indonesia released more greenhouse gas emissions than Germany’s annual emissions and triggered respiratory illnesses in half a million people. Land reclamation is also for the exploitation of palm oil. Indonesia and Malaysia are the world’s largest producers of this product. And it’s in everything. The goods we see in rich country supermarkets: laundry items, toiletries, lipstick, ice cream, instant noodles; all contain palm oil. Japan and South Korea have also reclaimed land for farming. The Isahaya Bay wetland in south-west Japan was one of the country’s largest. It was a refuge for migratory birds, and 282 species of animals were identified on the seafloor. In 1997, completion of a dike drained the wetland making it available for agriculture. This wrecked the ecosystem by worsening sea water quality and soil. Many species including mudskipper fish have become extinct. South Korea’s Chungcheongnam-do province lost more than 70 km2 of tidal flats due to reclaimed land for farming. Coastal communities are now more vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise. Isahaya Bay, photo by Houjyou-Minori, CC BY 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons A common thread throughout these examples is the loss of wetlands. They are often threatened by reclamation as they lie next to seas, rivers and lakes, and have a shallow shore making construction easier. Their ecosystems sustain the earth’s life support systems. They are carbon sinks with areas like peatlands storing 30% of all land-based carbon. As the climate has worsened they are becoming even more important for carbon storage. Nearly 40% of all species rely on wetlands making them crucial for global biodiversity. Yet 35% of the world’s wetlands were lost between 1970 and 2015. What we’re losing is more valuable than what we’re gaining. This has coincided with extraordinary economic growth as world GDP increased from $24 trillion to $108 trillion in 45 years. The tales of this growth are concrete paving over floodplains, swamps drained of their water and coastal marshes dredged to oblivion. Destruction of wetlands on the Arthur Kill Waterway in New Jersey, National Archives at College Park, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Humanity also depends on wetlands for food. Rice is a staple of diets worldwide and grown in wetland areas. Before oil exploration inhabitants of the Niger Delta made a living as farmers, fishermen and hunters. The Delta supports the growing of rice, fruits and vegetables. Wetlands also protect us from storms and floods through rain absorption and buffering of the sea. Mangroves and salt marshes help shield 60% of the world’s population living along the world’s coastlines. Land reclamation leads to sea-level rise that can be much higher than background levels of local and global rises. This land will likely be impacted first when the climate worsens. As the world races to consume more we are cannibalising the very systems that give us life. In 1996 a photographer, Michael E. Stanley, visited Isahaya Bay before reclamation. He described an area teeming with life as frogs, crabs and other fauna zipped around this precious wetland. He returned a year later after the area was drained. This is what he described: The gata (tidal mud) had dried out and cracked deeply. The remains of small animals were scattered across what had been a galaxy of life. Nothing moved; the clicking, gurgling sounds of the crabs and the cries of gulls and terns were replaced by an occasional rustle of wind, nothing more. The government’s commitment to endless growth forced this project through despite it being unnecessary. The project was initially conceived as a way to increase rice production. When that proved false the argument switched to being about satisfying beef consumption. The uptick on a graph was more important than safeguarding nature. With unrestricted growth and land reclamation, the trauma of Isahaya Bay is being repeated around the world. Pollution is increasing and biodiversity is declining, putting our world at greater risk of catastrophe. The term “land reclamation” implies we are taking back what is rightfully ours and another example of how the words we use reflect ecocidal mindsets. We cannot claim the entire earth in order to satisfy neverending consumption. The natural world needs greater protection so it can sustain and protect us. From the gluttony of Palm Jumeirah to the fossil fuel-enabling ports of Rotterdam and Singapore, the world’s cash generating machine is creating existential risks. We must reclaim our planet from the clutches of money. We must reclaim nature for the millions of species that support life on earth. We must reclaim our communities from globalised power. We must reclaim democratic control through citizens’ assemblies.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/12/06/hot-take-5-soil-gets-a-break/,"Image courtesy of Dylan de Jonge on Unsplash The climate and ecological emergency (CEE) is a massive and daunting challenge. So in moments when positive news arrives, the healthy thing to do is pounce on it. The Sustainable Market Initiative’s new report, ‘Scaling Regenerative Farming: An Action Plan’, is one such moment, because it represents a significant absorption of radical environmental solutions by mainstream players. The question is, can we trust the mainstream players this time? Agriculture is the world’s largest industry, occupying approximately half of Earth’s habitable land and providing more than one billion people with a livelihood. However, contemporary industrial methods are placing agriculture and food supplies at risk by attacking ecosystems and degenerating land via chemicals, monocultures, and soil disruption. In addition, factors such as land-clearing, gasoline-powered machinery, and livestock methane emissions all contribute to climate change, which is in turn reducing global farming productivity. Regenerative farming can remedy this by working with nature while growing plants, so that farming becomes sustainable. Methods for regenerative farming vary because every ecosystem is different, but common themes include keeping soil covered between harvests and eliminating synthetic, chemical fertilizers and herbicides. The Sustainable Market Initiative (SMI) was launched by the then-Prince of Wales, at the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, in a bid to ‘enable the private sector to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future’. Its members are all chiefs of their respective companies and include Larry Fink (Blackrock), Bernard Looney (BP), Punit Renjen (Deloitte), Grant Reid (Mars), Ramon Laguarta (Pepsico), and Stella McCartney; it doesn’t get more mainstream than that, but please try to withhold your skepticism for just a few more paragraphs. Image courtesy of Abenteuer Albanien on Unsplash The SMI is divided into task forces and this new report is a product of the Agribusiness Task Force. That’s Mars, Bayer, HowGood, Indigo Agriculture, McCain Foods, McDonald’s, Mondelez, Olam, PepsiCo, the Sustainable Food Trust, Waitrose & Partners, and Yara International. In our March 2021 article, What is Regenerative Agriculture and Can it Feed the World?, we noted with hope how the North American food giant General Mills was researching the scalability of regenerative agriculture. Extinction Rebellion would be among the first in line to criticize the diabolical environmental records of companies like McDonald’s or PepsiCo, but there’s no denying their scale; to see such massive corporations getting behind regenerative agriculture is monumental. The SMI is not simply acknowledging regenerative agriculture, however. In this report, it’s trying to understand why regenerative agriculture is not spreading as rapidly as the CEE demands and do something about it. Citing a global regenerative farming conversion target of 40% by 2030, the report summarises the findings of three 14-week studies. These were conducted at a commercial contract UK potato farm, a smallhold basmati rice farm in India, and a mid-sized, family-run wheat farm in the USA. What’s striking about these directly quoted findings from ‘Scaling Regenerative Farming’ is that they might sound quite familiar to you: “We must shift our mindset” “Make decisions based on the balance of evidence, not precise costs and valuations” “Get better at collaboration” “Develop new models, not only sustainability teams” “Be guided by local specificity and cultural awareness” In its own formal and comfortably worded way, the SMI has echoed what you’ll hear if you spend a couple of hours at a climate justice protest... we can’t help wondering if the SMI has realized that yet. Image courtesy of the XR Global Media Library This report is impressively detailed and ultimately practical in nature. The Sustainable Market Initiative sounds like an expensive greenwashing factory (it counts Shell and BP among its members), but it’s clear that the SMI task force behind this particular report is desperate to turbocharge farming reform. Why? Because unlike some polluting industries, such as plastics or fossil fuels, agriculture will eat itself if it does not become sustainable. If farming continues on its current trajectories, difficulties in growing food will spread. In other words, the industry's fundamental reason for existing is threatened. The recent call for a mass shift to precision fermentation would theoretically render the contemporary agricultural system obsolete, while vertical farming points to diversification, but the biggest threat to the world's largest industry is its own degenerative practices. Image courtesy of Giulia Ferla via XR Global Media Library Imagine if a task force of huge energy companies assembled to figure out why renewables aren’t replacing fossil fuels as rapidly as the CEE demands, then took logical, practical action? This is extremely unlikely to happen, because huge energy companies have massive, temptingly profitable reserves of fossil fuels at their fingertips; agriculture does not have that luxury. Whatever their motivations may be, we should be cautiously optimistic that many of those who control our food supplies are taking the future seriously.

Outside, she paused to look over the horizon. Her home, like all the homes in Bahía del Paraíso, sat high in the air; protected from the floods that were a regular part of life in their small coastal community. From her perch, she could easily see all the way to the bay. In the early morning sunlight, the mangroves along the water’s edge glowed as if they were on fire. Beyond them, the crystal-clear blue water sparkled. Illustration for XR Wordsmiths by Rita Fei There had been a storm the night before. Not a very big one. The kind that Pipo dismissed as nothing more than a pequeño mosquito before going back to playing dominos with Uncle Eduardo. But even minor storms could leave behind unexpected treasures, so it was definitely worth checking out. She skipped along the boardwalk that connected all the houses in the village. Gabby’s Tía Maria, the community’s designer, had adamantly opposed the flying walkways. She argued that “flimsy bridges” would completely compromise the integrity of her carefully planned resilient design. Everyone understood the importance of strong homes, but these were practical people. They argued that it made no sense to climb down forty-five steps and then right back up just to visit the next-door neighbor. ""What about the old people?"" they had cried. ""Or the mothers with little children?"" Tía Maria finally gave in, but only after they had come up with a design that made it possible to detach the bridges whenever a hurricane approached. Gabby loved the bridges. Scampering from house to house made her feel like a creature living high in the trees of an exotic jungle. Gabby had recently turned thirteen. Like so many girls her age, she had experienced a growth spurt that left her tall and gangly. She navigated the swinging walkways with the loose grace of a child on the brink of becoming a confident young woman for whom every day would be a new adventure. Her partner in those adventures was Danh. Even though they were the same age, she was nearly a head taller than him. Where she was lean and willowy, he was solid and compact. But he was the only boy her age who could keep up with her. They never missed the chance to search for treasures after a storm. Standing on the deck that surrounded Danh’s house, she peered inside his open bedroom window and called out quietly, “Danh, you awake?” “’Bout time, em gái,” his booming response came from behind. Startled, she spun around to see Danh, floating on his hoverboard, just above her head. “Jerk,” she said, and swatted playfully at him. He deftly maneuvered the board out of reach and smiled. “Race you down,” he challenged and then disappeared as he sent the board into a steep dive. Gabby ran for the stairs. She hit every third step on the way down, getting to the bottom as fast as she could, where a smirking Danh leaned casually against the rail. “You cheat,” she complained. “You just hate that you’re too klutzy to fly a board.” “I can still beat you in a fair race,” Gabby shouted suddenly. She dashed off toward the water. Danh watched her go and then hopped on his board. It didn’t take him long to catch up. He slowed to match her pace, and the two of them followed the paths that zigzagged through the parklike greenspace that separated the homes from the bay. When they finally reached the beach, Gabby dropped to the sand, out of breath. Danh circled her twice before stepping off the board. The board idled by his side, ready to follow wherever he went. After a few deep gulps of air, Gabby sat up and surveyed the beach. “I already did a zoom-by. Nothing interesting,” Danh offered. “Bummer,” Gabby replied. That was life as a storm pirate. Most of the time you only found little odds and ends, usually from the homes destroyed when the old barrier islands disappeared. Sometimes you got lucky and scored major treasure. Earlier in the summer, after a particularly big storm, they had discovered an ancient-looking log floating just offshore. Gabby’s mother told them it looked like part of a Bodhi tree that might have been carried by the storm all the way from the Ivory Coast of Africa. They had debated long and hard before deciding what to do with their newfound treasure. It was a point of pride among the community to reuse everything, even trash blown in by the storms. The village Remakers repurposed the found objects into works of art, benches, and even playground structures that dotted the village. Danh had imagined the log would make an impressive totem pole, but Gabby argued for something useful. In the end, they had compromised. With the help of Danh’s dad, the best carver in the village, they turned the log into a bench with an intricately detailed scene telling the story of the Bodhi tree. Even though they didn’t expect to find anything nearly as exciting today, they still walked the beach. The tide was going out, so they wandered among the mangroves—primordial trees with twisted roots dipping in and out of the water. Gabby and Danh meandered along until they came to the village’s picnic pavilion. Their bench was just beyond, tucked away in a stand of tall bamboo. They sat down on the bench, close enough that their knees touched. The feeling sent a tiny tingle up Gabby’s spine. “So, whadya doing today?” she asked. Danh, apparently completely unaware of the physical tension in the air, replied nonchalantly, “Working on one of your aunt’s bio-digester stations.” Gabby laughed. “I warned you about asking Tía Maria to be your mentor. Once she gets hold of you, there’s no getting away.” Danh pulled a handful of leaves off the bamboo growing next to the bench. He began weaving them together as they talked. “No poop shall go unscooped.” “Eh, gross,” Gabby hit Danh’s knee with hers. “Now you’re just trying to be disgusting.” Danh finished twisting the leaves together and held up an intricately woven bamboo ring. He handed it to Gabby and said, “All part of the great circle of life, em gái.” She took it from him and just stared at it. What was this supposed to mean? Was Danh giving her a ring? Or was it just another one of his goofy jokes? “So, what you up to today?” Danh asked. “Aqua harvest with Mom.” Gabby’s mother managed the community’s aquafarm. It was was one of the village’s most successful projects, providing food for the residents and a source of income. The water in the bay was cleaner than it had been in over a hundred years. With a little help from local marine biologists, it had been easy to re-establish the oyster and scallop beds and bring back the fish and shrimp populations. The return of the seafood harvests was a reminder of what had brought many of Gabby’s and Danh’s ancestors to this coast originally. Today, that natural bounty was enhanced by the latest sustainable aquaculture methods, and the village was once again a prime supplier of fresh seafood to the surrounding communities. Working with her Mom, Gabby could earn badges in marine biology and aqua-ag. She thought she might even do a little marine science one day. For now, she mainly liked hanging out with her mother. Seafood was just one of the community’s agricultural bounties. There were box gardens that lined the community pathways where anyone could pick a handful of herbs to cook, small plots near every house, and even a state-of-the-art aeroponics greenhouse. Inside the greenhouse, vegetables literally grew in the air, their bare roots hanging down like stringy hair. Between the year-round warm weather and cutting-edge agriculture technology, the community produced more than enough food to feed itself and to send to nearby markets. “Oh, hey. S’posed to ask if you want to come to Pipo’s birthday party on Friday. He’s turning ninety-five, so Mom and Tía Maria are going all out.” “For sure,” Danh exclaimed. “I mean, if it’s cool with you and all.” Gabby tried to respond nonchalantly. “Whatever, it’s nice to have somebody my age around, you know. They may even make ropa vieja. It’s Pipo’s favorite and Mom said she knew you liked it.” “With real beef? Last time your mom made that, I pigged out. Kinda surprised she’d invite me back.” “Oh, she thinks you’re special.” Gabby smiled. In fact, Sophia and Tía Maria had taken to referring to Danh as Gabby’s “special friend.” Gabby wasn’t sure how she felt about that. Oh, she knew their relationship was way different, but that didn’t mean she wanted her mother to be broadcasting it to everyone. They spent the next few minutes sitting in silence, something they often did. At first these pauses had felt awkward, but lately Gabby had realized that they were special moments—sharing the natural beauty of this place they were so lucky to call home. Pipo, out for his morning walk, interrupted their reverie. He rarely missed a day and always wore the same outfit—a perfectly pressed guayabera shirt, linen slacks, and his trademark Panama hat. He stopped when he saw them. “Why are you niños not in school?” he demanded. Gabby blushed and tried to explain to him, for the hundredth time, that it was not like the old days when sitting in a classroom was the only place you could learn. When she had finally finished her explanation, Pipo shook his head in bewilderment. “Come walk with me, nieta.” Gabby gave Danh a quick look and got up. “So, see you Friday, here in the park.” “It’s a date,” he replied, hopping off the bench. When he realized what he had said, he stammered quickly, “Gotta fly. Got poop to scoop.” With that, he jumped on the hoverboard and zipped off. She watched him disappear. A voice in her head was shrieking: A date? Is that really what he had said? She wasn’t sure if she was scared, excited, or both. She was so distracted that she didn’t even notice that Pipo had continued his walk without her. She ran to catch up and took his hand as they walked toward the shore. Pipo began to reminisce. Walking with one of his grandchildren and telling them stories of the past was his favorite thing to do. Gabby was frequently his audience, and she had heard most of his stories many times. “You know, Gabriela, we used to live right here on this very spot. Our home wasn’t fancy, but it had been in our family for seven generations, ever since our people first came here to fish. Then came the summer of the great storms. Six hurricanes in less than three months. It seemed like we spent all our time getting ready for a storm or cleaning up after one; sometimes doing both at the same time. The last storm, the biggest one of all, hit right here. The entire village washed away. Destruido. Your abuela cried and cried for days.” The thought of Gabby’s grandmother losing everything made her so sad every time she heard this story, even though she knew it had a happy ending. Over the years, life after the storms had developed into a predictable pattern. First came the clean-up, sometimes taking weeks or months, then the insurance companies and the government would help them rebuild. But this time the insurance companies didn’t come. They said there had been too many storms and they were out of money. The state’s catastrophe fund was empty, and there were no funds available from the federal government. For the first time, the residents didn’t know how they were going to rebuild. That’s when Tía Maria came home. She had been working up north as an urban planner. Under her leadership, a group of homeowners approached the city with a bold plan. In exchange for assistance in building new homes, the citizens would turn over their land along the shore. Everyone agreed that the old ways weren’t going to work anymore, especially as the sea levels continued to rise and the warmer ocean waters spawned more violent storms. After months of negotiations, the officials learned what Gabby’s family had long known; you don’t argue with Tía Maria. And that was how Bahía del Paraíso was born. In exchange for the coastline property, the city gave the residents vacant farmland next to the former village. The land—long ago over-farmed and abandoned—was considered worthless. But when Tía Maria got her hands on it, she got to work building a world class resilient village. In just five years, the community reached their goal of having a zero-carbon footprint. In fact, they had a net positive effect on the environment. Those improvements meant that the residents were healthier and happier. Important people from around the world came to visit them now. The United Nations had even designated Bahía del Paraíso a sustainable world site, and Tía Maria was always being invited to important conferences to tell their story. Pipo stopped walking. Gabby knew they had reached his favorite spot on the beach. Thirty yards offshore, an enormous, brightly colored sea dragon rose out of the water. The dragon’s scales were made from ceramic tiles, salvaged from Pipo’s old home. Tiles that Gabby’s ancestors brought all the way from Cuba. Gabby thought it was pretty neat that something from her family’s past was now part of her future. What was even cooler to a thirteen-year-old was that the Remakers had rigged the dragon to use bio-gas to breathe real fire. Of course, Tía Maria only allowed them to light it on special occasions. Pipo’s birthday would be one of those special occasions. Gabby imagined the scene. The dragon that represented her family, breathing fire under a star-filled sky, moonlight reflecting off the water. It just might be the perfect time and place for a first kiss. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/11/09/global-newsletter-70/,"A Finnish rebel blockades a pulp mill that will turn forest trees into packaging. This issue: Finland Rebels | NYC Rebels | Australia Rebels | Just Stop Oil UK | Dear rebel, COP27 has begun, but expectations are at rock bottom. On top of the usual charge sheet (Global North intransigence, oil lobbyist interloping, serial broken promises) comes the fact that this year’s UN climate summit will be effectively greenwashing a police state. Egypt’s military government has killed, imprisoned and tortured thousands of peaceful activists since its rise to power in 2013. Protest is de facto illegal in the country. COP27 will be held in a region reserved for tourists and a tiny elite, which the Egyptian public cannot access, and where foreign activists must book slots to protest in a car park. If COP27 manages to achieve anything of note we will cover it in our next issue, but for now we have much more promising things to focus on, like global rebellion. One rebel koala is plucked from his tripod outside a state-owned logging company in Melbourne, Australia. In Action Highlights we report on how Finnish rebels targeted the logging companies turning their forests into packaging, how New York rebels targeted the CEOs of the biggest fossil fuel financiers in the world, and how Australian rebels targeted loggers, financiers and more in not one but two major rebellions across the island’s south coast. We also dedicate this month’s Solidarity Corner to Just Stop Oil, who have just completed four weeks of daily disruption in London. The group’s provocative tactics, including throwing soup at (glass-protected) artworks, have drawn a lot of criticism, even from supporters of XR. But the evidence shows that negative coverage of peaceful protesters doesn’t harm the underlying cause. Instead, it creates space for debate of the wider issues and increases support for the more moderate flanks of the same cause. A Just Stop Oil activist is arrested in London, one of 718 arrests in the last month. We live in a surreal world where a painting being apparently damaged causes more outrage than hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives and livelihoods to floods and drought in Pakistan and Somalia. The Global North, through its historic and continuing use of fossil fuels, has directly caused that intense and ongoing suffering. It should weigh on all of us, and instead of condemning the protesters harmlessly highlighting it, we should aim our ire at the politicians in Egypt who are grossly perpetuating the injustice.

After a night of poetry, music and dance in a Helsinki park, the rebels got to work. 300 of them blocked a major highway beside their parliament, 46 were arrested by police throughout the day, and the action made it onto the evening news. The ‘Rebellion for Nature’ was off to a rowdy start. Ecological decline and the climate crisis go hand in hand, and Elokapina (XR Finland) focused their autumn rebellion on protecting Finland’s forests, empowering the indigenous Saami people whose culture depends on them, and ending factory farming, which the government still subsidises. Lastly, they demanded Finland pay its climate debts to the Global South. 30 rebels rallied outside a pulp mill in Lapland, still being constructed by Metsä Group, a logging corporation that turns old-growth trees into disposable packaging. Once complete, it will be the largest pulp mill in the Northern Hemisphere. Police were present but did not intervene. After blocking traffic to the site all day, the rebels were allowed to walk home. Rebels blockaded highways, marched through supermarkets, occupied logging companies, and took over a bridge to highlight Finland’s fragile ecology. The next day, Elokapina launched simultaneous blockades of Metsä Group’s, and two other major logging company’s headquarters. Rebels swarmed into the entrances and lobbies, gluing themselves to walls and silently holding signs with their demands. The demonstration at Metsä Group lasted more than 6 hours. Funeral marches were held in outlets of two major supermarkets for fuelling animal-based food production, and Red Rebels joined a slow march down the stairs of the Finnish parliament building to highlight the many native animal species in danger of extinction. The rebellion closed as it had begun, with hundreds of rebels blockading the road in front of the Finnish parliament. With silence from the government, the blockade moved to a major bridge, where rebels chanted in solidarity as police arrested dozens of their comrades locked together in a symbolic circle. More than 700 rebels participated in the rebellion, with a quarter of those newly trained-up recruits. There were fewer arrests this time, thanks to a tactical shift away from blockades to more diverse actions, but the campaign still attracted extensive media attention. And this time there were no run-ins with neo-Nazis. Follow Elokapina on Facebook and Twitter. 24 - 29 OCT | New York, USA Protesters dump coal across BlackRock’s lobby floor. Photo: Adrian Childress XR NYC joined with a coalition of climate activist groups for six days of action across the city. 49 protesters were arrested during the campaign, which was coordinated by New York Communities for Change and involved multiple blockades of Park Avenue, home to some of the most ecocidal corporations on the planet. As well as launching actions involving more than 600 people, the coalition scored an early publicity hit by interrupting a live TV interview with a climate-denying senator. ABC, the channel broadcasting the interview, covered the climate crisis for a measly five and a half hours over the entirety of 2021. A rebel outside the world’s dirtiest bank, JPMorgan Chase. Photo: Katie Godowsky The rebel alliance first shut down Park Avenue outside BlackRock’s headquarters, the world’s largest asset manager, and another vast and unrepentant investor in fossil fuels. 15 activists were arrested for blocking traffic. Another 10 were arrested the next day for occupying BlackRock’s lobby and dumping coal across its floor. Activists used two tripods to shut down Park Avenue again outside investment bank JPMorgan Chase, the biggest funder of fossil fuels on the planet. Its CEO has persisted in promoting fossil fuel investment and extraction, while shareholder efforts to push the bank away from financing ecocide have failed. They came for CEO brains, but made do with tomato soup. Photo: Adrian Childress Finally, the CEO’s of KKR and Blackstone woke up to find ‘zombie’ activists eating outside their elite apartment block. The private equity groups both own multiple fossil fuel companies and are answerable only to their elite investors. Over half of Blackstone’s investments are in fossil fuels, while for KKR it’s over three quarters. Dumb and dumber. The week of actions was timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Superstorm Sandy, which devastated parts of Manhattan and the New Jersey coast. The risk of more catastrophic damage rises with every year that the current system continues.

Photo: Matt Hrkac Throughout October, rebels in Victoria and South Australia have marched, blockaded, and even set sail to demand an end to fossil fuel investments, an end to the destruction of native forests, and an end to government climate inaction. The action began with a trip to Corio Bay, on the unceded territory of the Wadawurrung/Wathaurong people of the Kulin Nations, where rebels took to the waves on kayaks and boats (including a beautiful pink one) to block an oil tanker. The pink boat returns (hooray!) for the Corio Bay action. Right: a rally in central Melbourne against the financiers of the climate crisis. Photo: Danielle Judd. Days later, rebels in Victoria reforested the road outside a rapacious state-owned logging company, disrupted the AGM of a major fossil fuel funding bank, and, in collaboration with other climate justice groups, swarmed the streets of Melbourne. There, two rebels made international headlines by gluing themselves to a Picasso painting. Meanwhile, hundreds of rebels took action at the Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference, an event held in Adelaide despite the fact that the South Australian Government has declared a climate emergency. Undeterred by a heavy police presence, rebels blocked the site entrance and disrupted the summit for its three-day run. Police block access to the Asia Pacific Oil & Gas conference. Right: The magnificent ‘Oilies’ join the Adelaide protest. Photos: Peter Barnes & Ella Ma. The day after the conference, rebels attended the State Government’s Roundtable on Oil and Gas. They interrupted the Minister for Energy and Mining’s address by locking and glueing themselves to doors inside the venue. Once the room was finally cleared of protesters, the Minister spoke off the cuff to the oil and gas industry, saying “make no mistake, (the protesters) are having an impact”. And yet the impact has not been enough to trigger Australia’s divorce from fossil fuels - meaning new rebel actions are already in the making.

Police reacted violently to the peaceful protest. One rebel was hospitalised after being beaten. Thankfully, he made a full recovery. Sign: Protect The Common Home (The Earth) 8 OCT | Ostrava, Czech Republic: ​​End Coal Now activists occupy Svoboda coal plant. The action was launched after a week-long climate camp in the region. 8 - 9 OCT | Feluy & Liege, Belgium: Rebels joined more than 1000 activists to blockade two oil refineries belonging to Total Energies. The action, organised by Code Rood, was one of Belgium’s largest ever acts of civil disobedience and lasted two days. 10 OCT | Cressier, Switzerland: Activists from Debt For Climate (including rebels) shut down Switzerland’s only oil refinery to highlight the country’s colonial legacy and demand solidarity with the Global South. The blockade used the world’s first ‘Hanging Beacon’ - an elaborate contraption jointly designed by a rebel and a D4C activist. 14 - 25 OCT | Worldwide: Last month saw D4C and Scientist Rebellion campaigns that were global in scope. D4C highlights include solidarity actions in South Africa and Argentina (top). Scientist Rebellion held marches in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and outside the German Embassy in Kinshasa, DRC (below). 21 OCT | Buenos Aires, Argentina: Rebels disrupt the C40 Summit, which brings together more than 100 mayors from around the world to discuss (then do nothing about) the climate crisis. 20/29 OCT | Wolfsburg/Munich: Nine Scientist Rebellion activists glue themselves to the Porsche pavilion of the Volkswagen car museum, calling for a 100 km/h speed limit and other measures to drastically reduce German transport emissions. The action became a two-day occupation. A week later, 16 scientists were arrested for glueing themselves to a BMW dealership and blocking an intersection in Munich. All 16 were imprisoned, some for up to 7 days, while awaiting trial. OCTOBER | Europe: Last month saw peaceful climate protesters imprisoned across Europe. 16 rebel scientists in Munich faced up to a week in prison, while 13 members of Last Generation are still in preventative detention in the city, and could stay there for up to a month. 6 Just Stop Oil protesters are imprisoned in the UK either awaiting trial or serving sentences, and 3 more supporters were sentenced to 2 months in jail in Holland. Finally, 2 Swedish rebels who occupied an airport runway last October have been sentenced to 2 months in jail - the first time peaceful activists have ever been imprisoned in Sweden. Both are parents to young children. So much happened this month, we can’t fit it all into one newsletter. Head over to NEWSLETTER XTRA to find out about actions in Nigeria, Panama, India & more. NEWSLETTER XTRA: A feast for the eyes and extra fuel for the soul! Read Newsletter XTRA Van Gogh’s Sunflowers was not harmed, but the outcry was worldwide. Last month Just Stop Oil declared Westminster, home of the UK government, a site of nonviolent civil resistance. They promised to return day after day until their demand - that the government stop all new oil and gas projects - was met. What followed was an extraordinary 32 days of continuous action across the capital. The bold tactics of a committed band of people garnered global attention, triggered fierce debate, and resulted in 718 arrests. While it was the small but provocative actions that grabbed the headlines - the soup thrown at Van Gogh’s Sunflowers, the scaling of bridge masts 84m high - it was road blockades that formed the bulk of the campaign. The conviction and resilience needed to take part in these blockades should not be underestimated. Road blockades are stressful but empowering and require a lot of careful planning. The resistance campaign started with Just Stop Oil joining climate, socialist, workers, anti-war, and anti-racist groups to march into Westminster. Thousands demanded an end to the climate crisis and the related cost of living crisis, with UK households suffering sky-high energy bills because of government incompetence. But the huge turnout wasn’t replicated for the road blockades that followed. With the resultant disruption failing to induce policy change or media scrutiny, Just Stop Oil had to get inventive. Small, provocative actions targeting artworks were launched. No artworks were damaged, but the actions were criticised by many, even those within the climate movement. The fear was that the public would not just recoil from the tactics, but the cause itself. Various institutions culpable for the climate crisis were sprayed with orange paint, inc. media giant News Corp, the Bank of England, the Home Office & MI5. Thankfully, the evidence shows that is not the case. Negative media attention on protesters doesn’t harm the underlying cause, does create space for debate of the wider issues, and increases support for the more moderate flanks of the same cause. Just Stop Oil has seen a big upturn in new recruits since the Van Gogh action, and that’s despite repressive new laws that mean prison time and higher fines are more likely for peaceful but disruptive protest. Six Just Stop Oil activists are currently in prison awaiting trial or serving sentences (read the statements of two of them). With the UK government still planning to extract oil and gas from the North Sea, Just Stop Oil’s civil resistance will continue. Motorway blockades are planned across the country. As one activist puts it, “We can’t be obedient to a system that is killing us”. We at this newsletter salute the activists of Just Stop Oil for their bravery, empathy, and resilience, and give them our unwavering solidarity.

A woman describes her intense connection to her home, a desert valley whose saguaro cactuses are gradually dying—and not being replaced by young seedlings—because of chronic drought. Another begins by describing the invasion of lionfish in Dominican waters, segues into Superstorm Sandy, gender identity, and family dynamics, and ends up on a sand dune in Senegal with her partner under the stars. “Because without these dreams, I do not know how to live”. Another discusses sexism and identity in Antarctica. And on and on. Not all the authors are women, but many of them are. Some of the stories discuss climate directly, but many of them don’t. One striking aspect of this book is how many of the authors are not Anglo-Americans or white Europeans—to a large extent, this book is a record of perspectives that tend to get drowned out. It’s a book best read gradually, perhaps one essay or two at a time, with plenty of time to think about and sit with each one. It’s a book largely without answers. It’s a book to read to remember that you’re not alone. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops by buying books at Bookshop or Hive.

Or just another opportunity for “greenwashing, lying and cheating” in a series of conferences that have ""monumentally failed humanity and all the living world for 26 years""? Image courtesy of the XR Global Media Library The 27th UN Conference of the Parties in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt - COP27 - arrives in the context of rising inflation worldwide, war in Ukraine and beyond, and potential global recession - and, as with every COP in the context of an accelerating climate and ecological emergency (CEE), it matters more than ever before. In the smouldering ashes of an unsurprisingly disappointing COP26 in Glasgow, the recent United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) “Emissions Gap” report highlights how last year’s updated national pledges (NDCs) have had a “negligible difference” on predicted global emissions levels by 2030, leaving us on a path to a catastrophic 2.4°C of warming by 2100 as the effects of the climate crisis are already being felt worldwide. So, is there any hope for COP27? What needs to be achieved for it to be a success? And, where else can we draw strength from, in light of failing multilateral governance? Image by Andrea Domeniconi, courtesy of the XR Global Media Library COP27 got off to an awful start, announcing Coca-Cola - a company ranked the world’s “Top Plastic Polluter” for four consecutive years (2018-2021) - as its primary sponsor. There is little doubt that this partnership “undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor”, but beyond Coca-Cola, plastic pollution has deep corporate and colonial roots. Perhaps more outrageous than the deep harm plastic does to our oceans is the disproportionate impact its production and consumption has on marginalised communities across the world. The cherry on the cake? Coca-Cola has sent PR firm Hill & Knowlton to do their publicity at the conference - a PR firm whose previous clients include big tobacco and big oil…simultaneously. The fact the UN managed to get itself into bed with a petrochemical polluter should be surprising - an outrage, really - yet given that COP26 was sponsored by Unilever, a current and previous ‘Top Plastic Polluter’ itself, this level of wilful ignorance and cognitive dissonance is, sadly, unsurprising. In light of the spike of disinformation and corporate greenwashing that tends to accompany COP, “Climate Action Against Disinformation” - a “coalition of over 50 leading climate and anti-disinformation organisations”, has released a COP27 Survival Kit on how you can look out for and take action on climate disinformation over the next ten days. “Loss and damages” is the phrase of the moment at COP27, yet only just made it onto the official agenda. It refers to the ‘losses’ and ‘damages’ countries are and will continue to experience due to the CEE. As the Costa Rican NGO Ruta del Clima notes, these losses and damages need to be seen through more than a simple economic lens, but as socio-cultural too, including impacts on language and traditions, as well as forced displacement for frontline communities. Image by Mark Richards, courtesy of the XR Global Media Library This phenomenon is underpinned by two truths: In the context of UN climate negotiations, countries already suffering these impacts have been pressing for wealthier nations - whose colonial and neocolonial activities have exacerbated global inequalities and vulnerabilities to the CEE - to provide financial compensation through legal recognition of responsibility for these losses and damages, in light of moral and historic obligations. Recent flooding in Nigeria and (yet another) drought in Somalia are just two of myriad examples of this trend. However, multilateral negotiations have a long history of failing to meet agreements on climate finance. A promise made at COP15 in 2009 of $100 billion to assist ‘developing’ countries adapt to climate change has not materialised. And, while COP19 in Warsaw established the ""International Mechanism for Loss and Damages"", this was directly undermined by Paragraph 51 in Article 8 of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement (COP21) which states explicitly that the agreement heralded by some as the “world’s greatest diplomatic success” does “not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation”. Recent positive steps taken by Denmark show there is still hope here. Ultimately and sadly, for many small island nations and those already suffering from the CEE, COPs are a primary, if not the only platform for speaking out with any hope of meaningful recognition from governments and finance institutions in the Global North. In the words of the inimitable Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, speaking at COP26: “Failure to provide the critical finance, and that of loss and damage, is measured, my friends, in lives and livelihoods in our communities. It is immoral, and unjust”. Whether or not COP27 will deliver on these urgent justice-centred needs remains to be seen. A consistent positive outcome from COPs since 2009 has been the transnational mobilisation of civil society groups in and around the conferences. At COP27, the on-the-ground ability for activists to mobilise and protest freely is severely hampered both by concerns over human rights abuses perpetrated by the Egyptian government, and draconian guidelines necessitating 36 hours advance notice for authorities, accreditation and a 10:00-17:00 window in a surveilled area far from the conference zone for any protest activities. In an even more overtly dystopian turn, recent reports indicate that Wi-Fi in the conference zones is blocking access to various news agencies and human rights websites, with founder of youth climate justice movement Earth Uprising, Alexandria Villaseñor, pointing out that: “there is no climate action without truth or information”. Those with experience on the ground at COPs will know that restrictions on freedom of expression and protest are not a new phenomenon at global climate conferences: heavy-handed and intimidating policing tactics were used in Glasgow to quash protest; while vaccine apartheid kept many civil society leaders from the Global South away while hundreds of fossil fuel lobbyists flooded in. Image by Sara Martin, courtesy of the XR Global Media Library In previous years, the gathering of activist-citizens from across the world has led to the creation of large-scale coalition movements, including the Climate Justice Coalition - a network of over 100 social movements, campaign groups and NGOs - which successfully mobilised over 100,000 people onto the streets of Glasgow in November last year, and many more around the world. The Coalition has organised another day of global action, to be held on November 12, 2022. Also exciting has been the development of ‘Alternative COPs’, like the ‘Cumbre Social’ (Social Climate Summit) in and around COP25 in Madrid, which gave a platform to groups and speakers excluded from the official negotiating spaces, such as Indigenous leaders or more critical activist voices. This year, the COP27 Coalition is led by Egyptian, African and Arab civil society groups and they have five key demands: Given the restrictions that are in place, the realisation of these demands is uncertain, though the forming of the coalition itself is an undoubted force for good. Despite this, perhaps the most important question we can ask ourselves is: would this energy be better spent elsewhere? At the heart of the myriad contradictions present at COP27 is the key question: Is COP set up to fail? The repeated exclusion and alienation of individuals and communities on the frontline of the CEE suggests it is. The repeated failure of these conferences to re-frame the issue beyond the confines of a perverse ‘growth-centric’ and western-centric mindset suggests it is. The repeated failure of those countries most responsible for the extractivist, expansionist mindset to commit to action at the scale and pace required suggests it is. However, written in safety thousands of miles away from either the conference itself or those areas and peoples who have suffered both loss and damage due to the CEE already, these critiques are a luxury. The reality is that we need urgent action on every level. The reality is that those in the Global North have historic and moral duties to redress climate injustices increasingly measured in lives lost. The reality is that we have to act now, tell the truth, and go beyond the broken politics of the past to have any chance of reaching the just, equitable and sustainable futures this crisis demands. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

The following stories - 'The Old Man and the Bird' (original artwork by Dustin Jacobus) and 'Blood Oil' - (original artwork by João Queiroz) were written by two winners in the 12-18 category, Aël Magnard and Rebecca ""Reb"" Spring. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It had been years since the bird heard the last trucks, saws, and men cutting down the trees, killing its friends, and destroying its home. The colorful bird was singing on its tree, waiting for the Old Man to tell him stories. The Old Man told him about men’s cities: lush forests of blue, green, and gold, far away from the bird’s home. The stories were so different from the tales of the bird’s grandfather, who told him about dark, grey places of fear and misery. He was happy. The Old Man was here. The Old Man always talked to the bird, sometimes to the trees of the forest. He thought they did not understand him, for they did not share a language. He had always said, in the old times, ‘Birds scream at the top of their lungs in horrified hellish rage every morning at daybreak to warn us all of the truth, but sadly we don’t speak bird.’ Little did he know, the little bird, and the forest, understood the Old Man. They were good friends, but unable to share their experiences. One day, the bird decided to see the world for himself. It would be a long and tedious journey, but the bird was hopeful about it. He first went to see the Old Man to ask him for advice. ""I’m going out of the forest to see the world"" tweeted the bird. The Old Man answered, not understanding him: ""Hello little bird, ready to go out and explore the wide world on your own I see. You’ll see, it is beautiful, now that we, humans beings, have finally made peace with Mother Nature. No more plastics, toxic chemicals, pesticides, or grey fumes coming from fossil fuel powerplants. No more overexploitation, no more greed driving us to destroy Earth’s treasures. Now, green cities with the bluest skies. Families in gardens, adults reconciling with the nature they once feared. Kindness, compassion, and service are universally accepted and expected. I hope you’ll find some friends during your journey. Farewell, little bird."" Original artwork - Dustin Jacobus Little did they understand each other, but the bird could tell that the Old Man was happy to see him. And maybe a little sad at the same time. ""Don’t worry"" said the bird, ""I’ll be back soon."" The Old Man let a tear roll down his cheek. The bird flew across emeralds seas and sapphire skies, across mountain tops kissed with snow. He flew across deserts of golden sands and blue waters of tranquility. The bird learned that the world was a beautiful but fragile place, as the Earth showed him the scars man left on her. He flew through rains, storms, sandstorms, and even blizzards (the accelerated forces of natural selection had made him a very tough bird, almost a super bird) and learned that no matter how dark the sky could be at night, the day would eventually come. No matter how the sky was filled with black clouds of grey lighting, sandstorms, or freezing ice, the sun would shine again. Yes, the little bird learned that hope would exist as long as that beautiful yet fragile world would. He learned that preserving that beauty was the only way to preserve hope. And he was glad that the friends of the Old Man had helped preserve his forest. A few weeks later, the bird arrived at his first human settlement. (He explored the wilderness for some time, even though the city was only a few hours away). Strangely, he almost mistook the city for some alien forest, all green and blue. It wasn’t the cities his grandfather told him about. It was merrier, greener, quieter. There, the bird met a young puppy, with white fur. ""Hello, puppy” he said. The non-humans animals could understand each other, while humans animals had lost that ability since they walked away from harmony with Mother Nature. ""Hello, bird."" ""I’ve never seen a colorful bird like you before"" said the dog. ""Who are you?"" ""My friend, call me Birdie"", responded the Bird. ""You’re my friend right?"" ""I could use one"", said the dog. ""My name is Wouf."" ""Have you ever been outside the City” asked the bird. ""I haven’t, I am still a young puppy and I have been told that outside my comfort zone (the couch) is a dangerous place to be""’ ""Everybody says that Wouf; until they realize that it is not a very dangerous place to be but an exciting one"". ""If you say so. You come from a faraway place, after all, you must know what you’re talking about"" said the dog. ""Well. sometimes I do. Sometimes, I don’t. Would you like to explore the outskirts of the city with me?"" ""I’d love to, my flying friend"". Birdie and Wouf started their journey exploring the city’s wild outskirts. They went to the hills, through flowers and encountered a few unfamiliar species of insect (that Birdie ate). A few hours after the sun was set, they found a young couple on the sweet green grass. The pair talked about the stars and how they were beautiful. They talked about the Earth, about love, friendship, and all those marvellous things you can feel yet not see. They laughed a lot and finally fell asleep in each other’s arms. The dog, who understood man’s language offered to translate what the young human couple said to the bird. In the morning, the bird gently tweeted and the dog woofed softly as the sound of the hills woke the young duo. They saw the bird and the dog. ""He is so cute"" said the boy. He loved dogs. The girl rather liked the bird. Maybe they had something to teach them. ""Hello bird, hello dog"", said the girl. ""My name is Lia and here’s my boyfriend, Peter"". The dog translated for the little bird, but he already knew, of course, that the boy and the girl were together. Love was universal. ""I’m Wouf and this is my friend, Birdie"", replied the dog, pointing his muzzle toward the flying creature. The boy who liked dogs understood Wouf, and they all became friends and made friendship bracelets. Because that’s what friends do. The bird asked the humans if they wanted to explore the world with him. They told him they’d be glad to go with him. They packed their bags full of what they called ‘green equitable tech’ - solar-powered cameras, field recorders, and other devices that would enable them to record what they saw and heard on their journey. Soon enough, the little group went out in the wild, explored ancient and forgotten cities, and met new people, animals, and ideas. The young couple became married and adopted the dog (who was free to come and go out of the house as he pleased) and lived a happy life. Meanwhile, the bird learned to talk to the trees. A few years later, they saw each other at the Old Man’s funeral. They were sad and cried a lot, but were happy too, for his body was to become part of the Earth again. During the funeral, there were almost as many non-human animals as they were humans. For the first time in many years, the bird experienced sadness. Wouf grew older, faster than Birdie. The man, Peter (who was not young anymore, except in his head) learned the bird’s language, (he was terrible at it, but he tried) for he knew that when the dog eventually passed away, they would not be able to share their experiences. However, Wouf lived longer than anyone could hope. The bird eventually found happiness again. They all went on a trip to see the wonderful world once more. This time around, they were able to take a shuttle to see it from above. It was magical and at this moment, like all astronauts that came before them, they understood how this world was their responsibility and how beautiful and fragile it was. Like hope. They all thought that they must take care of it, for the dog while he was there, and all the dogs that would come after him. After Wouf’s death, the bird went back to the forest to talk to the trees and to die in peace. (He was very old when Wouf died). He knew that Peter’s children would take care of the forest, like their parents and the Old Man before them. Birdie was glad he had the chance to travel the world and tell his story to all the birds in the forest. And now that his story was over, it was time for someone else to take his place, so the story of hope would live in the hearts of all living inhabitants of Earth. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I walk through the tall grass, it whispers against my legs. My bare feet press against the soft soil and I hear Mother Earth calling out to me, crying for help. Along the horizon, I see the oil pipeline cutting across the forest, swaths of trees chopped down in its wake. A scar cutting across Mother Earth, drawing the blood from within her to the surface. Blood flowing forth, a torrent of blood. Crude oil. Blood oil. They keep cutting her. They don’t bother to put on a band-aid. They don’t care. They just want her blood. Fossil fuel vampires. Original illustration - João Queiroz My head throbs painfully. A blob of black liquid collects up the hill. It flows from the pipeline. It flows down the hill. Blood. Flowing right toward me. I blink. Then I run. The wind carries me forward, pushes me on, until I see a shaky outline, the worn shingles of my roof. The frame still slants from last summer’s hurricane, but it’s home. My mama must’ve seen me running for my life, because she throws open the wooden front door with the peeling green paint. I dash in and flop onto the flowered couch with the worn cushions. My heart beats rapidly in my chest, and I feel like I can faintly hear Mother Earth’s heart beating rapidly far below me. Thump thump. Thump thump. Thump thump. I hear Mama clomping down the stairs and look up from my bowl of cereal. When she rounds the landing,I see her dressed in a crisp, forest green, dress suit. A patch on her suit reads “Green New Deal.” “Mama! Your suit looks beautiful! Where did you get it?” “From my new job.” “Oooh, what is it?” “We finally got funds from the government to build renewable energy in our community and clean up the mess from the old oil pipeline. And I was selected as one of the coordinators for our community!” Her smile spreads wide and her eyes sparkle for the first time in what feels like forever. Papa and I walk towards the creek, the slender fishing poles slung across our backs shining in the sunlight. Papa’s muscular, tired frame is outlined by the brutal rays of sun. The worms thrash about in the can I carry. I can feel their little bodies press up against the metal sides of the can, trying to break free. I see the creek shimmering in the sunlight, and I dash towards it. “C’mon, Papa!” I smile back at him. But when I reach the creek, my body goes stiff with shock. It isn’t the water in the creek that was shimmering in the sunlight. It is the oil. The thick black ooze flows with the creek, rivulets of darkness, as far as the eye can see. Its oily black tendrils spread over the width of the creek, curling around the roots of trees. A fish leaps out of the water, its once pink-and-white body now covered in black. My heart squeezes. My heart feels pain for the Earth, like my heart has oil being squeezed out of it. My heart feels pain for the creek, like my own blood is mingled with oil. Papa walks up behind me and gasps. “Oh no!” He falls to his knees and covers his mouth with his hands, staring in horror. I fall to my knees beside him and bury my head in his stained white shirt. We hold each other as our tears fall, our river of tears making its way down to the creek, joining the flow of water and oil. All we can do is hope that our tears will wash away some of the oil. That one fish in there could breathe in the water from our tears instead of that oil. When the final school bell of the day rings, my friend Alicia and I run outside with the rest of the students. The blue sky is bright and clear. The sun glints off of the solar panels that workers are now installing on the roof of our middle school. We watch for a moment in awe as the solar panels are lifted and secured into place by strong people in green vests. We walk down to the Green New Community Farm, where vast fields are lush with green plants of all kinds. We each grab a small wicker basket and walk over to the strawberry patch. We pluck the juicy berries off their stems, laughing to the sun’s sweet melody. When nobody’s looking, I take a bite, the telltale juice running down my chin and filling my mouth with heaven. We run up to the table where they’re handing out bags of produce to a line of people with ragged clothes and weary eyes. A man at the front with wrinkled skin takes a bag of produce with shaking hands as he leans on his walker. I hand him my small basket of strawberries. He takes one, closes his eyes, and slowly and methodically takes a bite. “Oh sweet heaven! How I have missed fresh strawberries! Thank you, girl.” He places the basket of strawberries in his walker. Leaning on his walker, he slowly walks away, all the while saying, “Mm mm mm.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/10/21/marine-protected-areas-status-quo/,"It’s bizarre to think that billions of phytoplankton floating across the oceans are keeping us all alive. These remarkable microscopic plants produce more than half of Earth's oxygen, they draw over 100 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the oceans every day, and form the base of a food chain for all marine life. That’s some impressive multi-tasking. Phytoplankton, NOAA The diversity of life on land is astonishing enough; in the oceans it’s unimaginable. For an illustrative peek under the surface; there are over 8,500 known species of sponges, more than 50,000 of crustaceans, and at least 85,000 of molluscs. Distinguished marine biologist Professor Frederick Grassle estimated the number of marine species to be between one and ten million. Ocean life ranges from bacteria just thousandths of a millimetre wide, to a blue whale 108 feet long (33 meters) weighing 220 tons; from a frigate bird soaring two-and-a-half miles above the sea’s surface, to a snailfish living over five miles below it. As well as being home to an immeasurable diversity of life, oceans are vital in regulating global climate systems. Their currents distribute the sun’s heat, moderating temperatures and keeping the land habitable. Oceans are also a powerhouse of everlasting clean energy which can be harnessed to replace fossil fuels, so they can play a crucial role in society’s transition to a green and equitable economy. New antibiotics and drugs to treat cancer, HIV, and malaria are being developed from marine organisms. Over 200 million people are directly or indirectly employed in marine fisheries and approximately three billion people depend on seafood as their main source of protein. Healthy, life-filled oceans give us food, livelihoods, energy, medicine, hospitable climates, and even the air we breathe. In short, they make all life on Earth possible. But, as we know, the oceans are in trouble, beset by a daunting range of threats. This article looks at some of the approaches being taken to tackle them – such as creating marine protected areas and coastal communities taking grassroots action – and asks: are these approaches sufficient? And, if not: what more can we do to defend the sea, in the face of an escalating climate and ecological emergency? Frigate bird, Lorenzo Mittiga, Ocean Image Bank. Despite our complete dependence on them, the world’s coasts and oceans have endured our destructive ways for centuries, and since industrialisation, the damage we cause has accelerated. The way people are using the sea and exploiting its resources is destroying precious undersea and coastal habitats; causing mass cruelty, distress, and death to wildlife; and exacerbating the climate crisis. These are the shameful truths of our relationship with the sea – showing neither an essential respect for nature, nor basic common sense. • Wasteful, illegal, and destructive fishing, where 30 percent of commercial fish species are overfished and 38.5 million tons of accidental by-catch is killed each year; • The harm to marine life caused by underwater noise from shipping, sonar, and mining • The many tons of discarded fishing gear left in the sea; • The practice of bottom trawling – where fishing boats drag heavy nets along seabeds – releasing huge quantities of carbon dioxide; • Contaminant and damaging fish-farming; • The millions of sharks killed for their fins; • Seabed mining; • Human rights abuses and corruption. Serious problems also stem from what happens on land: by agricultural run-off, industrial discharge, and plastic waste polluting rivers and seas; and by the effects of burning fossil-fuels, which lead to seas warming, ice-caps melting, sea levels rising, more extreme weather events, and ocean acidification. It amounts to a sprawling, multi-front ocean onslaught. Nicolas Job,Ocean Image Bank. The burning question is: how can we protect coasts, oceans and marine life more effectively than we have done so far? Creating marine protected areas and marine reserves is widely regarded as the best way to defend the sea from further harm. In a marine protected area (MPA), activities such as fishing and dredging are restricted, while in a marine reserve, everything is fully protected and commercial activities are permanently prohibited (they’re also called “no-take” zones). Nature recovers surprisingly quickly if it’s left alone; and when sea waters are undisturbed, life returns — frequently in abundance. In Tortugas Ecological Reserve in Florida, for instance, scallops increased fourteen-fold after five years of protection. A study published in 2009 found that on average, biomass (the mass of animals and plants) more than quadrupled over three years within a marine reserve. However, nature’s recovery can take much longer, as the story of Monterey Bay illustrates. As well as the ecological benefits, marine reserves bring economic and social advantages. Older, larger fish tend to produce far more eggs than smaller, younger ones. By providing a safe haven where they can mature and reproduce, fish populations swell and may boost the catches of fisheries in nearby waters. Renata Romeo, Ocean Image Bank. Over the years, scientists and conservation NGOs have been steadily raising the marine protection target, and today they are calling for 30 percent of the global oceans to be kept safe within a global network of MPAs. However, there are drawbacks to designating marine protected areas as the solution to this global problem: Due to the very nature of water and marine life – in particular, their mobility and unpredictability – applying land-based thinking to the sea as a conservation strategy has limited success, unless the protected area is very large. The plastic waste and pollutants we want to keep out, or the wildlife we want to keep in, pay no attention to boundaries on a map. Sharks for instance, may be safe from the shark-finners within a reserve, but not when they swim outside it. Establishing a reserve or marine protected area can be a long-winded process, fraught with bureaucratic obstacles. There is always opposition from various sectors, such as the oil, gas, and aggregate dredging industries, and too often governments defer to their demands. Most commonly, resistance comes from the fishing industry, even though the evidence shows that having protected areas leads to greater numbers of fish for the industry to catch and sell. Because our understanding of marine ecosystems is incomplete, there is also the issue of where best to designate an MPA or marine reserve and how big it should be. The life stages of many marine species occur in different locations, which can thwart efforts to protect them. One stage may happen within a reserve, while the next could occur in adjacent unprotected waters. An example is the Caribbean Spiny Lobster, which lives in a variety of habitats during its life, including mangroves, reefs and the open ocean. Although there are thousands of protected areas around the world, few are large enough to be very effective. Their location may also be determined by wherever is least inconvenient for industries like fishing and oil exploration, and not by the area’s ecological importance, which smacks of environmental tokenism. In these cases, economic interests are still overriding the essentiality of nature, indicating that policy-making priorities haven’t moved forward. Many MPAs and reserves are ‘protected’ in name only and provide no more protection than in the rest of the sea. It could be that regulations aren’t monitored and enforced; or that there’s no management plan in place; or, that restrictions on human activities are so minimal that they make no difference. While recognising how valuable marine protected areas can be, their fundamental shortcoming as a conservation strategy is that safeguarding parcels of water doesn’t address the problem we’re trying to solve. It doesn’t stop the existential threats to the oceans. Top-down partial protection policies help maintain the status quo, because they allow over-extractive and often barbaric commercial practices to continue beyond the boundaries of protected areas. Looking beyond those boundaries is essential if we are to safeguard the seas. Thijs Stoop, Unsplash If we can plan to protect a third of the oceans, we can plan to protect all of them. Seas will still be fished, cargo shipped across them, jobs created and profits made, but the way industries and communities use the sea would be carefully regulated and restricted in order to safeguard all marine environments and their wildlife. Law enforcement systems and technologies have been available for several years and are steadily advancing. With commercial fishing for instance, compliance controls include fitting vessels with a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) to monitor activity and track their positions at sea; independent observers on board; patrol ships in operation; strict licensing rules; and a catch documentation program to prove that fish were caught legally. These are some of the measures used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to control commercial fishing and maintain healthy ecosystems in the Southern Ocean. Before I’m labelled an idealist, consider this: the world’s oceans and marine life are already protected by international law. Several conservation agreements are in place, such as the UN Fish Stocks Agreement; the Convention on Biodiversity; the UN World Charter for Nature; the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; the International Whaling Commission; the Antarctic Treaty – and since 1994, by the United Nations Law of the Sea – specifically by Articles 61, 117-120, 192-216 and 242-244 (1). “States have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment… [and]...take all measures necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment. [They must] protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species and other forms of marine life” and should work together to agree on “international rules, standards and recommended practices… for the protection and preservation of the marine environment.” Excerpts taken from the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas, Articles 192, 194, 196 & 197. (1) Davi Mendes, Unsplash. You may be wondering: if we have laws to protect them, why are the oceans facing so many threats? The answer is: ignored and unenforced law is much the same as having no law. As with other environmental protection commitments, (such as the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the Convention on Biological Diversity targets to stop the loss of biodiversity) governments, perpetually under pressure from corporate lobbyists, have mostly reneged on their targets and assurances to ensure citizens have safe and habitable environments in which to live, and enable nature to regenerate and flourish Thankfully, there are exceptions. The Montreal Protocol is the international treaty agreed to end the production of substances that were breaking up the ozone layer, the stratospheric mantle that shields Earth from the Sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. It’s widely considered to be the most successful environmental treaty, having phased out over ninety-five percent of the ozone-harming chemicals. It’s also the first United Nations treaty with the participation of all countries and has almost full compliance. The Montreal Protocol shows that it is possible for the global community to pull together and take relatively swift action to protect the natural world – a fact that’s both encouraging and exasperating in equal measure. In the absence of sufficient state intervention, people find other ways to solve problems, or to safeguard their ways of life. In many coastal communities people are protecting inshore fisheries and marine habitats themselves. Locally led marine management (also called community-based marine conservation) is a citizen-driven movement which began in Fiji in the 1990s. Years of uncontrolled commercial fishing, of pollution, and of removing live corals and tropical fish for the aquarium market, had left much of Fiji’s seas and their wildlife in decline. Residents in the village of Ucunivanua decided to take action. They closed off 60 acres of nearby mudflats and sea-grass beds for three years. It was to be Fiji’s first locally managed marine area (LMMA) and the difference it made was dramatic. Within seven years clam populations increased 24 times over. The notion that ‘experts’ – scientists, managers, and politicians – know best, was debunked. Fishers and other members of the community were making management decisions, based on their needs, their priorities, and their ecological knowledge. News of Ucunivanua’s initiative spread around Fiji and prompted others to follow suit. Success has been breeding success, and the locally managed marine conservation model has moved way beyond Fijian shores. King Penguins of the Southern Ocean. Paul Carroll, Unsplash. Similar projects are running over the South Pacific, to Indonesia, the Philippines, across the Southern Hemisphere from India to Kenya, Mozambique, and Madagascar, as far as South America and Central America, to Mexico and Canada, and from North Africa to Europe. Grassroots marine conservation is a very positive development in the battle to rescue and conserve the oceans, and as it gathers momentum, may be achieving more than the well-intentioned international agreements which all too often, governments across the world then disregard. From the South Pacific again, comes more good news for the sea. Recently, the small South Pacific island state of Niue made the bold move to designate all of its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) a protected area — which covers a generous 317,500 sq km (122,000 sq miles) of the Pacific ocean. Previously, the Cook Islands and Palau took similar steps, effectively outlawing damaging practices in 100 percent of their waters. These island nations are providing a working model of ocean protection which could eventually be rolled out globally. For the natural world as a whole, light is on the horizon in South America. Ecuador has enshrined the Rights of Nature into the constitution, and Bolivia passed the Law of Mother Nature to 'establish the vision and fundamentals of integral development in harmony and balance with Mother Earth to live well’. Spotted eagle rays. Amanda Cotton, Ocean Image Bank. There are many cases of new laws bringing about more enlightened societal norms and attitudes, from relatively small improvements like banning smoking in public spaces, to major advances such as outlawing child labour and slavery. And, although we are at an early stage of change, states beginning to recognise and defend nature’s rights is a major step in the right direction. It follows that by putting protective laws into practice, society is likely to become more respectful and appreciative of the oceans and their wildlife. Everything people have to do with the sea can be based on a simple universal principle: to use all of it responsibly – without emptying or polluting waters, without wrecking marine habitats, without needlessly killing millions of wild animals. As coasts and oceans regenerate, waters will become cleaner and fill with fish to eat, to sell and crucially, to reproduce. Undersea habitats can recover, large-scale cruelty can end, wildlife can return, and coastal communities reliant on the sea can prosper. In simple terms, it’s time to ditch the paradigm of plunder and protect the whole lot. Most of us know about the plague of plastic in the sea and the importance of cutting out single-use plastics, but here are six more actions you could take: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1) The USA took part in the Law of the Sea negotiations and signed the agreement, but hasn’t yet ratified the treaty because of limits put on deep seabed mining. However, the US follows the Law of the Sea as customary international law. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Deb Rowan Wright is a researcher and writer on ocean conservation policy.

Photo: Juho Kim This issue: Rebellion in Berlin, Oslo, Boston | Croatia Climate Camp | Iran Protests Dear rebel, Rebellion season has begun! In this issue you’ll find reports of not one but three rebel uprisings - in Germany, Norway, and America. Want to know why police struggled all evening to remove a piano from the streets of Berlin? How the rebellion in Oslo had to accommodate military training exercises? Or how rebels froze rush hour traffic right across Boston? Scroll on down to Action Highlights. There you’ll also find a report on Croatia’s first ever Climate Camp, which concluded with a daring rebel blockade of a nearby gas terminal. Women have led the uprising in Iran. Find out why in Solidarity Corner. This issue, we also introduce Solidarity Corner - a space to explore protests outside our movement that nevertheless deserve our support. We investigate the mass protests in Iran that were sparked by the murder of a young woman in police custody. Finally, in Humans of XR we hear from a rebel who has just finished an epic 4000 km trek from the southern Spanish city of Granada to the permafrost of Northern Finland. While the rebellions keep coming, so too does the extreme weather. In the last month we have seen lives and livelihoods lost to floods in Nigeria, drought in Somalia, and hurricanes in the Caribbean and coasts of North America. Am I only dreaming? Is irony dead? Is this really the best our overlords have to offer? New research emphasises that it’s the rich and powerful (and their financial investments) that are most responsible for rising carbon emissions. With world leaders weeks away from meeting in Egypt for COP27, the mainstream media will soon be proclaiming all kinds of breakthrough deals and solemn pledges. But they will be made in an event sponsored by Coca-Cola (the world’s worst plastic polluter) and hosted by a country where political protest gets you tortured.

Photo: Stefan Müller Picture the scene: a police bulldozer knocks into a towering pink oil rig, stood in the centre of Berlin. The three-metre-tall rig crashes to the ground, and rebel onlookers cheer! Finally, the German government’s fossil fuel addiction has come to an end! This symbolic moment was brought to you by the Herbstrebellion, Berlin’s Autumn Rebellion, which rallied more than 350 activists from across Germany and beyond. Rebels pitched their tents in a park close to the ministries that are the beating heart of German politics. The colourful camp offered training, workshops, and most importantly, hot food and tea (urgently needed during the cold, rainy days of early autumn). It quickly became home to the rebels involved in the four days of action. The utopian street party. Police weren’t invited, but turned up anyway. Photo: Stefan Müller The rebellion kicked off with the creation of a traffic-free utopia on a busy intersection. While haystacks and banners blocked traffic, XR offered a glimpse of what urban life without cars could look like. Music was performed from the roof of a pink trailer, people danced in the middle of the street, a mobile kitchen provided food, and an open piano let people investigate their musical talent. Police didn’t wait long to crash the party. Many rebels resisted by simply sitting down, forcing the police to carry them off one by one. But it was the piano that proved to be the true master of disruption. Its lack of wheels and novel human attachments (two glued-on rebels) kept the police busy late into the evening. A piano made for tinkling, jamming and serious disruption. Photo: Tenzin Heatherbell Two days later, the pink oil rig blocked a street near the Ministry of the Environment, with rebels glued to it top-to-bottom. The Oil-Heads performed an artistic indictment of our addiction to fossil fuels, the rain poured for hours, and the police finally swept in to send everyone home. Rebels later blockaded the headquarters of the Green Party, who are part of the country’s current coalition government. They condemned its continuing support for investments in fossil fuels, and its tired adherence to economic growth. For one Berlin rebel, the rebellion showed XR’s continued unity and strength: “Many local groups in Germany were weakened during the pandemic. These actions brought them together, provided a moment where they could see they’re not alone. A lot of people still have energy and want to change things. XR is still very much alive.” Find out more about XR Germany on their website and on Twitter. 20 - 27 SEP | Oslo, Norway Rebels lock-on to the tracks to stop a train carrying jet fuel reach Oslo’s airport. The action planners of XR Norway were out of luck: their scheduled rebellion fell on the same week as large-scale military training across Oslo. Lawyers warned that disrupting a military drill could lead to years in prison. Whether by coincidence or design, their rebellion plan would have to be quickly altered. Thankfully, rebels from across Norway still came together to launch a series of successful actions. First up was a blockade both inside and outside the Norwegian Ministry of Oil and Energy, organised by XR Youth Norway. The protest targeted state-owned oil company Equinor for its ecocidal extraction of Argentine shale oil, and more specifically, its planned exploration of Vaca Muerta. The shale oil-rich region is home to the indigenous Mapuche people, and a representative joined the young rebels outside the ministry. XR Youth Norway and a Mapuche spokesperson outside the Norwegian Ministry of Oil and Energy. More rebels occupied the lobby inside. Tensions were high as soldiers moved around the area, but police ended up only arresting five rebels, a surprisingly low number for Norwegian police, and a clear shift away from repressive older tactics. Days later, rebels blocked a 300-metre-long train transporting jet fuel from Oslo’s harbour to its airport, with a separate outreach team engaging the jet-setters inside the airport. Although the rebels on the train tracks did agree to unlock themselves, the police were again unexpectedly lenient. Not a single arrest was made. The protests culminated in a six-hour-long blockade outside Oslo’s courthouse, where a fellow rebel’s trial was underway. The verdict - a suspended jail term and a hefty fine, marking an escalation of the state’s punishment of peaceful protest. At the same time, the peaceful protest outside the courthouse was tolerated. Overall, for reasons out of XR Norway’s control, this was a subdued rebellion that didn’t capture the media attention of previous uprisings. But do not worry - Norwegian rebels are undeterred in their fight against fossil fuel dependency. Follow XR Norway on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. 17 - 25 SEP | Boston, USA Rebels march onto the bridge despite state and city police outnumbering them. Photo: David L Ryan / Boston Globe More than 50 rebels blockaded a major bridge into downtown Boston, disrupting rush hour traffic across the city, as separate groups marched to the bridge from different locations. Despite a heavy police presence (after details of the action were leaked via the media) the blockade lasted over two hours. 15 rebels were arrested and released on bail. All now face court hearings and further fines. Police also seized two vehicles that rebels used to block traffic, one of which still contained protest supplies. There was chanting, speeches and music before a 40-foot banner was unfurled. The action was part of XR Boston’s Week of Rebellion, nine consecutive days of rebel action and events. Activists from across Massachusetts converged on the city to demand that the state ban new fossil fuel infrastructure. Massachusetts has already greenlit the construction of a new natural gas and diesel-fired power plant in the region, and is reviewing plans for a Boston energy company to invest up to $65m in a new gas pipeline. A rebel pastes artwork along ‘Graffiti Alley’ in Boston’s Central Square. Other highlights from the Week of Rebellion included a special teach-in on Boston harbour by Scientist Rebellion, with talks on climate tipping points from an atmospheric physicist and climate scientists. Rebels also rallied on the steps of the State House to demand climate justice for all, held a mass bike ride through the city to coincide with World Car Free Day, and pasted XR artworks across Boston’s Central Square. Follow XR Boston on Twitter and donate to their post-rebellion fundraiser. 14 - 18 SEP | Krk, Croatia Climate Campers blockade the entrance to a new gas terminal on the island of Krk. XR Zagreb has held a five-day climate camp - the first in Croatia’s history - and finished it with an improvised action at a nearby gas terminal. 80 activists from right across Europe, and even one from America, attended the Adriatic Climate Camp on a beautiful island off Croatia’s coast. Participants got to share skills, attend legal training, and bond with their fellow activists. There was plenty of non-protest stuff too, like drumming sessions and a bike repair workshop. Not far from where the camp was held, stood a brand new state-owned gas terminal. It was built to receive gas imported from the United States, replacing the gas that was once piped in from Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine should have been the wake-up call that finally got Europe to transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, governments like Croatia’s have scrambled to import dirty fuels from elsewhere. Rebels from France, Italy, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Russia, Austria, Germany, Lithuania, UK and the US settle down for a climate camp lunch. 50 climate campers decided to take a stand. Unfortunately, the campsite owners tipped off the police, and officers were waiting for the activists at the terminal, along with a police boat and a private security boat armed with a water cannon. The brave rebels still managed to blockade the terminal’s entrance for two hours. And a few plucky campers decided to try and swim to the terminal, though the boats and strong winds quickly pushed them back. XR Zagreb was established in 2020 when local scientists’ demands for climate action were ignored by politicians. The small but hard-working group has organised over 30 protests since then, including two climate marches in the past year. The Adriatic Climate Camp was a huge success and covered by news media across the Balkans. XR Zagreb is already making plans for a second camp next year. Follow XR Zagreb on Facebook and Instagram. 24 SEP | Seoul, South Korea: The Red Rebel Brigade appeared at a Global Climate Strike rally through the city. Thousands of Korean activists from over 150 environmental organisations took part in the rally. For more Global Climate Strike action around the world, check out this month’s Newsletter XTRA.

The music, talks, and artistic performances called on the government to cancel their recent auctions for drilling rights. 27 SEP | The Hague, Netherlands: Rebels joined an alliance of activists outside the office of Total. In solidarity with Ugandan and Tanzanian communities, they protested the ecocidal East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). 1 OCT | London, UK: Rebels joined Just Stop Oil activists, worker’s unions and other community organisations to protest the cost-of-living crisis sweeping the UK. Energy prices are sky-high thanks to gross government mismanagement. Activists occupied 3 bridges before moving on to parliament. Just Stop Oil vowed to return each day of October until the government changed course. Over 100 activists have been arrested so far. 4 OCT | Cape Town, South Africa: Rebels protest outside Africa Oil Week - an annual conference where the oil and gas industry makes dirty deals with government ministers to exploit the continent's oil and gas resources. 4 OCT | Kampala, Uganda: Police arrest and bundle nine university students into a jeep during a peaceful street protest against EACOP. The activists were denied bail and imprisoned by the local court pending trial, but allowed out on bail 6 days later. 5 OCT | Rome, Italy: A rebel from Ultima Generazione ends his hunger strike after an incredible 26 days. He wanted an audience with the country’s newly elected leaders, but received only assurances that his letter of demands would be passed on to them. Ultima Generazione launched a wave of roadblocks in disgust at their politicians’ indifference. So many rebel actions happened this month, we can’t fit them all into one newsletter.

Newsletter XTRA: A feast for the eyes and extra fuel for the soul! Newsletter XTRA School girls in Iran remove their hijabs. One holds a sign saying ‘Woman. Life. Freedom’ - the rallying cry of the uprising. Photo: @discotehran.nyc Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, was visiting Tehran with her family when she was arrested by Iran’s ‘morality’ police. She was not covering her head ‘properly’ and was taken to a detention centre where she was beaten into a coma. Three days later, she died from the assault. Her murder reignited the fight for women’s freedom in Iran, which was further fuelled by simmering anger at the dire economic situation brought on by international sanctions. Within hours of her killing, people flooded the streets protesting the government’s mandatory hijab laws. Protesters released videos of women burning their hijabs, encircled by a cordon of men protecting them, and of women boldly walking through Tehran’s streets with their heads uncovered. Iranian women burn their hijabs on the streets of Tehran. Photo: @discotehran.nyc Videos emerged of women solemnly cutting their hair over the coffins and graves of loved ones killed by state authorities, both a traditional sign of mourning and a signal of defiance towards the government. The protests have evolved into a broader call for an overhaul of the government. They continue to be led by women and, more recently, school girls. Unlike other recent protests in Iran, they cut across class, ethnic, and geographic lines. The government’s response has been swift and brutal. The Internet was quickly shut down, and under the veil of technological darkness authorities have arrested protesters en masse, torturing and killing many. The recent rape and killing of two teenage girls has only strengthened the protesters’ resolve to continue their uprising. Two Iranian women defiantly eat in a restaurant with their heads uncovered. Photo: @discotehran.nyc The Iranian women’s uprising has quickly drawn support from around the world. Iranian women in diaspora held rallies globally to back the protests, and celebrities and politicians publicly cut their hair in solidarity with Iranians’ struggle for freedom. Calls of “Woman. Life. Freedom.” have been ringing across the world for nearly a month now, with no sign of quieting. While there are many speculations as to how this uprising may be resolved, one thing is certain - these women-led protests are not new, but part of a generational fight for freedom. My name is Marta, I am an artist, PhD student, and an activist for XR and Scientist Rebellion. I have been heavily involved with XR since early 2019, when it emerged in the UK. I immediately knew it was the movement we needed. The current impacts of the climate crisis, such as the heatwaves, droughts, and floods, are so extreme that I did not expect to face them until much later, perhaps at the end of my existence. The evidence is clear. We have just a few years to mitigate the worst case-scenarios of this catastrophe. That is why I decided to fully dedicate my life to civil resistance, to force a radical system change through disobedience and nonviolent direct action. As an artist, I understand how artistic practices can be vehicles that transform life, our relationship with ourselves, society, and the natural world. My PhD research focuses on this. I am currently at the end of an art and activism project called ‘2020: The Walk’ in which I travelled mostly on foot all the way from Granada to the permafrost of north Finland. During the 4000 kilometre-long journey I have connected with fellow rebels and other activists, and raised awareness of the no-fly movement as well as XR. ‘2020: The Walk’ is being documented on video, a soon-to-be-published book, and on social media in collaboration with the artist Oscar Martín, who accompanied me on the walk. The walk was supposed to start in 2020, but was postponed due to the pandemic. We finally departed from Granada in April of this year, and I write this from an artist residency in north Finland, where we are going to film the last scenes of ‘2020: The Walk’ in the permafrost. The walk will officially conclude later this year with an action in Germany with Scientist Rebellion. During my years in XR, I have been incredibly inspired by the commitment of other rebels, united by a fierce love of life and the values that preserve it. We are all interdependent beings, and we need each other.

Photo: Stimson Center In this issue: Swedish Uprising | Hamburg Gas Blockade | Pakistan Is Our Story | Dear rebel, The spring brought the people of Pakistan an extreme heatwave. The summer has brought them devastating floods. Thousands have died, half a million have been displaced, and nearly half the country’s crops have washed away, causing vegetable prices to spike by 500%. Now the country faces a food crisis as well as more rain. Relentless extreme weather and high food prices have also displaced hundreds of thousands in Somalia. The UN has stated unequivocally that “famine is at the door” after the unprecedented failure of four rainy seasons. The death toll could be worse than in 2010, when over a quarter of a million starved to death, half of them children. Today, millions are living through a hellscape of unending extreme weather, and on a planet that has ‘only’ warmed 1.2 °C. How many millions more must join them? In Indonesia, the recent G20 climate talks ended in stalemate, with previously agreed references to limiting warming to 1.5 °C now being rejected by China, among others. Pakistan solidarity actions were launched by a global coalition of activists, including rebels. Find out more in Action Roundup. This one was by APMDD in the Philippines. Yet China is suffering its own unprecedented summer, with an extreme drought putting its autumn harvest under “severe threat”. Meanwhile, new research indicates that exceeding 1.5 °C of warming could trigger multiple climate tipping points. Once again, the case for rebellion is resoundingly made. So you’ll be pleased to know that brave and brilliant rebellion is what you’ll find below. In Action Highlights we show how rebels in Sweden braved arrest, detainment, and even deportation while making climate change an issue in their national elections. We also report on how German rebels used a concrete bathtub to help Ende Gelände blockade a major oil and gas port in Hamburg. Sadly, there was a brutal police response there as well. And don’t miss this month’s Humans of XR, an inspiring interview with a relentless rebel and Debt For Climate activist in South Africa. German police used water cannon, mace, batons, punches, and kicks to break up a peaceful blockade of Hamburg’s port. This month we also expected to bring you news of rebellion in London. But after the death of the British Queen, and the ensuing ten days of national mourning, XR UK made the difficult decision to postpone its Festival of Resistance.

Support the Rebellion 16 - 22 AUG | Stockholm, Sweden A rebel is led away during a protest highlighting cyclist deaths in Sweden’s capital. In the weeks leading up to Sweden’s general election, rebels took to the streets of Stockholm and beyond to ensure that the climate emergency was not ignored by their campaigning politicians. The police took unprecedented steps to stop them. Rebels joined forces with activists from ‘Restore Wetlands’ to block traffic on Stockholm’s major roads. As they glued their hands to the tarmac, they demanded an end to fossil fuel subsidies, and the restoration of Sweden’s vital wetlands (more than 65% of the nation's wetlands have been destroyed by human activity). Twelve Restore Wetlands activists were arrested on suspicion of sabotage. The road blockades culminated with the blocking of a major highway out of Stockholm, which also involved Finnish rebels and German activists from Letzte Generation. The police not only arrested activists this time, but also journalists, forcing one to strip naked in his cell. Clockwise from top left: XR rebels blocking a major road in Stockholm; rebels invite themselves into a Volvo showroom; the ‘Rebellmammorna’ occupy the city centre; rebels being pulled off the road by police. Days later, six Finnish activists were arrested by Swedish border police while travelling to an action at a concrete factory on Gotland Island. One man was detained for four days before being deported. He is banned from entering Sweden for two years. This rebellion marks the first time a climate activist has been arrested in Sweden, let alone deported. XR Sweden is frightened not just by the startling increase in state repression, but by the muted response to it in Swedish society at large. Despite the excessive policing and unjust detentions, Swedish rebels and their allies ensured rebellion continued. Trade was brought to a halt at a Volvo showroom to protest ballooning SUV sales. Cyclists staged a die in outside the Swedish Transport Authority to highlight the cyclist deaths caused by limited cycle routes and rampant car use. And a new XR group sprang up: Rebellmammorna (Rebel Mothers). Dozens of mothers sat down in the centre of Stockholm to express their rage and fear for their children’s futures, and the lives of all children across the globe.

German rebels joined forces with Ende Gelände (meaning ‘Here and No Further’) for several days of action in Hamburg, culminating in a blockade of the city's port, a major fossil fuel transit point. With temperatures soaring above 30 degrees, around thirty rebels blocked Koehlbrand bridge, a key access route to the port, dragging an upturned bathtub filled with concrete from a van before locking their arms within it. It took police about four hours to pull them free. Meanwhile, about two thousand Ende Gelände activists and affiliates blocked other rail and road connections to the port. The police response was violent: protesters were assaulted with water cannons, mace and tear gas, as well as with physical brutality. Several activists had to be treated in hospital as a result of the violence. The port was disrupted for a total of nine hours. Police fire water cannons at Ende Gelände activists as they block a bridge into the Port of Hamburg. The umbrellas were brought as protection from the scorching sun. Other actions in the campaign included city marches, the disruption of a gas pipeline construction sites, and the blockade of a gas-guzzling fertiliser plant. Between actions, Ende Gelände’s grand coalition of activists came together for a week-long climate camp offering training and workshops on anti-colonialism, post-capitalism, and climate justice. Ende Gelände is at the forefront of Germany’s climate movements. Founded in 2015, their focus is on an immediate phasing-out of fossil fuels, with a recent shift in focus from lignite coal to liquified natural gas (LNG). Instead of using public spaces as a platform for civil disobedience, they directly target sites of extractivism. The war in Ukraine has caused an increased reliance on fossil fuels across Europe, with Germany now using coal for nearly a third of its energy. The German government recently announced its plans to build several new LNG terminals, which would lock the country into decades more of dependence on fossil fuels.

The action was organised by This Is Our Story, a new group specialising in rapid solidarity actions after climate disasters. Top left to bottom right: Tokyo, Nuremberg, Istanbul, Rutshuru DRC. 2 - 4 SEP | Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Forty rebels disrupted the festivities of World Port Days. One fifth of Dutch carbon emissions are produced by Rotterdam, 88% of them by its port, the largest seaport in Europe and the largest outside East Asia. 3 SEP | Kyavinyonge, Democratic Republic of Congo: Rebels from the University of Goma were at the town of Kyavinyonge on the shores of Lake Edward to raise public awareness of the harmful impacts of oil exploitation on the Virunga National Park. 21 AUG | Krakow, Poland: Rebels joined a silent march along the river Vistula to protest the ecological catastrophe that occurred to the river Oder. Over 200 tonnes of dead fish have been recovered from its waters. The official cause is still unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of toxic spillage and low oxygen due to the heatwaves and droughts. 11 AUG | Toulouse, France: Activists from the Kirikou Collective (which includes rebels) are demanding that France’s golf courses stop monopolising water during times of extreme drought. They cemented up holes and damaged greens to denounce the way the elite leisure industry continues to be given special status. 21 JUNE | Barcelona, Spain: Around 50 rebels blockaded and occupied the headquarters of Santander - the Spanish bank that invests the most in the fossil fuel industry. The protest ended peacefully, but some rebels were identified by police and could be fined. So many rebel actions happened this month, we can’t fit them all into one newsletter.

Photo: Markus Spiske This month we’ve got the new research paper showing how exceeding 1.5 °C could spell climate meltdown, an investigation into whether personal change is necessary to curb the climate crisis, a ‘hot take’ on the floods destroying Pakistan, and a report on a forgotten and savage war of the British Empire that was all about extracting rubber. Science: Exceeding 1.5 °C Could Trigger Multiple Climate Tipping PointsAn updated assessment of the most important climate tipping points, showing that even the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 °C and preferably 1.5 °C is not safe. XR Global Blog: Is Climate Change Your Fault?Can individual lifestyle change help to tackle the climate and ecological emergency, or is it an unhelpful distraction? XR Global Blog: Hot Take #3 - Pakistan Superfloods Hot Takes are short-form, in-depth reactions to pressing global issues. This one looks at the floods that have devastated Pakistan and how the Global North is culpable. Declassified: Britain’s Forgotten War For Rubber70 years ago, the UK stepped up a brutal colonial intervention in Malaya (now Malaysia), presenting it as a war against Chinese communism. It was actually about access to the region’s rubber. I grew up in a small town created by Apartheid, called Lenasia, near Soweto. I first felt a connection with nature as a boy scout, learning about resourcefulness, like how to survive and light a fire. Due to the political situation in the country, my parents took me out of school and I started to work at sixteen. My entire adult life I’ve worked in liberation movements and community activism. In 2014, I was trained by Al Gore as part of the Climate Reality program. I’m also a serial entrepreneur. I've tried many, many businesses in my life, especially in renewable energy; right now I run a solar installation business. The company generates a lot of cardboard, and I'm constantly collecting the cardboard so that we have enough resources to make posters. Right now, I could probably provide enough cardboard for a protest of about 500 people. I became interested in Extinction Rebellion immediately after it was launched. However, when they asked me: are you prepared to get arrested? I said maybe, but probably not. I think that demand is unrealistic for people in the Global South, but particularly people in Africa. You could get lost in the system. But I resonated with everything else; that we needed to declare a climate emergency; that we needed to take it much more seriously; that we couldn't trust governments to behave in the correct way or to tell the truth about the problem. I’m part of the XR Gauteng branch, and my main form of activism is to be a resource to many climate justice organisations. I'm quick to put my hand up and say listen, I can help you with this or that. I’m also one of the conveners of the Debt for Climate movement. Debt for Climate was really the continuation of a number of different conversations. On February 4th, we did an action called the Coastal Rebellion to highlight Shell’s seismic testing. People in 25 cities around the world participated. On March 24th, we had a related event on World Water day. Then thoughts of the obligation that the Global North has to the Global South came up. This climate debt, of 500 years of extractivism. And what if we had a global campaign that could call for the cancellation of the financial debt of the Global South? Debt for Climate’s primary objective is to turn climate debt into climate action; transform the climate debt of the Global North into Climate Action in the Global South. The next major focus of our campaign is the 14th and 15th of October, when the World Bank and IMF will be meeting for the first time since COVID in Washington, DC. And of course after that we will focus on COP27. The idea is to popularise the campaign so that it becomes a rallying call at COP27. In my free time, I am what you could call a “tinkerer”. I fiddle around with electronics and computers. Aside from recycling, I’ve recently started to garden so that I can teach other people how to grow their own food.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/09/12/hot-take-pakistan-superflood-action-justice/,"The floods that have devastated Pakistan in recent weeks are a direct result of the Global North’s reckless disregard for our climatic future and the lives of those most affected. At the end of August, rainfall in Pakistan was 500% higher than normal and the country’s glaciers melted at an unprecedented speed. This abnormal amount of rain is not absorbable by Pakistan’s land or infrastructure, resulting in the catastrophic floods we have witnessed. These extremes are the physical manifestation of the Global North’s irresponsible proliferation of emissions, as our delicately balanced climate breaks down. The continued extractive pollution and consequent rise in temperature is producing more extreme weather events, with the Global South bearing the brunt of it— so far. Action at the United States Capitol in solidarity with Pakistani communities affected by the floods. Photo credit: Extinction Rebellion Washington DC The devastating fallout from a third of one’s country being drowned is difficult for many of us to comprehend, with impacts both immediate and far-reaching. Of direct consequence is the epic loss of agricultural production and food; the provision of clean drinking water; the need to support an unfathomable 33 million people; providing prenatal care for 650,000 pregnant women (73,000 of whom are due this month); the resettling of Afghani refugees who had escaped to Pakistan; stopping the spread of waterborne diseases like diarrhoea, dengue, cholera, and malaria; tending to physical injuries and trauma; counting and burying the dead. The effects of these floods will reverberate in people’s lives for years to come as they and future generations struggle to recover income, homes, physical and mental health, emotional strength, communities, and revive the flooded land. Pakistan’s experience is devastating; but, unnervingly, it is not unique. It is one of many extreme weather events happening across the world, from the drought-induced famine ravaging the Horn of Africa and creating acute malnourishment in over 7 million children, to wildfires devouring forests across the west coast of America. It is a reminder that climate breakdown is already here, and a harbinger of what is to come. The wake of this disaster must point our moral compasses to solidarity, reparations, justice, and collective action. Pakistan contributes less than 1% of world emissions, and yet is among the countries most vulnerable to climate breakdown— most of which are ‘less’ or ‘least developed’ countries. The responsibility of this disaster, and others, lies squarely on the shoulders of countries in the Global North, who are flagrantly unwilling to stop their dependence on fossil fuels. Those of us living in the Global North need to increase the pressure on our governments to provide immediate help to the countries already being impacted most severely and others most vulnerable to climate threats. Alongside this we must continue demanding a rapid and just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Any yawning and blithering from the Global North about these catastrophes happening ‘over there’ must be met with the reminder that ‘over there’ is always ‘over here’— we are one global community and our future is inextricably tied to one another. The Global North must transform its mentality from one of ‘aid’ to one of a responsibility of reparations. The people of Pakistan deserve and need collective action centred on solidarity and justice to end fossil fuels right now. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/09/07/climate-change-your-fault/,"The role of individual lifestyle change in tackling the climate and ecological emergency (CEE) can be a controversial subject. Some argue that focusing on the individual is primarily a means to displace blame and distract from the most important actions necessary to tackle the CEE. On the other hand, at COP26, the renowned climate scientist Johan Rockstrom highlighted household behaviour changes as a crucial but often overlooked opportunity for climate action. Differing perspectives such as these can make lifestyle change an emotive subject, which can result in a reluctance to explore it. However, failure to consider these issues is likely to leave a gap in our understanding of both the causes of the CEE and the solutions. Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash Given this is a subject that creates a lot of heated debate, there are a few things I’d like to make explicit before going any further: This article does not advocate for individual lifestyle changes in preference to or as an alternative to the actions necessary to bring about systemic changes — it’s an exploration of the value of lifestyle change alongside the kind of systemic changes Extinction Rebellion (XR) is pushing for. Primary responsibility for taking the action necessary to tackle the CEE lies not with individuals, but with governments and businesses. Global fossil fuel subsidies almost doubled in 2021 and are expected to increase further in 2022. A 2017 report found that just 100 companies had been responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. Huge disparities exist between the environmental impact of richer countries (primarily in the Global North) and those in the Global South. The need for change is a function of how much we currently consume, so the poorest are not the ones who need to change; in many cases they could enjoy a higher standard of living without creating the same kind of adverse environmental impacts as the excessive consumption of the more affluent. Not everyone needs to change their lifestyle — it’s wealthier individuals with higher consumption lifestyles who need to make changes. Pushing governments and businesses to act now is where our energies have to be primarily focused. However, this doesn’t mean that individual actions are irrelevant or unimportant — they remain an essential part of the solution. The danger in placing all of the emphasis on governments and businesses is that it may invite people to conclude that what they do as individuals doesn’t really matter. Photo by Ma Ti on Unsplash Any such such conclusion is extremely problematic for two reasons — firstly, many aspects of the climate crisis are driven by actions that may not be viewed as material at an individual level, such as buying a plastic bottle of water, but are having a devastating impact when replicated more widely. The second reason is equity and climate justice — we currently have a situation where some people's lifestyles are contributing far more toward exacerbating the CEE than others; in many cases those contributing the least are suffering the worst consequences. There’s a clear moral case for those with the highest consumption lifestyles to make changes to address these inequalities — an argument that individual lifestyle choices don’t matter risks being used to diminish the importance of tackling these inequalities. It’s actually quite difficult to define boundaries for individual lifestyle change. This is because none of us exist in isolation — much of what we do involves interaction with others and rapidly drifts into the collective. A very simple definition is: “things we can do as an individual to help address the CEE”. This encompasses lifestyle and consumption choices, such as changing our diet, travelling less or in different ways, and reducing waste. It also includes actions such as making energy efficiency improvements to our home. Some individual choices will have very limited impact, but others will achieve more. The 1.5 Degree Lifestyles Report published by the ‘Hot or Cool’ think-tank, explores the main sources of emissions and how these vary between countries. Reducing our carbon footprint is an expression often used in relation to these kinds of lifestyle changes and you can find out more about that in this article. However, it’s important not to lose sight of all the other things we can do to reduce our negative environmental impact and alleviate aspects of the CEE. For example, rewilding a garden to provide a better habitat for insects and other animals can make an important contribution towards tackling the loss of biodiversity — and if enough people do this, it will have a much bigger impact. There are clearly many other things we can do as individuals beyond lifestyle changes — perhaps the best known example was Greta Thunberg’s school strike, which grew from a one-person protest into a massive global campaign. We can become more politically active or get involved in local community projects. However, many of these quickly blur the distinction between what we can do as individuals and collective activities involving others. All have important roles to play, but in this article I’m primarily focusing on the kind of individual lifestyle choices that some of us may be in the privileged position to make right now. Separating individual and more systemic changes can be both unnecessary and difficult to do — however, given the frequency with which questions such as “what can I do about climate change?”are asked, this remains an important issue to explore. The central reason for reservations about focusing on individual lifestyle change is the way in which it has been misused by some businesses and politicians. An article on the origins of anti-litter campaigns illustrates how companies shift the debate away from their own roles and responsibilities by exploiting a focus on individuals’ actions. Probably the most infamous example of this is BP's role in creating and promoting the concept of individual carbon footprints. In 2004, BP (British Petroleum) launched a carbon footprint calculator which was supposed to help people measure their own environmental impact and try to reduce it. Whilst this might sound like a good thing, it was seen by many as a cynical attempt to place the focus and responsibility for reducing emissions onto ordinary people. Meanwhile, BP continued producing massive amounts of pollution — in 2019, BP came sixth on a list of companies responsible for the most carbon emissions over the preceding five decades —producing over 34 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent during this period. Photo by Jay Skyler on Unsplash The fact that a focus on individual change has been misused in this way provides valid reasons for concern and scepticism. Too much focus on lifestyle change does have the potential to divert energy from achieving the systemic changes that are essential to tackle the CEE. However, this doesn’t alter the reality that individual choices can collectively have an impact. Further to be addressed are the massive disparities in individual’s contributions to creating the climate crisis; these are crucial to understanding and fighting the CEE and cannot be ignored. Those with the highest consumption and environmental impacts have the greatest opportunity and a responsibility to take action and make changes. XR aims to overcome the unwillingness of governments and businesses to take the action necessary to address the CEE. The primary method XR utilises to try and achieve this is mass civil disobedience; there are many historical examples which show how civil disobedience can be a very effective way of achieving change at the rapid speed demanded by the current crisis. XR does not focus on promoting lifestyle change as it doesn’t believe this represents the best way of achieving its aims at the pace required. There are a couple of other reasons why the subject of individual change is challenging for XR: XR does not advocate specific solutions to the CEE, as it believes these should be decided by Citizens' Assemblies (CAs). Promotion of specific changes by XR (at either the individual or systemic level) could, to some extent, entail pre-empting the decisions of the CA — for example, Animal Rebellion established itself as a separate entity to XR to enable it to advocate for specific changes in relation to diet and animal rights. Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash However, given the contribution of individual lifestyle and consumption choices to the CEE, an overall solution that does not involve significant changes in these areas is highly improbable. It could therefore be argued that supporting some forms of individual change as a general principle doesn’t directly conflict with the concept of CAs. XR has Ten Principles and Values, the eighth of which is: “We avoid blaming and shaming”. It goes on to say: “We live in a toxic system, but no one individual is to blame”. Whilst not necessarily in conflict with individual lifestyle change, the danger is that focusing on what we can do as individuals can very easily turn into blaming and shaming people for not making changes. As mentioned previously, the massive global inequalities in wealth that currently exist create huge disparities in individuals’ environmental impact. Those who have and consume the most are the ones with the greatest opportunity and responsibility to make changes. In this context, promotion of individual change in a way that avoids blaming and shaming isn’t easy. It’s also important to emphasise that another of XR’s principles is about welcoming everyone — there’s no requirement for individuals to make particular lifestyle choices in order to get involved with XR. However, it would be a mistake to infer from any of this that XR is somehow opposed to individual change or views it as having no value — individual change does have a critical role in creating solutions to the CEE. Individual lifestyle change and the kind of collective direct action to achieve systemic changes promoted by XR are not mutually exclusive or in opposition to each other. In reality, both provide part of the solution and they are complementary. Focusing purely on things we can do as individuals is never going to resolve the CEE, but they can make an important contribution — it only becomes negative if it distracts from or prevents other action. Whilst XR does not focus its energies on promoting individual change, most people within XR take actions on a daily basis that reduce their own environmental impact. It’s not about choosing one option over the other — we need to do both. What this article hopefully illustrates is that there aren’t clearly defined boundaries between individual and collective actions — we don’t exist in a vacuum and what we each do impacts on others. Trying to put different elements of the solution into boxes isn’t easy and doesn’t necessarily achieve much. We don’t need to wait for changes in legislation or for others to act. We may be able to make changes as an individual today. Individual behaviour changes can be the simplest way to make the transition from being a passive observer of the CEE to actively trying to prevent it. Taking an initial step, however small, can provide a stepping stone into other forms of activism and a way to connect with communities of like minded individuals. The impact of individual choices aren’t limited to their direct environmental impact — for example, choosing to ride a bicycle can achieve more than just the carbon reduction resulting from not driving: it’s healthier for you and others, and it’s cheaper. Taking climate action at both an individual and a collective or societal level can create multiple co-benefits. Photo by Vedant Shah on Pixabay When we make a conscious effort to change our behaviour it can help us see that change is possible and encourage us to do more. However, it’s essential that we’re realistic about how much impact our individual actions can have. We need to be careful not to devote so much time and energy to the minutiae that we lose sight of the big picture and the systemic changes that need to happen. We must never fool ourselves into thinking that a few small changes will be sufficient to tackle the CEE. In addition to the utilitarian argument which focuses purely on the outcome achieved, there’s also a moral argument for individual action. Prioritising our own needs above those of other life on our planet and future generations often creates feelings of guilt. Making different choices, even whilst acknowledging the limitations that making those changes may have, can help address these feelings. Doing something, however small, can make us feel better and help deal with climate anxiety and grief. This can be a good thing, as long as it doesn’t evolve into broader complacency and inaction. Making individual choices often involves educating ourselves about the CEE and the things that can be done to tackle it. Sometimes we’ll discover that the solutions aren’t something we can do much about as an individual, but in other cases we can. A positive aspect of educating ourselves, is that gaining a greater understanding of the harm resulting from our choices can make change much easier. One of the primary aims of the XR Global Blog is to raise awareness of the CEE by sharing perspectives from around the world — here’s some other recommended reading. Fully appreciating the negative impacts of our actions can shift the balance of pros and cons we associate with an activity — this can reduce our desire to engage in activities that have harmful impacts on the environment. Having a realistic view of how much impact our individual choices will actually make can also help prevent us from beating ourselves up too much about things we don’t manage to do. An appreciation of the limitations of individual lifestyle change can help us understand why other forms of action in order to achieve systemic changes remain essential. When we make changes as individuals, other people are likely to notice these changes, which can open up conversations. Such conversations provide an opportunity to raise awareness and educate others. People are often more likely to listen to and be influenced by friends, family members, neighbours, colleagues and other people they know and trust than complete strangers. Photo by Claudio Schwarz on Unsplash When we amend our own behaviour we also demonstrate that change is possible and can inspire others to take action. Modelling the change we want to see is known as “prefigurative politics” and has a really important role to play in starting conversations and shifting the Overton Window (a term used to describe the range of ideas perceived to be politically “safe” or acceptable). Through individual lifestyle choices we may be able to influence others to take similar action, or at least to consider possibilities outside their current frame of reference. In fact, research has shown that climate communicators and progressive policy advocates are more likely to be listened to if they are making lifestyle changes in addition to their work. Our influence isn’t limited to other individuals — we can also influence governments and businesses by demonstrating demand for policy change or more environmentally friendly alternatives. Returning to the opening question — “can individual lifestyle change help tackle the climate and ecological emergency or is it an unhelpful distraction?” — the answer is potentially yes to both! Individual lifestyle change does have an important role to play in tackling the CEE; however, we need to appreciate the limitations of what it can achieve, and not allow it to get in the way of other actions that are essential to tackle the CEE. Yes, some governments and businesses have tried to use lifestyle change to shift the debate away from the role they play — we need to be vigilant about avoiding falling into this trap — but at the same time this risk shouldn’t be overstated. These risks need to be considered alongside benefits of individual change, such as educating ourselves and influencing others. Lifestyle change also has a role to play in addressing climate injustice — the extreme inequalities that currently exist mean that a large proportion of the world’s population have neither the same need nor the ability to reduce their environmental impact as the most wealthy. Those with the highest consumption lifestyles have both the most opportunity and also the greatest moral responsibility to make lifestyle changes. The key point to re-emphasise is that whilst individual lifestyle changes from those with the highest consumption lifestyles are a necessary part of the solution, the primary focus has to be on pushing for the big systemic changes that are essential to prevent ecological and societal collapse. For example, shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy and defunding fossil capital is the kind of change that’s vital; this is down to governments and isn’t something we can achieve as individuals. We need to come together to pressure those in power to make these big changes, and that’s exactly what XR was created to do. So, thank you to everyone taking action to try and reduce their environmental impact. All of these efforts do matter, but they will never be sufficient on their own.

Original artwork was created for this story by Dustin Jacobus. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The tides rolled in. The tides rolled out. It was as simple as that. And in that simplicity there was power. Enough to light entire cities, even, not that Afton knew personally. Her little village did just fine, roaming the waves, but in her thirteen years she’d never seen the capital of the Floating Republic. She’d never walked on sidewalks so steady it was said you couldn’t even feel the rocking of the waves. For Afton, sea legs were the only legs she’d ever known. But today, that would change. Afton looked down at the scroll in her hands, her eyes hovering over the pliable screen. Her lips twitched, a subconscious reflex as she rehearsed her plan, her thoughts finding shape in the inaudible whispers escaping her mouth. Then a breeze blew a stray hair in her face and she suddenly became aware of herself, feeling the subtle burn of embarrassment in her cheeks and her eyes darted back and forth assessing whether anyone had seen her talking to herself, seen what was on her tablet. She darkened the screen and rolled up the scroll, tucking it into her belt and leaning against the rail of her ship, mind still turning as she lost herself for a moment in the horizon. “Ahoy there, matey! ” A voice boomed from behind her. “Be ye ready to see the great city?” Afton rolled her eyes as she turned towards the sound of footsteps. “You’re not going to talk like that in the city, are you?” “What be ye talking about? This be how all captains speak!” “Ayah. Seriously.” The Captain roared with laughter, rubbing his round belly. “Captain, come look at this,” came a voice. “Duty calls”, the Captain winked, his voice trailing after him as he scuttled off. “What have ye scallywags done now?” Afton rolled her eyes again, turning back to the ocean churning rhythmically below the bow of her community. Her young fingers traced the edges of the scroll secured in her belt for a moment, then slowly withdrew it. A sound caught her attention and her head snapped in the direction of the captain’s thunderous voice, still audible even from the adjacent deck. Afton shook her head and shoved the scroll back into her belt. Despite her father’s outwards demeanour, he always said it was a great privilege to be elected captain of a village. It was also a great privilege to be a captain’s daughter, and so Afton diligently bustled about her chores, inspecting rigging and cleaning solar panels as her village plowed through the waves. She checked in on the gardens, talking softly to the plants as she brushed the leaves with her fingers. She stopped by the ikat huts and brought tea to the weavers. She followed her father on a routine inspection of village. Even with the new carbon filaments, there was always thatching that could be done on the woven roofs of the many rumah adat of the village, from the conical Mbaru Niang of the Wae Rebo deck to the Batak Toba deck’s pointed gables. The entire village swayed on its half-submerged piles, and Afton skipped deftly from deck to deck along rope ladders and walkways, assisting with whatever tasks she could find, stopping only occasionally to smell yams and shrimp boiling in pots of aromatic spices. There were more than enough things to do in the village, more than enough distractions to keep her mind occupied. And yet, as she bustled from deck to deck, from chore to chore, she couldn’t help but become aware that the inner decks and structures were quickly emptying of people. There was an excitement sizzling throughout the village, a palpable energy that swept people away from their work like a riptide and ferried them to the village’s outer railings. It wouldn’t be long now. Afton tried to remain focused, to remain diligent. She tried to ignore the buzzing in the back of her mind, the itching in her fingers that seemed magnetically drawn to the scroll in her belt, the notes and outlines and maps flashing across its surface. She tried. It wasn’t long, however, until she could stand it no more and found herself wedged alongside the other children, eagerly scanning the horizon. Cerulean waves danced before her village, a mesmerizing rhythmic geometry tracing the fine border between sea and sky until blending into a medley of soft blues and misty haze. Beams of sunlight punctured the waves, columns of luminescence streaking defiantly into the depths below. Afton had lived her entire life on these waters. The ocean was their home, their power generator, their garden, and still it never ceased to steal her breath from her lungs. There was something her father would say whenever he caught her gazing upon the sea, that all the formulas and equations in the world wouldn’t mean a thing if they couldn’t simply appreciate the beauty of it. Harmony required more than mathematics. Illustration for XR Wordsmith's by Dustin Jacobus Living among the waves, carried by currents and the natural rhythms of the ocean alongside the fish and the dolphins, over forests of seaweed and metropolises of coral, their village was one with the watery world surrounding it. They had found their harmony, but very soon the entire village would get to experience this on an entirely new scale. The city was getting closer. It was hard to imagine that such place was still able to exist in perfect unison with its ecosystem. The city was just so big. Incredible as it was to believe, Afton heard that there were once cities even larger on the land, even if most people today lived on the water. Her ancestors lived in such a city, a long-lost place her grandparents called Jakarta, a name they only spoke of in the reverent whispers of a people eternally in mourning. It was one of many places reclaimed in the Great Flooding. That’s what her grandparents called it, although Afton never really understood the term. It didn’t sound so great. Entire countries disappeared into the ravenous sea, hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced by the rising ocean, the survivors moving onto the water as the remaining land dried up and was depleted. Afton read all about it. She was good at science. All the marine ecologists and engineers and meteorologists in her village said so. What didn’t make sense to Afton was how nobody noticed. Her grandmother said that people were aware the ice was melting but weren’t willing to do anything about it, neither to save the planet nor the people, but that made even less sense. When Afton looked down at her hands, she was surprised to see her scroll between her fingers. She glanced around, and slunk away into a corner as she opened it, eyes hungrily zipping from side to side. Her lips twitched as she read over the plan, little beads of sweat forming on her brow. She looked around again, ensuring that her father was not watching, could not witness her nervous recitations. Huddled against the wall, the scroll an inch from her nose, Afton read over it again, and again. “There it is!” Someone shouted. Eyes popping open wide, Afton felt her heartbeat jump and she rose on the tips of her toes to try and see between the crowds pointing and gasping, her small frame weaving between legs until she reached the railing. And there, crystalizing in the distance, magnificent structures began to take shape. The excitement was enough that even Afton’s great agenda and responsibilities vanished in her mind, the scroll returning hastily to her belt as eager eyes bulged with wonder. The village slowed as it navigated the maze of wind and tidal turbines heralding the appearance of the great city itself. Children on the floating village pointed upwards in awe at these awesome structures, children inhabiting apartments on top of the turbines laughing and waving giddily at the passing community. Their cheers joined with the clarion songs of seabirds plunging and diving, skimming the water’s surface, frolicking between roosts built into the slowly revolving edifices. “You know every one of these turbines provides the backbone for an entire ecosystem,” Afton informed a young boy who clung to the railings next to her, mouth agape. Afton tipped her head to glimpse a rainbow of brightly colored fish darting between the turbines. “There’s all sorts of reefs living down there.” With the village magnetically tethered, the villagers poured onto the dock amid gasps of wonder and the craning of necks. Afton swayed back and forth as she took it in, her body adjusting to its first time on a structure that didn’t rock with the waves, or at least rocked more subtly. Afton slowly took in the towering structures that composed the city, mouth hanging open. There was so much here that she wanted to see. The underwater greenhouses. The hatcheries. The reefs. The ocean, a wild garden that sustained the city. Her father also said that the capital had the most innovative waste reclamation system in the world, but Afton didn’t feel like she needed to see that in person. Of course, all of that would have to wait. Afton looked down at her hands, her throat going dry as she saw them trembling. She tried to retrieve her scroll, but for the first time her fingers seemed unable to reach it. The weight of it all seemed like an anchor on her shoulders, the reason her village had come to the city rising like floodwaters over her head. It was time to coordinate the rotations of fishing grounds, sustainability quotas, and the sharing of resources, but this year there was another issue at hand. A young girl from a small inconsequential village, just one in the vast Floating Republic, had discovered an unintended consequence of their fishing practices on the marine ecosystem. This research needed to be presented to the general assembly. Afton clenched her fists, trying to quiet her shaking fingers. The presentation seemed so daunting. The Floating Republic was so big, and she was so small. But her father always said that a utopia was not a place where things were perfect, only a place that was willing to address its own imperfections. And now she was part of that. “Avast! Be that the great savior of our rolling seas?” The Captain’s booming voice rattled Afton. She turned, clenching her teeth and trying to look brave. It was a great responsibility to be the captain’s daughter, and she wanted to be worthy of it. It was a great honor, to be heard by the assembly. It was a great privilege, to be a steward of the vast maritime garden they called their home. It was all so great, and in that moment she felt so small. The Captain leaned down in front of her and took her hands in one of his, smiling with large, sympathetic eyes. With his other hand, he slowly withdrew the scroll from her belt, and handed it to her. “Ready?” Afton took a deep breath, and nodded. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/08/12/global-newsletter-67/,"Rebels protest outside the local government in Goma city, Democratic Republic of Congo, to try and stop the auction of protected lands for oil drilling. In this issue: DRC Oil Auction | Maasai Evictions in Tanzania | Dernière Rénovation | Dear rebel, While the Global North struggles through an extreme summer of heatwaves, wildfires, and flash floods, people in the Global South are facing a fight for basic survival as their climates become less and less suitable for human habitation. Yet in Action Highlights we see how even those countries most threatened by global heating are abandoning climate pledges in the name of economic growth. Rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are scrambling to stop their government from auctioning off precious peatlands and nature reserves to oil companies. The DRC government's plans stem from, at best, a desire to alleviate national poverty, at worst, personal greed. But just like most other Global South countries, the DRC is held down by an ever-deepening debt spiral owed to the Global North - rich nations who themselves have a history of broken climate pledges and financial corruption. Trophy hunting and Safari tourism is fuelling the violent eviction of the Maasai from Tanzania. In our last issue, we reported on the Debt for Climate campaign that shone a light on the financial injustice that underpins what's happening today in places like the DRC. Find out about the next Debt for Climate campaign in Upcoming Actions. Our second story follows the indigenous Maasai people who are being evicted from their ancestral lands in the name of nature conservation. What is happening in Tanzania is an example of Fortress Conservation, and you can find out more about this grotesque and colonialist form of environmentalism, fueled by Safari tourism and greenwashing corporations, in Action Highlights. Dernière Rénovation activists are brutally arrested by police after blocking the Tour De France cycling race. Despite the summer getting tangibly hotter, most people in the Global North still have the luxury of ignoring the climate and ecological crisis - which is why eco-activists disturbing the peace in spectacular ways are so important. The new group Dernière Rénovation (Last Renovation) have been causing a stir in their native France and beyond with daring disruptions of major sporting events, and you can find out more about them in our Splinter of the Month section.

Rebels in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have mobilised to stop plans for new oil exploration in the country that risks destroying vital rainforests and peatlands. There have been marches through city streets, an outreach campaign targeting indigenous communities in affected villages, and a global awareness campaign using social media. The DRC government has opened up 27 oil blocks (vast portions of land) for auction, in the hope that international oil companies will buy the rights to explore and exploit them. But these blocks include the world’s largest region of peatland (making it one of the world’s most vital carbon sinks) as well as ancient rainforests and even parts of Virunga National Park, a Unesco World Heritage site. Rebels visit villagers in Ishasha to explain the harmful impacts of oil exploitation. Rebels from XR Université de Goma and XR Rutshuru have been visiting indigenous communities living on or around Virunga’s earmarked lands to inform them about the government plans, create ‘watchdog’ groups, and help mobilise peaceful resistance. The rebels believe that with enough community opposition, the government may be forced to change its plans. They are also using the meetings to discuss the racist legacy of ​​colonial conservation, also known as Fortress Conservation, where state officials see indigenous people as problems to be (often violently) dealt with, rather than expert custodians of their own land. Earlier the students of XR Université de Goma marched through the city to the regional government headquarters, telling the governorate of North Kivu province that the auction of oil blocks was suicidal and that the DRC should stick to the agreement it signed at COP26 to protect Conglolese rainforests. XRUK launches a solidarity protest outside the Congolese Embassy in London. As fossil fuel prices spike across the world, the DRC government says that revenue from the oil will help reduce poverty - saving the planet is not a priority. When the citizens of other oil-producing nations rarely see the spoils of such extraction, it is easy to remain cynical . But equally, how can countries in the Global North who grew rich drinking Africa’s oil now demand that the DRC forgo its future reserves to protect everyone else? The answer is that the country needs debt cancellation, and global support for a just transition, not another round of resource colonialism - which is what rebels and Congolese protesters called for outside the Congolese Embassy in London. Follow XR Université de Goma & XR Rutshuru and fund their campaign to protect Virunga National Park. A digital awareness campaign saw activists across the world use social media to protest the auction of Congo’s vast peatlands. Only the Amazon is a bigger carbon sink. JAN - AUG | Tanzania Maasai form a blockade in Ngorongoro to protect the land on which their culture and livelihoods depend. Since early 2022, the Maasai in northern Tanzania have intensified their fight against eviction from their ancestral lands in the Ngorongoro conservation area and Loliondo. The government wants to use the lands to make a safari park and expand trophy hunting opportunities, and have subjected the Maasai communities to waves of violence, exclusion, and evictions. Over the past months, XR Youth Solidarity and other rebel groups have organised joint international solidarity actions with the Maasai. In February, the Maasai organised a blockade at the entrance to the Ngorongoro Conservation Area. At the same time, rebels in London and Edinburgh protested outside the Tanzanian High Commission and several travel agencies who fuel the tourism that is driving the Maasai evictions. Rebels in Edinburgh (left) and London protest the Maasai evictions outside travel agencies that drive demand for tourism on Maasai land. Conservation projects often involve the violent theft of land from indigenous and other local communities, most of whom have lived in harmony with that land for milenia. It is known as Fortress Conservation, or colonial conservation, and the Environmental Justice Atlas currently records 141 cases worldwide. Fortress Conservation is accepted or even practised by many well known organisations, for example WWF, and is used by corporations to greenwash their extractivism. The Maasai and rebel groups have launched a boycott of companies that benefit from the practice and the tourism it fosters. 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity is on indigenous lands, and communities like the Massai want to lead our efforts to protect the planet and stop ecocide, not be displaced by them. In July, a delegation of indigenous East African people travelled to a major conservation conference in Rwanda and demanded an end to Fortress Conservation, and the beginning of indigenous led conservation without Western intervention.

Newsletter XTRA: A feast for the eyes and extra fuel for the soul! Newsletter XTRA An activist ties herself to the net during the French Open tennis tournament in Paris. Dernière Rénovation (Last Renovation) knows how to make people sit up and pay attention. Over the past two months, this new French eco-group has blocked Paris’ ring road, as well as France’s oldest highway, but most prominently, it has disrupted major sporting events. Millions of TV viewers watched a young activist tie herself to the net during the Men’s semi-final of the French Open tennis tournament. Millions more looked on as activists let off flares and blocked the route of the Tour de France cycling race on two occasions. During these actions, the activists wear white t-shirts with black numbers. This is a count down which started on March 28th when the group began their civil resistance, and marks the three years still remaining to avert the worse effects of the climate crisis. More arrests during another blockade of the Tour De France cycling race. Dernière Rénovation is part of the A22 network, which includes Letzte Generation in Germany, Fireproof Australia and Just stop Oil in the UK. Their strategy relies on quick actions, often implemented after one or two meetings, guided by one simple demand. Dernière Rénovation are demanding that the French government should immediately commit to comprehensive energy-efficient renovation of all buildings by 2040, with a financing system that covers the costs for the poorest home-owners. This demand was a key measure proposed by the French Citizens' Convention on Climate, a government initiated citizens’ assembly whose recommendations have still (and likely never will) be implemented. By winning a single, feasible demand, activists hope they can spark further civil resistance, changing the world one demand at a time. The well-aimed actions of Dernière Rénovation have triggered widespread national media coverage, as their website shows. The subsequent arrests and trials against those involved have made it harder for the government, and the French people, to ignore the climate crisis.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/08/10/hot-take-2-reparations-not-auctions/,"The Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) recent auction of licences to extract oil and gas in part of the Congo Basin rainforest - representing 5% of global tropical forests - should raise alarm bells across the world. The proposed drilling locations include parts of the Virunga National Park - a UNESCO World Heritage Site which hosts around ⅓ of the worlds mountain gorillas - as well as areas that host elephants, other great apes and myriad insects; not to mention tropical peatlands that contain the equivalent of three years’ worth of global emissions. Fossil fuel extraction in Africa has borne witness to untold human and ecological suffering: extraction in the Niger Delta, for example, has turned parts of the environment that used to hum with nature and brim with life-supporting rainforests and swamps into a post-apocalyptic wasteland, with the area losing 40% of its habitable terrain along with vegetation destruction and widespread water pollution, a loss which may now be repeated in the DRC. The DRC’s oil auction cuts right to the heart of the climate and ecological emergency and structural inequalities in North-South relations. Burning this oil will make our planet hotter. The trampling of the rainforest will deprive our Earth of another source of biodiversity. The draining of the peatland swamps will explode a carbon bomb in our atmosphere. Crucially, these effects will impact the Global South and marginalized communities globally the most. The DRC’s Hydrocarbons Minister Didier Budimba has explained the decision as a strategy to alleviate poverty for Congolese citizens, saying: “We have a primary responsibility towards Congolese taxpayers who, for the most part, live in conditions of extreme precariousness and poverty, and aspire to a socio-economic wellbeing that oil exploitation is likely to provide for them.” This rhetoric, though admirable, goes against analysis of the proposed plans by BankTrack who state that potential hydrocarbon pollution would affect the health and food security of up to 50,000 Congolese families who rely on the fishing resources of Lake Edward. More than this, renewed oil exploration in the DRC has been noted by some groups as a threat to stability in the vulnerable post-conflict country; while the threats and violence against environmental defenders by the state (sometimes in support of international energy giants!) - in the country ranked one of the deadliest in the world to be an environmentalist - shows that perhaps the human cost of exploration is greater than Mr. Budimba cares to admit. There is no doubt that the DRC is selling their oil because it is poor. But it was not always so. Belgium’s colonization and exploitation of the DRC was genocidal. While the Belgian King, Leopold II, gained some $1.1 billion from the DRC off work produced by enslaved Congolese people, it left the DRC one of the poorest nations in the world. Today nearly 75% of Congolese live on less than $1.90, while it owes over $6 billion in debt to international monetary groups, governments, and private companies. This socio-economic reality is consistent across the continent, and is compounded by the reality that more than half of African nations that export oil and gas rely on fossil fuel exports for more than 50% of their total export revenues. However, these export revenues are undercut and undermined by the fact that the majority of fossil fuel financing, exploration and project management comes from Global North corporations, meaning the majority of the profits flow out of Africa and into the pockets of the already-rich: a ""fossil fuel trap"". A quick dive into the ""top five leading oil and gas projects in Africa"" up to 2021 demonstrates how ‘host’ countries own very little (if any) of the infrastructure or commercial interests in new oil and gas explorations on the continent, with most done in ‘partnership’ with fossil fuel beasts from the Global North or investment arms of more powerful nation states. In fact, the global fossil capital network contains no African corporations or countries at all. Here are the five: i) Norwegian energy major Equinor and Shell - the latter responsible for disastrous oil spills in the Niger Delta - have generously given the Tanzanian government the “right to participate with a 10% interest” in the Tanzania Liquefied Natural Gas Project ii) The Rovuma LNG Project in Mozambique is a joint venture between climate deniers ExxonMobil, Italian fossil fuel company Eni, and the China National Petroleum Corporation. iii) Mozambique LNG is also funded by fellow climate-deniers Total - also responsible for the horrific East African Crude Oil Pipeline. iv) The ironically named ‘Gas Revolution Industrial Park’ in Nigeria has been developed by a consortium from South Korea, China and the United Arab Emirates; v) Also in Nigeria, the Zabazaba and the Etan fields are being developed by Nigerian Agip Exploration and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company, both of which are wholly owned and controlled by Eni and Shell respectively, who have a longstanding relationship as co-polluters and ecological destroyers in the country. The relationships listed above mark a continuation of what Jason Hickel terms ‘postcolonial plunder’ - the drain of $152 trillion from South - North since 1960 - and a continuation of imperial forms of unequal exchange and extractivism. Clearly Mr. Budimba is right to want to provide a better life for his fellow Congolese: they deserve full, happy and healthy lives; but getting into bed with big oil cannot be the answer. Ensuring a just transition across Africa will not be uniform or easy, yet over the last two decades only 2% of global investments in renewable energy were made in Africa, a continent which, according to CarbonTracker, has the potential to become a ‘renewables superpower’ accounting for 39% of total global clean-energy potential. However, whether or not such a transition will happen depends, in part, on a justice-led response from the wider international community. In 2009, the wealthiest nations promised $100 billion to poorer nations to help them adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis. That promise was broken. Meanwhile, the Global North continues to be responsible for 92% of excess emissions, while Nigeria and 47 sub-Saharan African countries - with 1/8th of the world's population - contribute less than 1% of excess emissions. The DRC offering further exploitation of its natural resources to the international community is not only environmentally disastrous, but is also symptomatic of the neocolonial shackling of poorer nations with international debt as ‘aid’ and ‘loans’. The forms of financial ‘assistance’ currently offered to many countries in the Global South consist of an unjust and dizzying monetary network in which lenders (institutes from the Global North) impose impossible debt upon the recipients (countries in the Global South), who are poorer to begin with- largely due to colonial exploitation by those same lending countries- and are then expected to repay these debts to lift themselves out of the poverty imposed on them in the first place by their creditors. Calls are rising up around the world for climate debt cancellation, led by people from most affected areas. These demands for climate reparations address the debt that is owed to the people of the Global South, who are (and will continue to be) most affected by a climate breakdown to which they have contributed the least. These may take many forms and may require a reframing of systems and a different understanding of ‘debt’, as well as targeted funding towards local organisations who understand the nuanced complexities of environmental issues on the ground, particularly in the context of corrupt institutions. The Global North has a moral (and perhaps legal) duty to cancel debt and heed the calls for climate reparations and climate justice to facilitate a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. Only then will poorer nations like the DRC not have to auction off precious biodiversity hotspots and carbon sinks. Only then can we begin to face the climate and ecological emergency together in a more just and equitable way. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/07/22/hot-take-1-feel-the-heat/,"""Climate change kills. It kills people, it kills our ecosystems, our biodiversity and destroys the things most precious to those affected."" Those were the words of Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, reacting to the worst summer of wildfires in the country for 15 years. The links between the accelerating climate and ecological emergency (CEE) to increasingly extreme weather events are well-known. The frequency of these events has increased dramatically over the last twenty years, the unmistakable connections between the human-induced climate catastrophe of continued rampant fossil fuel exploitation and use to extreme heat being the most well-established of all. Beyond Spain, the European heatwave has created and accelerated fires across France too, particularly in the south-west of the country where over 20,000 hectares of forest (about 50,000 acres) have burned, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. The heatwave is estimated to have claimed the lives of over 1,000 people in Portugal, with wildfires charring over 45,000 hectares (111,000 acres) of land along with ‘extreme drought’ being experienced by citizens. In the United Kingdom—which recorded July 19, 2022 as its highest ever temperature of 40.3°C (104.5°F)—firefighters battled wildfires across the country as the London Fire Brigade had its busiest day since World War Two, and hospitals were forced to turn patients away on account of the heat. Clearly, Europe is not alone in experiencing extreme heat. In January, a South American heatwave meant Buenos Aires recorded its second-highest temperature ever, with over 700,000 people losing power, while the extreme heat battered the regions’ crops and economy, as some politicians accelerate this destruction further. Heatwaves in India this March (which have since continued) saw temperatures consistently between 3-8 °C (37-46 °F) above average - the hottest since records began 122 years ago - with researchers finding the deadly heat, which also gripped neighbouring Pakistan, 30 times more likely on account of human-induced climate change. Following record-breaking heat in 2021 and subsequent wildfires that blew from coast-to-coast, 100 million US citizens are currently facing ‘excessive heat warnings’ or ‘heat advisories’; while China has experienced power shortages and crop failures as a result of extreme heat, with catastrophic heatwaves predicted over the coming weeks too. Photo: Pixabay Perhaps the most important and least-discussed fact during these heatwaves in the Global North is that of ‘heat-stress inequality’. This refers to the reality that both within and between countries, heatwave exposure over the last decade has been felt disproportionately by the lowest-income regions compared to highest-income areas. Much like the Covid-19 pandemic, while heatwaves may seem a phenomenon experienced equally by all, extreme weather events clarify deep-rooted structural inequalities which make the experiences of marginalised and vulnerable groups that much worse. Within countries, recent reporting has shown how China’s latest heatwave exposes growing ‘climate inequality’ as workers are forced to choose between personal safety and providing for their families while working in extreme conditions; while in India it is the poor who bear the brunt of searing heat. From a UK perspective, research co-authored by Friends of the Earth and the University of Manchester published in July of this year shows how the poorest communities and those from minority ethnic groups are most likely to live in areas at highest risk from heatwaves in the UK, despite having contributed the least to creating and accelerating the crisis, both historically and through lifestyle choices today. Between countries, global inequalities are stark, with one study demonstrating how countries ranked ‘low’ on the UN Development Programme’s ‘Human Development Index’ are expected to suffer greater exposure to heatwaves at 1.5 °C warming than populations living in countries ranked ‘high’ on the HDI scale at 2 °C of warming. This reality is made starker by a report, forecasting the displacement of over 1 billion climate refugees by 2050 from countries least well-equipped to combat and cope with the extreme weather events. The final nail in this coffin? The bleak realities of a multilateral system which ought to be ensuring historical reparations are paid to account for loss and damages experienced by countries on the frontline of the CEE; or that debts accrued by countries in the Global South owing to structural political-economic inequalities built into the international system are re-invested into ensuring a just transition globally, but which is failing to live up to the task and do either. Despite all of this, if you were to look at European mainstream media, taking the BBC in the UK as an example, the links between these rampant extremes and the structural causes of the CEE are not obvious at all. At the time of this writing, since publishing an article on the 29th March about the Meteorological Office’s dubious decision to ‘redefine’ what a heatwave means as the dial shifts ever-upwards, the BBC has published 194 items directly or indirectly related to the heatwaves scorching the UK. Yet a quick survey of these stories reveals that there are more items about keeping pets cool than about fossil capital driving the CEE and thus the heat we are experiencing! Depressingly, the BBC is one of the better UK media outlets in terms of actively publicizing the emergency to its readers and listeners, as Carbon Brief's excellent review of 'heatwave reportage' in the UK shows. As far as ‘telling the truth’ on heat is concerned—both in current political discourse and mainstream media coverage around the world—we still have a long way to go. As the temperatures continue to rise, we must also turn up the heat on complicit media and governments. While for some it may seem like a novelty, for others this heat has been a crippling reality for too long, and it will soon become our ‘new normal’ unless we tell the truth and act now. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

This issue: Debt 4 Climate | Brussels Rebellion | Ecuador Strikes x Scientist Rebellion | Dear rebel, A few weeks ago, high in the German mountains, the leaders of the world’s seven wealthiest democratic nations met in a luxurious castle for their annual summit. Last year, this Group of Seven (G7) pledged to transition to clean energy and help poorer countries in the Global South do the same. Their promises came to nothing. If anything, things are getting worse. The great injustice of the climate crisis - that those nations least to blame for global heating suffer its worst effects - continues. Debt 4 Climate Actions in (clockwise from top left) France, UK, Puerto Rico, DRC. A few months ago, a group of climate activists in the Global South noticed a strange financial paradox. Wealthy countries like the G7 are reluctant to pay their climate debts, yet poorer nations in the Global South are often lumbered with financial debts to those same countries. So why not cancel all debts? That way, the money liberated could be used by those poorer nations on climate action. The Debt for Climate campaign was born, and it was launched during this year’s G7 summit with actions in 24 countries around the world. Find out how rebels and activists from a range of movements united to amplify Debt for Climate’s brilliant central idea by heading to Action Highlights. There you will also find reports on how Scientist Rebellion have been supporting national strikes in Ecuador, and how rebels from across Europe descended on Brussels to demand an end to the ecocidal policies of the European Union. Rebels from across Europe united to blockade the EU Commission building in Brussels. Don’t miss this month’s Humans of XR, which features a wonderful young rebel who helped stop a new airport from destroying the only remaining old growth forest in Nepal.

Anything you can give is appreciated.* Support the Rebellion 26 - 28 JUNE | Worldwide While the world’s seven wealthiest economies convened at a luxury castle in the German Alps, the activists of the Debt for Climate campaign launched a global wave of protests. Their demand - that the G7 cancel all debts of Global South countries. Debt for Climate (D4C) was born only eight months ago in Argentina, blossoming from a broad coalition of Global South initiatives working to bring climate and social justice struggles together. Indigenous groups, rebels, Fridays for Future activists, labour unions and other social and environmental movements around the world united to highlight how the G7 keep Global South countries in a financial stranglehold so they can exploit them. Clockwise from top left: Trade Unions march with D4C in Argentina, speeches in Finland, huge anti-G7 & D4C marches in Germany, XR Muslims in Nigeria. At least 6,000 activists of this broad coalition marched through Munich in the run-up to the nearby summit, and thousands more trade unionists marched with D4C to Argentina’s IMF headquarters in Buenos Aires the next day. IMF headquarters also got a visit in Paris and Washington DC, with dozens of French activists managing to glue and lock themselves both inside and outside the institution. Meanwhile in Paraguay and Panama, indigenous protesters denounced climate debts and the deforestation of their lands. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Rwanda, rebels held signs and made videos calling on the G7 to cancel all debts, while Indonesian activists were expelled from the World Bank in Jakarta and forced to delete their footage from inside. From disruption in major capitals, to defiance in indigenous homelands, D4C actions were a truly global phenomenon, and you can find out more about all the action in this month’s Newsletter XTRA. Clockwise from top left: Romanian activists outside the IMF in Bucharest, XR Toluca in Mexico break an Earth pinata, indigenous protesters in Paraguay and Panama. The International Money Fund (IMF) and World Bank are run in a way that effectively gives the G7 nations controlling stakes. Their loans are offered to Global South countries, who are then encouraged to pay them off by allowing Global North corporations to exploit their resources. Trillions of dollars in debt payments have flowed from the Global South to the Global North since 1980, far more than the other way around. Worse, these debts often mean Global South countries greenlight destructive fossil fuel projects so that enough foreign currency can be generated to pay them back in time. If a country fails to meet its debt payments, harsh austerity measures are then forced on them, driving the debt and poverty downward spiral. Under such conditions, financing a transition to renewable energies is a distant dream. With their vast historical emissions, the G7 nations are chiefly responsible for today’s climate crisis, while Global South countries face its consequences in the form of floods, droughts and rising food insecurity. Over two days, D4C activists questioned exactly who owes who in this unjust arrangement. The speed and reach of their campaign shows that the time has come for a debt jubilee between the polluters and the punished. D4C is on Twitter and Instagram. Email info@debtforclimate.org to join the movement. 18 - 20 JUNE | Brussels, Belgium XR groups from across Europe joined forces in front of the European Union’s headquarters for a long weekend of rebellion. Their main demand was to make ecocide a criminal offence under EU law. The Brussels Rebellion culminated in 40 rebels blockading the European Commission building (where the EU executive meet), with some super-gluing themselves to the entrances. 20 were arrested by Belgian police but released soon after. The EU Parliament declared a climate emergency in 2019, yet the bloc still heavily subsidises fossil fuels, intensive animal agriculture, greenwash biofuels, and trawler fishing. Rebels from across Europe blockade the entrances to the European Commission. As well as demanding that EU law safeguard ecosystems from destruction, rebels demanded a shift to sustainable agriculture, the restoration of damaged ecosystems, and support for the incoming Debt for Climate campaign. In the lead up to the blockade, rebels, supportive NGOs, and frontline activists from Argentina and Colombia took part in a weekend program of speeches, workshops, and performances. Indigenous leaders from Brazil raised awareness about the EU’s anti-deforestation law and the need for it to include all biomes, not only the Amazon rainforest. Rebels stood with them in solidarity, which one attendee described as “incredibly moving.” Indigenous leaders call for the expansion of the EU anti-deforestation law while rebels show what’s still at stake. Rebels from France, Spain, Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, and more were united in Brussels. They hope that this European rebellion will inspire further collaborative rebel efforts in Belgium and beyond. A rebel present said, “Our movement needs to understand how powerful the European Union is and their impact, especially in terms of agriculture, climate legislation, subsidies… Everything is decided there. We need to show our presence more.” 13 - 30 JUNE | Quito, Ecuador Members of Scientist Rebellion Ecuador spent much of June providing food, shelter, and medical assistance to protestors from Indigenous groups who shut down the capital during a national strike. Tens of thousands of strikers resisted increases in food and fuel prices, and called for broader reforms which the repressive government eventually granted, including limitations to oil exploration and mining on indigenous lands. Rebels witnessed disproportionate force by police that resulted in five deaths and hundreds injured. Amnesty International said the state’s reaction was creating a human rights crisis. Concerned by how many protesters were sleeping in the streets, Scientist rebels began hosting them in Quito university and their own homes. The national strike lasted nearly 3 weeks and brought the capital to a virtual standstill. Scientist Rebellion spent over a thousand dollars on medical supplies for protesters (which at one point were nearly confiscated by police) then started purchasing helmets, gloves, and safety glasses after learning about the escalating casualties. “Our main goal was to save lives, because we were facing a fascist dictatorship during those 18 days. They only wanted to get power by force,” said one rebel. Days after the marching started, Ecuador’s President declared a state of emergency which criminalised public assembly and transit. Security forces also arrested the head of CONAIE, the indigenous rights organisation that called for the strike action. Amnesty International condemned the police response which saw five protesters killed and many hundreds more injured. CONAIE is no stranger to national shutdowns having led a similar strike in 2019 which caused the then administration to flee Quito. This time they issued ten demands to the government which included limits to oil exploration on indigenous land, a renegotiation of debts, and increasing health and education budgets. Initially, members of Scientist Rebellion were unsure about fully supporting the protest. Some of the demands, such as lowering the price of fuel and therefore bolstering fossil fuel subsidies, were not exactly consistent with addressing the climate crisis. Scientist Rebellion protest outside Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition in April. However, Ecuador is an oil producing country, and as one rebel explained: “it's disgusting to the common people that we should have to pay the international price for it.” “As scientists, we know that we need to reduce the subsidies. But, if the government doesn't provide alternatives, like sustainable public transportation, and you raise the price of fossil fuels; you won’t reduce the emissions, you will only increase the poverty of the people.” In April, Scientist Rebellion held a protest outside the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition to confront Ecuador’s inconsistent stance on subsidies. Rebels called out the government for greenwashing their position on climate change internationally, while planning to double the country’s oil production back home. 16 JUNE | Colombo, Sri Lanka Stop Adani protest is held outside the Indian High Commision. 18 JUNE | Krakow, Poland Polish rebels dressed as penguins participate in the 11th Critical Water Mass across the Vistula river, joined by an activist bear named Floe. The event draws attention to the global lack of access to drinking water and sanitation. 19 JUNE | Limbe, Cameroon Rebels celebrate Africa Liberation Week at the Favour Institute school with partners from Green and Better World. Their theme was Africa for Africans and for climate and environmental justice. 23 JUNE | San Francisco, USA Rebels dressed as ‘lamenters’ join a coalition of young activists to disrupt the California Air Resources Board (the agency in charge of keeping the state’s air clean). Eco-groups across California have condemned the agency’s plan for future climate policy, which doubles down on fossil fuel infrastructure and gambles on unproven carbon capture technology to save the day. Fossil fuel representatives were heard at the hearing, but many activists were not.

Newsletter XTRA A Tyre Extinguisher gets to work in the small hours of the night. As politicians procrastinate, our movement innovates. Since spring, a small but brave and growing group has been experimenting with a smooth new tactic to rid the world of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs). The idea is simple: insert a tiny object, like a lentil, into a car tyre’s valve-cap and that tyre will slowly deflate. It takes about ten seconds to complete the process, another five to slip a leaflet on the windscreen, and about an hour for the tyre to lose all its air. Why do this? Well, because SUVs are an enormous problem for all of us. They are the second biggest driver of the growth of global CO2 emissions; they massively increase the danger of our air and roads, with eight times the likelihood of killing children in collisions; and they starkly represent the unconscionable inequalities and excesses underpinning the ecological emergency. Since a UK-wide take-off in March, the Tyre Extinguishers (‘TX’) have quickly grown into an international phenomenon, with actions all over Western Europe, in New Zealand, and most recently sweeping the US. Their stated aim is to “to make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world’s urban areas”. TX has no formal relation to XR, and an XR UK statement helps clarify the differences of approach. But naturally there’s lots of common ground! We’ve heard several reports of XR local groups forming ‘spinoff’ TX teams, often with members looking for a way of taking direct action without much chance of arrest (so far, with well over 5,000 SUVs ‘disarmed’, there have been no arrests). Want to get involved? Just grab some friends, a leaflet and some lentils! Want to know more? Read this excellent Tyre Extinguishers profile.

Bidi marches with a coalition of activists through Kathmandu to save Nijgadh forest. I joined the fight to stop the Nijgadh International Airport Project in 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am now part of XR Youth Nepal, but this was the first time I had participated in such a movement. In lockdown in Kathmandu, I spent a lot of time reading about the proposed airport, which the government has been trying to develop in southern Nepal for several years. I realised I had to join the fight against these hugely damaging plans: it would mean the destruction of more than 2.4 million trees in the only remaining old growth forest in Nepal. Along with these ancient trees, many birds and plants would also be wiped out if the airport was allowed to go ahead. In May 2022 the Supreme Court ruled that the government cannot build there and should look for a different site, but the project has not been ruled out. So, we have won one fight, for now, but the forest is not safe. However, the legal team working to defend this precious area has been brilliant; they have given me hope and energy. The 2020 lockdowns meant I got involved with the movement online, and I joined regular webinars and social media groups. I helped build a coalition of climate and environmental groups to create ‘Rethink Nijgadh’, acting as a coordinator. I then joined up with the research and documentation team supporting the litigator in our case. I also contacted many journalists, though it has been difficult to get them to pay attention to our campaign. The elites and media insist that all economic development is good, so anyone opposing it is getting in the way of progress and prosperity. Since Nepal is so small, many people think it doesn’t matter what we do here – our impact on the climate will be tiny overall, so we don’t need to worry. I have certainly experienced periods of burnout, but I am committed to the fight to protect the climate and living world. Most people – including me – have to work and study, so we need to use the time and energy we have most effectively. Activism is not a trend; it is ongoing, and there is a long way to go. It is so important to find like-minded people in this struggle, and to keep supporting one another.

I like being a wolf because I have a lovely forest with Evergreen trees. Like Christmas trees. And it is very cold because I am in the Arctic. I like the Evergreen trees because they keep us healthy. Now that we’re not being hunted we get to run around and be more safe. The snow is thick and white and it feels rough. We get to play games. My best friend’s name is Alex and she is a penguin. We play tag together. Sometimes Alex wins and sometimes I win. One day me and Alex asked my dad if we could go to the North Pole and see if they have any kinds of trees like ours. He said yes, but we need a special airplane. But then when we were about to go we saw an ocean that had a whale and we asked if we could go on it to travel to the North Pole. So we traveled through stormy seas and huge whirlpools and we finally got to the land and we wanted to see some trees that looked like ours. But there was a snowstorm and it covered all the trees and it looked like a mountain of snow. We felt happy because we have all this thick white snow to make snow angels and snowballs. And then we found a map that showed us where to find the trees. We were in the wrong spot! The map told us to run from east to west and when we stopped we started digging and finally found the trees and then we told all the animals in the Arctic to come to the North Pole riding six whales from the ocean. Then all the kids played and the grown ups talked together and then had a party. There was a lot of cookies and cupcakes and mince pies. There was music and balloons with confetti. There were a lot of grey clouds filled with snow. We all felt excited because we were going to play musical chairs with 94 chairs. Because there were 95 animals. The End.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Illustration by Hal HefnerI’m Dylan, the greatest inventor of all time. One of my greatest Inventions is a giant water-powered air conditioner with a global warming detector, I named it- Dylan Cooler! So why did I invent this machine? I genuinely love animals, especially polar bears. They live in the North Pole where there is a lot of ice. They need this ice to feed, rest and raise families. However the ice is melting because of global warming. People use cars, planes and factories which create a lot of extra CO2. On top of that, people eat a lot of beef which requires farmers to raise cows. These cows release methane gas when they eat. Too much CO2 and methane in the air acts like a blanket and traps the heat, making the earth hotter, which melts the ice in the North Pole. It breaks my heart to see the polar bears suffer when too much ice has melted and they have no choice but to keep swimming, because they have no place to rest. So what could we do to help them? I couldn’t ask everyone to stop driving or flying and to stop eating beef. I couldn’t ask factories to close because we still need their products. So that’s why I invented this giant air conditioner. The Dylan Cooler gets its power from an underwater turbine powered by sea currents. I put it in the Arctic. Global warming causes temperatures to rise which melts the ice which makes the sea level rise. The detector will notice the sea level rising which means that the temperatures are going up. The Dylan Cooler will then turn on automatically so more of the water will be frozen into ice, giving polar bears more places to live. When temperatures are back to normal, the Dylan Cooler will turn off. So what’s next for me? I chose to help the polar bears in the North Pole first, because the ice in the Arctic is melting faster than the ice in Antarctica, and the reason is that the Arctic is in the middle of the ocean, so the ice can float around. Eventually, the ice will float to a place where the water is warmer, which will cause the ice to melt. On the other hand, what makes the Antarctica melt slower is that the Antarctica is surrounded by a bunch of islands, so the ice won’t float to places that have warmer water. In fact, the ice will stack on each other sometimes, so the ice will be thicker. Even so, the penguins in the South Pole seem to have similar problems as the polar bears did . They also need ice to rest, feed and raise families, Global warming is causing their ice to melt as well. So that’s why my next step is to help the penguins I am going to send another Dylan Cooler to Antarctica ! In the future, the polar bears and penguins will live happily ever after, and all because of me. That’s all folks! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Nowadays, students do not enjoy school much because it is boring. So a lot of teachers are determined to make the school a fun place, while keeping it safe and eco-friendly. But how? We’ll find out! Outside there will be an invisible protection zone, when you want to go to the school there will be fingerprint recognition to check if it is you, also there will be a hand sanitizer inside. Most people like it when pets play around them. Students always hope that they can bring their pets to school because they feel sad to say goodbye to their pets every day when they have to go to school. And now, students can bring pets to school, and get them back after school, and also they can play with them during break time. Pets can be sent to the pet school, there will be a lot of trainers and they can train them to sit or lay and even teach them to become friends with other animals! There are a lot more. Pet school provides water, treats, baths, and beds for them to sleep. When they have to pee or poop, there will be a paper pad for them. When they want to play, they can play with one another. Now we have to go to the classroom, there is a teleportation stand next to the entrance for each class, you just have to stand on your class teleportation stand, and you will arrive at the classroom in a second! But it tickles when you teleport and you feel like you are yanked up, if you move, it won’t work. So a lot of people failed to make it to the classroom on time. Illustration by Hal Hefner In the center of the classroom, desks are floating. The biggest one is the teacher’s desk, the other floating desks are for the students. On the teacher’s desk, there is a small pen, it allows you to write in the air! The student’s desk has an accelerator and a brake so it looks and works like an automobile so you can play with it during the break. And students don’t need to have homework, because they do all the work on their 3D projector. It explains how to do all the homework, so if you don’t understand something, you can always ask it for some guidance to finish the workbook at school. In our school, there will be a lot of paper savings. For the paper-saving part, we will try to use as much technology as possible, now we use paper to write our homework, but in my school, they will use iPads instead of paper so we won’t have to worry about wasting too much paper. Now is time for lunch! Welcome to the cafeteria. You don’t see anything except a robot in the center only, it cooks everything! Including BBQ and peanut butter sandwiches, pasta, boiled vegetables, etc… They are all cruelty-free. There are some microphones, you order through them. After you eat, the robot will clean your plates and silverware without wasting too much water. Cool, right? Well, I think so. Next is Physical Education time! The gym has an underwater racing track, you and your friends can race with mini underwater motorcycles. There is also a climbing wall, and a trampoline basketball court! If people get hungry or thirsty during PE class, packets of water and fruit will be served. There is a proper pool for you to swim in, it has a place to log your body condition, so it can recommend you an appropriate workout to make sure that you won’t get hurt in the pool. It also has a towel generator to supply you with towels, and also a toy generator for you to play on the water. In one semester, there will be one or two classes to let kids who are not disabled go around in a wheelchair to let them experience and respect disabled kids. Ringggggg!!!!! It is break time! Ya~ The first thing you see is the zipline, there is a house like a cart, it can hold two people, there are two chairs nailed to the ground, and a table, you can admire the scenes or read your book, I promise you will find your own fun there! Next, there is a horse riding area. The horses are mechanical but look real, except that they have lines that glow whatever color you want! There is a skydiving place, you have to take an elevator to the top and there are robots to help you wear the equipment and a parachute, and then you are ready to go! There is a drifting river you can float on, etc…….. Next is nature class! In nature class, you will learn to grow plants and food in a garden. And we will avoid eating meat because killing animals will stop the circle of life. And one day, pigs, chickens, cows, ducks, etc will go into extinction. And there will be no more animals. We will also save water, when it is time to go home the teachers will go around the classroom asking if any students have any water left in their water bottles then the teachers will take the water to the garden and pour it in the dirt where the food grows to water it, we are doing that to replace all the water that you use to water a garden. And we will have a class or two about the importance of saving water and paper. And paper comes from trees, and trees help make the air fresher. So to save trees, you can start a petition about saving trees, and get people to sign it. And turn it into the government. Next up is cooking class. These days, a lot of people think that cooking is the girl’s job, but the men also need to learn how to cook because if they are single and not so rich, they have to cook for themselves. They will also use the vegetables and herbs to make delicious dishes! This helps them sort of prepare for their future. Everyone loves field trips! So the field trips will continue but the bus is made of glass and it can go on and under the water, fly, and go into space and even land on other planets! Of course, it can drive on land! It looks like a whale shark when it is underwater, isn’t it cool? It looks like a bird when it flies! No one is driving the bus, instead, a robot controls it by using the steering wheel. When it’s in the air it uses wind power, when it’s underwater, it uses water power! Cool, right? So that is the future school of my design! If I can rate this school, I will give it 100! share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/06/27/woman-equal-rights-climate-change/,"To mitigate against the worst impacts of climate change, we urgently need to eliminate discriminatory laws and cultural practices that curtail women's inheritance and property rights. Preventing women from owning land and other assets leaves them more vulnerable to climate shocks, and this has a damaging ripple effect with ramifications for us all. Esta is a member of the Maasai tribe and lives in rural Tanzania. She was prohibited from going to school, instead sent to tend cattle in dangerous conditions and at age 12 was married to a 40-year-old man. She tells us: ""In the Maasai, there is no decision making for girls and women, if your father or husband decides if it is good or bad you must accept it, you have no voice"". Image by Tara Carey. UN figures indicate that 80% of those displaced by climate change are women, and this is underpinned by the ways in which women are denied equal ownership, use, and control over land. Globally, over 400 million women work in agriculture, producing the majority of the world's food, and in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, women account for between 60% to 80% of the agricultural workforce. And yet, women own less than 20% of the world's land, and female farmers lack equal rights to own land in over 90 countries. Possessing land enables wealth creation and provides social and economic stability. Particularly in the Global South, where subsistence farming is a vital source of food and income, access to land is an important part of survival, status and sustainable development. On the flip side, being landless makes it harder for women to access credit and is among the best predictors of poverty. A 2020 report by Equality Now examining laws that discriminate on the grounds of sex, cited data showing that close to 40% of countries had at least one constraint on women’s property rights. In 36 of 189 countries, widows were not granted the same inheritance rights as widowers, and 39 countries prevented daughters from inheriting the same proportion of assets as sons. In many places, laws that deprive women of their ownership rights stem from gender-discriminatory religious and cultural practices, which are expressed through family laws that govern intimate aspects of our lives, including marriage, divorce, and inheritance. This occurs in Muslim countries with personal status codes that are influenced by Shariah law stipulating how wives and daughters are not entitled to parity in inheritance and are allowed only half of what a male counterpart would obtain. Widowed women are particularly exposed to laws and harmful cultural practices that block their access to inheritance. This can result in them being allocated just a fragment of their spouse's wealth, or being forced from their homes and land, leading to destitution. According to the UN, nearly one in ten widows worldwide lives in extreme poverty, and this includes those widowed due to climate-related disasters. Without legal protections and access to justice, a widow’s ability to secure property rights depends largely on the strength of her relationship with her husband’s family, and the norms within their community. Resolution of disputes often comes down to family mediation, and due to social stigma and cost, it can be rare for women to contest inheritance claims. Attempts to remove unequal inheritance laws are routinely and forcefully rebuffed on the grounds that reforms contradict religious doctrine, threaten cultural identity, and would destabilize the family unit and wider society. Indeed, such arguments provide an example of how family laws that defer to religion and culture have been amongst the most entrenched and resistant to improvement. Denying women equal inheritance undermines their decision-making power, economic independence, and monetary prospects, and increases their exposure to homelessness, exploitation, and gender-based violence. All of this renders them more vulnerable to climate change and makes it tougher to recover from climate-related losses and resource conflict. Hazards stemming from global rising temperatures such as severe drought and floods disproportionately harm women and girls in numerous ways, especially in the Global South, which is experiencing some of the most extreme weather. Research has found that women are up to 14 times more likely to die or be injured during a climate-related disaster, and in the aftermath, rates of sexual and domestic violence, human trafficking, and maternal mortality surge. And for those displaced, access to health services including sexual and reproductive healthcare, is generally difficult or impossible. Facing all this without an effective social or fiscal safety net can be dire. Economic hardship arising from climate crisis and forced migration pushes people further into poverty. This disproportionately impacts girls, who are more frequently withdrawn from school in order to work or be married off, with parents viewing marriage as a coping mechanism to elevate financial strain and shield daughters from sexual violence. Another way that climate upheaval burdens women and girls is by making it harder to gather and produce food, collect water, and source fuel for cooking and heating, which in many communities are deemed female responsibilities. Traveling further to acquire scarce resources takes up precious time that could be spent on productive activities such as education or income-generation. This extended travel time also heightens the risk of sexual violence. A study on Sudan’s West Darfur found that 82% of rape cases treated in clinics occurred while women were doing daily tasks such as collecting water and firewood, and almost a third (28%) of victims reported being raped multiple times. Many women in Naivasha, Kenya work on flower farms, producing blooms sold around the world. These women face sexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse which is getting worse as the climate crisis forces more women to leave land and head to Naivasha for work, increasing competition for jobs and increasing women workers' vulnerability. Image by Tara Carey As primary users of natural resources and as the ones statistically most harmed by climate breakdown, women have a pivotal part to play in environmental management and decision-making. And yet, they are routinely excluded or marginalized. Gender equality goals must be at the heart of environmental governance. Especially at the local level, women have been working hard to develop coping strategies and address climate-related challenges. They are highly resourceful innovators who possess the knowledge and expertise needed for successful climate mitigation. To rectify shortcomings in family law, feminist organizations from around the world have come together to launch the Global Campaign for Equality in Family Law, which calls on governments to ensure equality for all women and men under the law in all matters relating to the family, regardless of religion, culture and tradition. International Development Law Organization (IDLO) in their 2022 report on achieving climate justice, gave “enhancing women’s rights to land and other natural resources” as one of three key elements, alongside “empowering women and girls to claim their environmental rights and actively participate in decision-making processes” and “strengthening regulatory frameworks and institutional capacity for feminist climate action.” Securing these reforms would help women break the cycle of poverty, benefiting them, their families, and wider society - including yielding greater protection for ecosystems. For example, research demonstrates that women’s participation in natural resource management is associated with better resource governance and conservation. The High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development provides an annual opportunity for the United Nations to review commitments and progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In 2022, goal 5 on gender equality and goal 15 on life on land have been selected to be assessed in-depth - recognition by the international community that both are integral to sustainable development. Lamentably, while gender equality is enshrined in the constitutions of most countries, commitments are not always translated into legal and policy frameworks and even when laws are equitable, deep-rooted patriarchal social norms commonly lead to weak implementation. It is vital that laws and policies address women’s distinct requirements, vulnerabilities, and contributions as agents of change. Unless women are guaranteed equal rights under the law - in all spheres of life - and are empowered as equal participants in decision-making, government actions will perpetuate existing gender inequalities and hamper women’s ability to adapt to our changing climate.This guest blog was written by Roya Rahmani, former Ambassador of Afghanistan to the United States and Global Strategist at Equality Now. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

Other activists targeted the banks and institutions that finance Total’s climate destruction. 17 MAY | Paris, France: Eight days earlier, climate protestors disrupted the annual general meeting of BNP Paribas. The ninth largest banking conglomerate in the world, BNP Paribas is Total’s second largest banker. 24 MAY | London, UK: More than 80 rebels and other activists disrupted Shell’s first annual general meeting in the UK. A flash mob upstaged the Shell Chairman’s address, singing “We will, we will stop you” to the tune of ‘We Will Rock You’. Others glued themselves to chairs and interrupted speeches, with protestors from Nigeria, the Netherlands and the UK reading out testimonies accusing Shell of human rights abuses, ecocide, fueling climate breakdown and funding misinformation. The day before, Shell’s senior safety consultant dramatically quit over the firm’s “double talk”. She sent her resignation video to more than a thousand colleagues explaining why, and asked them to “please walk away while there’s still time”. 18 MAY | Winnipeg, Canada: Activists chained themselves outside the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) to protest the Coastal GasLink pipeline being built through the indigenous Wet’suwet’en territory in British Columbia. RBC has put $262 billion into fossil fuel projects since 2015, including a $6.8 billion loan for the Coastal GasLink. The Wet’suwet’en Nation has condemned escalating police harassment. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recently issued its third rebuke to Canada and British Columbia, calling for withdrawal of police and an end to the forced eviction of Wet’suwet’en people from their territory. 12 MAY | Seoul, South Korea: In March last year, six rebels occupied a political party HQ for its support of a new airport. Instead of paying the fines issued, the rebels decided to go to trial, XR Korea’s first.

In this issue: Denmark’s Turning Point | Finland’s Overconsumption Uprising | Sweden’s Fossil Rebellion | Netherland’s Rebellion Against the Fossil Fuel Industry | Sri Lanka’s Crisis Dear rebel, ​​After nearly a decade in power, Australia’s coal-loving, climate-denying government has finally been replaced by a party pledging to make the country a renewable energy superpower. Without the tireless actions of XR Australia and other eco-groups, this growth in voter climate-consciousness might never have happened. But while a mighty battle has been won, the region’s climate wars continue. The new government has already greenlit a gigantic gas project, showing that it’s no real threat to the fossil fuel industry. Luckily our movement is made of sterner stuff. Dutch rebels march through Rotterdam. Their banner: ‘Stop The Fossil Industry’. Photo: Pierre Larrieu, Hans Lucas In Action Highlights we report on fossil fuel focused rebellions in Finland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. In each, rebels launched sustained actions that disrupted fossil fuel facilities, highlighted fossil fuel subsidies, and pushed for an immediate switch to renewable energies. We also have a special report from Sri Lanka, which is being rocked by price shocks, power cuts, mass protest, and outright political turmoil.

Support the Rebellion 6 - 13 MAY | Copenhagen, Denmark Oil Slicks from Gothenburg joined the rebellion in Copenhagen. Photo: Jorn Zoega XR Denmark wanted to inspire a turning point in their government’s attitude to the climate crisis, and organised a packed week of rebellion in their capital to do it. 240 rebels were arrested over the campaign, and it became the country’s biggest climate protest since COP15. The action started in style, with hundreds of rebels surrounding the island on which the Danish Parliament building stands. All nine bridges to the island were blockaded, and became sites for speeches, music, and artworks expressing rebel despair over Denmark’s stagnant climate politics. More than 130 people were arrested on the day, including a celebrated Danish author, and the action ended up attracting a lot of media attention. Left: A march for climate refugees. The banner reads: ‘Inclusive Climate Policies Now!’ Photo: Jorn Zoega. Right: Music during Parliament’s blockade. Photo: unwisemonkeys. The next day, rebels marched through the city to demand justice for climate refugees around the world, and for Danish politicians to take responsibility for those people already displaced by their inaction on carbon emissions. Rebels also targeted Copenhagen Airport, where plans to build a new airstrip will destroy the surrounding natural area. While some activists blockaded the departure hall, others walked right out onto the tarmac. During the final days of the rebellion, Copenhagen hosted climate ministers and other representatives from nearly 50 countries for a special pre-meeting of COP27. Danish rebels seized the chance to end their week as boldly as it began. Rebels block the departure hall of Copenhagen Airport. Photo: Klaus Henrik Andreasen In the morning, rebels blockaded key roads so that the arriving officials were forced to walk through the protest. Gabon’s Foreign Minister stopped to speak with the rebels, and later two rebels were invited inside to talk to the Egyptian Foreign Minister (the nation hosting COP27 in November). But real change must come from below, which is why XR Denmark also organised a workshop on citizens’ assemblies led by specialist researchers in the field. Rebels called on their government to update Danish democracy with a legally binding Citizens Assembly on climate policy. 6 - 21 MAY | Finland Rebels block the security gates of Helsinki Airport. Terminal T2 of Helsinki Airport experienced some technical issues last month. Namely 60 rebels blocking its entrance and 30 more protesting outside the building. Elokapina (XR Finland) staged the protest against the country’s largest airline Finnair, whose HQ is in the airport, and their government, who are majority-owners. Rebels demanded that the state reduce air travel to a sustainable level. The state reacted by taking 28 of them ​​​​​into police custody. Elokapina activists lock-on to train tracks leading to the Neste oil refinery. The action was part of the Overconsumption Uprising, a campaign which had kicked off the day before with a 400-person roadblock in the busiest part of Helsinki. There, Global South collective Somos Sur gave a rousing speech about the importance of decolonization to the climate protest movement. The Overconsumption Uprising made two demands of the government. First, that it include consumption-based emissions in its climate goals (ie. count the carbon footprint of goods used by consumers in Finland but not actually manufactured there). Second, that it reduce national resource and energy use to sustainable levels. This year, Finland’s Overshoot Day (the day resource and energy demands would exceed sustainable limits if the whole world mirrored that nation) was March 31st. To close the Overconsumption Uprising shopping centres in 10 Finnish cities saw actions like this one in Tampere. The fast-fashion garland echoes a local fresco. The two weeks of rebellion included more than 10 actions, with highlights including a guerrilla gardening team transforming a Helsinki tram stop into a pollinator oasis, and the brave blockade of the state-owned Neste oil refinery that continues to process Russian fossil fuels. The uprising ended with a wave of anti-consumerist actions in shopping centres across the land. Elokapina thanked their rebels for a great campaign, and are already preparing for the next one - the Utopia Rebellion in June! 25 - 29 APRIL | Stockholm, Sweden Hundreds of Swedish rebels swarmed their capital for five fabulous days of disobedience, the longest campaign in XR Sweden’s history. The Fossil Rebellion saw protests pop up in Stockholm’s streets, Parliament, airport, health authority, and Russian Embassy. In the process around 130 rebels were charged with offences, and the city’s police force came close to being overwhelmed. The rebellion’s main demand was an end to fossil fuel subsidies. The Swedish government gives the fossil fuel industry and other climate-damaging industries over $3 billion each year. Meanwhile it spends less than half of that on environmental budgets. Rebels occupy Stockholm’s busiest junction, XR medics sit inside their national health agency (sign: Climate Crisis = Health Crisis), rebels blockade Bromma Airport, Red Rebels mourn outside it. The week of action started with traffic blockades in the city centre. 150 rebels set up camp in Stockholm’s busiest junction, and used glue, tripods, and a sparkling pink boat to hold it for three hours. A jazz band played as police carried the rebels away. The short-sightedness of Sweden’s politicians was highlighted by a mass die-in outside Parliament. A small group of rebels entered the building and shouted at the politicians from the public gallery before being dragged away by security. The next day rebels returned to Bromma Airport (following up on an amazing nationwide anti-aviation campaign back in February) to drop banners from its roof, blockade its security gates, and rally in its departure lounge. A small group tried to make it to the runway but were intercepted by police. Stockholm’s police required regional reinforcements to cope with the sustained action. A group of rebel psychologists and health professionals staged a sit-in at the National Board of Health and Welfare. The government agency is meant to safeguard the nation’s health, but doesn’t recognise the climate crisis as a health crisis. With extreme weather causing five million deaths globally every year, and climate anxiety in young people skyrocketing, rebels told the agency to wake up and take the issue seriously. Finally, to highlight how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was funded by fossil fuel exports (mainly to EU countries like Sweden), rebels converged on the Russian Embassy to sing songs and put on a protest performance. An anti-war song by a Soviet dissident was included to show solidarity with those brave Russians standing up to their own government. 19 - 24 MAY | Rotterdam, The Netherlands The city of Rotterdam is home to Europe’s largest petrol and coal port, making it the perfect setting for a week of actions targeting the fossil fuel industry. The Rebellion Against the Fossil Fuel Industry started with a big procession through the city that combined marching with lots of artivism, music, and speeches. Rebels were up bright and early the next morning to blockade the local BP refinery, and occupy roads to ExxonMobil facilities as well as the head office of dredging company Boskalis, whose exploits recently devastated Indonesian fisherfolk. Left: The opening march. Right: The BP Refinery blockade. Photos: Steffie Emmerson Dutch activists also staged a demo outside SBM Offshore, an oil and gas platform builder, and orchestrated a massive banner drop from a Shell oil tanker. Over the weekend there was a regenerative community programme to help rebels recharge and reconnect between the action days. Workshops and talks about regenerative cultures and climate justice were mixed with more practical sessions, like how to make seed-bombs. Rebels block the Onyx railroad. The banner: ‘No future in fossils’. Photo: Paul Buckley The final day of the rebellion happened to be the biggest, with more than 350 rebels involved in blockades across the port and central Rotterdam. In the port, rebels chained themselves to both the railroad and main conveyor belt of the Onyx coal plant. Meanwhile in the city, rebels targeted Shell’s Dutch HQ as they blocked a major thoroughfare. 175 rebels were arrested on the day, but none were held overnight. The rebellion was a great success for XR Netherlands, with the actions receiving widespread media coverage that made the movement much more visible nationwide. Videos of the major actions can be seen here. APRIL/MAY | Sri Lanka Protesters march through Colombo demanding their president resign. Photo: EPA The people of Sri Lanka are suffering. A perfect storm of bad governance, global price rises, and Covid-depleted tourism has caused a major economic crash, severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, and mass protest across the country. Members of XR Sri Lanka have been a part of these peaceful protests, whose main demand is the removal of the country’s corrupt President. But the rebels are also trying to highlight how this economic crisis is connected to the climate crisis. Despite having sunshine all year round, Sri Lanka has failed to transition to renewables and remained dependent on imported fossil fuels. The war in Ukraine and the rising oil price was the final nail in the coffin for the country’s import-heavy, debt-ridden economy. ‘GotaGoGama’ protest camp in Colombo where rebels co-run an environmental stall. This economic crisis has always been deadly, with reports of elderly people dying as they queued for essentials. But in April the protests started turning violent. Police shot into crowds, and pro-government mobs beat protestors and burnt their tents as the police looked on. Activists have been killed, paralyzed, and severely injured. Since 2019, XR Sri Lanka has been highlighting their government’s numerous eco-crimes, including wanton deforestation and mineral mining with no regard for the environmental impacts. But direct action has long been difficult in a country whose repressive political atmosphere has only worsened over recent months. One rebel was arrested with friends during a peaceful demonstration outside Parliament, and only released when a large group of lawyers came to their rescue. Activists paint an ecocide-themed mural at the ‘GotaGoGama’ protest camp. Awareness of climate issues is very low in Sri Lanka. With basic survival still the priority for many, now is a difficult time to spread the word. Nonetheless, at GotaGoGama, a major protest camp in a park in Colombo, there is an environmental stall co-run by rebels, with programs about the environment, biodiversity and climate change available to those who are interested.

Previously a no-go area for development, the area’s thick forests sustain livelihoods and a huge amount of wildlife, but are now being cleared for the mines. 25 MAY | Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo: On Africa Day, activists raised the alarm about French oil giant Total and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation’s imminent construction of the East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline. EACOP will run through the heart of Africa, displacing communities, endangering wildlife and tipping the world that much closer to full-blown climate catastrophe.

The EU has to criminalise ecocide and save our forests, oceans and soils. Rebels from all over Europe are coming together. Indigenous leaders from Brazil will join us to stand up against the destruction of our ecosystems. In 2019 the European Parliament declared the climate emergency, but since then the EU has continued with deadly politics. We need fair policies that are decided by the people, not by corporations and their well-paid lobbyists. Together we are powerful. Together we're unstoppable. Join us in Brussels! 26 - 28 JUNE | Global We will bring together workers unions and social movements of the Global South to show how social justice and climate justice can be delivered hand in hand. We are a global team planning to pressure wealthy countries into paying their Debt For Climate. How do they do this? By renegotiating the financial debts that burden Global South countries, so the money can be spent on a just transition. With the stroke of a pen, we can keep trillions of dollars worth of fossil fuels in the ground and free impoverished nations from debt. We must take to the streets all over the world and build the necessary pressure to bring it about. We are calling for the first global mobilisation to happen during the G7 summit in June. The world's 7 most powerful economies control the IMF and the World Bank, and have the power to change the policies of international lending bodies.

These stories offer a vision of what the future could be, not what it will be, and include beautiful original artwork. Gary Snyder’s 1990 book of interrelated essays does not directly mention climate change, yet every page bears upon the crisis and its possible solutions. The book is a meditation on the meaning of wildness in the world and in ourselves. To defend the planet, he suggests, requires defending something vital in ourselves and each other—and vice versa. Too many environmentalists see “nature” as a human-free zone. Snyder avoids that racist and ahistorical framing and instead posits wildness as a community that naturally includes humans. He grounds his vision not only in the European-American cultural lineage he was raised in but also in Chinese, Japanese, and Indigenous American cultures—and he does so in a way that feels humble and genuine, not fetishistic. Snyder vows to fight what he calls the “Growth-Monster” through a personal practice that includes honest, loving, kind participation in that wider, wild community. Extinction Rebellion seems an example of exactly what he was talking about. Here are a few other books recommended by our team and our readers… We Thought It Was Oil--But It Was Blood: Poems, by Nnimmo Bassey Nnimmo Bassey is one of many poets from the Niger Delta, a region devastated by the oil industry, who has used poetry to fight colonialism and extractivism. This collection is a call to action from a celebrated activist on the frontline of the climate crisis. To Cook a Continent: Destructive Extraction and the Climate Crisis in Africa, by Nnimmo Bassey As Nnimmo Bassey says, the Global North likes talking about what to do for Africa, but not what it has done to Africa—and what Africans can do about it. Here Bassey gives a thorough and eloquent historical overview of the exploitation of the continent. Avoid Amazon.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/06/08/relationships-climate-crisis-anxiety-alienation/,"All original illustrations painted in watercolour for XR Global by Dustin Jacobus This is not an article about the phenomenon of eco-anxiety. Reams have already been written about ecological anxiety, including XR’s Special Report: A Short Guide To Eco-anxiety. Thankfully, this response to the climate and ecological crisis is increasingly accepted by professionals to be quite understandable from those of us focused on the perilous state of our planet… or anybody who’s paying even the slightest attention to the news. This article is about why some of your loved ones are struggling to support your eco-anxiety. I am an anxious person. I didn’t tell anybody I was gay until I was 17, which taught me that I either talk about what’s on my mind with the people I love, or my day-to-day life becomes difficult. Of course, gay men approach their sexuality and life decisions in a myriad of ways, but for me, repression from expression lead to depression. The climate and ecological crisis smashes around inside my head like rocks in a washing machine. I’ll see a bird and think about how few there are compared to 50 years ago. Or, while I compost my food waste, I wonder about people I know who have the facts and tools to also do this, but don’t. These thoughts build in my head like drips in a bathtub, trickling until the tub overflows. When I express these thoughts, the plug is lifted for a few seconds and I no longer feel overwhelmed. When I hit general anxiety overflow, my family and friends usually help me to express myself, and I feel better. When it comes to eco-anxiety, however, my experience is often different. You might recognise some of the responses I have received: These responses do not help me. I don’t want to calm down. I don’t want to be numb to the climate crisis, or learn to put it in a box. What I want is to do something about it. I had four sessions with a therapist, who told me that my eco-anxiety is rational. I knew that already. I feel adrift and alienated in my feelings for an issue that does not warrant alienation. I began to wonder: how many other people feel this way? There must be loads of us. I first realised I was indeed not alone while watching a debate regarding the Insulate Britain protest group on Good Morning Britain, featuring journalist and environmentalist George Monbiot. The part that struck me was presenter Susanna Reid’s comments to Monbiot at around nine minutes in, a couple of minutes after he had teared up, as he described potential climate scenarios. Reid’s response? ""George, I’m sorry that you feel tearful about it. You obviously feel something that is not getting across to that majority of people."" So, as Monbiot is having a rational reaction to the widely verified fact that humanity is knowingly creating the end of our civilization, the presenter is simply sorry that he’s crying about it. Bingo! That’s how I feel: alienated. This article is not about who is right and who is wrong. There are more than enough polarizing thought pieces on the internet already, and I refuse to add fuel to that smouldering heap. Rather, it’s about how to appreciate and handle feelings of alienation that may arise when you need to express eco-anxiety. I contacted the Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA) for help. This alliance brings together psychologists who are engaging with the climate crisis, including Linda Aspey. A coach, facilitator, therapist, and speaker, Aspey told me that I’m not alone in feeling alienated. Aspey described a scene that will be familiar to many of us: watching footage of people starving to death in a famine-hit country on the 6 o’clock news while eating dinner in a safe and comfortable home. Aspey rightly points out that, in order for humans to be able to function on a daily basis, we have developed all sorts of coping processes for such scenarios — processes that can be applied to the climate and ecological crisis, as well. They include: The distance could be literal or metaphorical, but by establishing it, we make ourselves feel safe. For example: “Rising sea levels aren’t going to impact us, because we don’t live near the ocean.” By initiating a debate, intellectualisation drains a topic of any emotion, and therefore suppresses anxiety. For example: “The World Bank was given X billions of pounds last year to tackle climate change, so why aren’t they doing something about it?” Pushing the problem into the laps of others, which is an unconscious admission of feeling powerless and inadequate. For example: “As long as China continues pumping out coal, there’s no point in us doing anything.” Simultaneously knowing and not knowing something — what the 1984 author George Orwell called ‘doublethink’. For example: You watch a news story about the need for urgent climate action, but it is immediately followed by a story that celebrates economic growth. Another person I contacted via the Climate Psychology Alliance was Dr. Gareth Morgan, who also talked about disavowal. A clinical psychologist and University of Leicester lecturer, Dr. Morgan says our widespread practice of disavowal means that: “The messages people are getting from society are contradictory, and it has the effect of people not staying with the threat [of the climate and ecological crisis] for long.” Dr. Morgan categorises the four processes listed above as threat responses. For instance, when I try to talk about the climate and ecological crisis with my friends and family, I am reminding them of an enormous threat. For some, it is the first time that the true extent of this threat has been described to them. In turn, they deploy a threat response. All of us perform threat responses, usually involuntarily. For example, being distrustful of strangers helps us avoid unpredictable threats. Another response — numbing ourselves with drugs — can keep overwhelming threats at a (mental) distance. We instinctively perform threat responses for good reasons: We want to protect ourselves and our loved ones. A common threat response I have received is deflection: “You should talk to a psychologist or counsellor about your climate crisis anxiety.” I am definitely not the only one, because Dr. Morgan has contributed to a new theoretical paper that explores this phenomenon. Titled The Power Threat Meaning Framework and the Climate and Ecological Crises, the paper argues that turning eco-anxiety into an individual’s problem is a logical response from a capitalist’s perspective. As Dr. Morgan argues: ""What we don’t need is more one-to-one therapy, or more pathologizing of individuals. What we do need [are] more opportunities to bring people together, and more collective action. We need those in positions of power to act and use their power."" Individualising my distress paves the way for psychiatric or psychological ‘treatments’ for my reaction to the climate crisis – a crisis that capitalism is perpetuating. Capitalism necessitates individualisation so that we continue consuming. If my anxiety regarding the climate and ecological crisis is regarded as a problem within me, an individual, I can be sold solutions. I can therefore be ‘treated’ for my mental health problems rather than changing the systems that have created the climate and ecological crisis, and my anxiety. This leaves everyday business free to carry on as normal. My loved ones are not to blame. Rather, those who attempt to individualise my eco-anxiety are simply offering what seems to be an obvious solution to many who’ve been raised in a society that values the individual over the community. ""Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine."" – Mary Oliver, American poet Aspey told me that we all deserve and require emotional support from our loved ones — it’s how we’ve evolved as a species. This sentiment echoes what Dr. Morgan says above, and is one of XR’s core tenets: We’ll only get through this crisis as a collective. Indeed, it’s why XR demands citizens’ assemblies. If members of your personal collective aren’t willing to confront the enormous threat that the climate crisis represents, it is crucial that you find like-minded communities. If you don’t, you might follow in my footsteps and find out the hard way that you can’t cope. The CPA offers a few ways to find such communities. It champions Climate Cafés, which you might have heard about. Available across the UK in-person (and anywhere online), you can sit down with a drink and openly express with others how you feel about the climate and ecological crisis. Search online for digital and in-person Climate Cafés near you. You’ll find lots of organisations that run these get-togethers. The CPA also offers training for people looking to set up a Climate Café. Or, try a free course of three one-hour sessions with a CPA counsellor who acknowledges the climate crisis; I found this programme extremely cathartic. Another initiative is The Work That Reconnects. The teachings of Joanna Macy lie at the heart of this network, which emerged in the late 1970s. Macy is a scholar of Buddhism, general systems theory, and deep ecology, who teaches that we must first re-establish our place in the natural world before going forth into action. A network of facilitators run The Work That Reconnects workshops online and in-person; Linda Aspey is currently supporting one such workshop programme for Just Stop Oil activists. When any of us find like-minded communities that make us feel understood and safe, it’s tempting to lose sight of everybody else. Being tribal might sound quite fun, and the security of belonging is alluring, but don’t forget how polarised our societies already are: vaxxers vs. anti-vaxxers; QAnon vs. ANTIFA; alt-right vs. communists. Whatever your personal take on these perceived binaries, polarisation makes us increasingly incapable of cooperation, tolerance, and mutual respect. We won’t survive this crisis if we divide into warring tribes. In Katharine Hayhoe’s book Saving Us, Canada’s most famous Christian climate scientist writes: ""Connecting with one another is how we change ourselves, how we change others, and ultimately, how we change the world. It’s contagious."" Try not to pull away from those you love, despite how they make you feel when you talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Believe me, I know this is not easy. Here are some thoughts or ideas you might find useful in re-framing your communication patterns with loved ones: Your loved ones are far more likely to listen to you than a random environmental expert they’ve never met. You will not cause a friend or family member to have an earth-shattering philosophical epiphany with your genius environmental arguments, but you might plant a seed. XR’s How to Have a Conversation with a Climate Change Sceptic has some good tips. The non-profit organisation Climate Outreach, which operates on the basis that ‘a social mandate underpins climate action,’ offers a free handbook and several webinars on How to Have a Climate Change Conversation. ""Example, whether good or bad, has a powerful influence"" – George Washington, first President of the United States Talking about the climate and ecological crisis with your loved ones is a valuable form of climate action. It is difficult to disrupt social harmony and tempting to sink into antipathy, but, as Joanna Macy says, “Of all the dangers we face, from climate change to nuclear wars, none is so great as the deadening of our response.” Just don’t forget that, alongside action, we also need help, support, and love in these difficult times.

The project rides the wave of the Solarpunk movement and grew from the belief that imagining a better future is the first step towards creating it. The power of collective and radical imagination helps to inspire action against unjust, destructive futures by actively building towards the future we want to see. The following stories - 'City Starlight' (winning entry, with original artwork by Rita Fei) and 'The Cemetery' - were written by one of two winners in the 12-18 category, Katrina Eilender. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original artwork created for this story - Rita Fei I can feel the anxiety radiating through me as I paddle the kayak with slow, wide motions. What am I anxious about, you ask? Nothing in particular. That’s what is so frustrating about it - I feel it all the time, even on perfectly nice, ordinary days. I take a deep breath and try to absorb some of the tranquillity of the environment around me. The sun is almost done rising, the sky a fiery orange, with only the barest strokes of indigo around the edges alluding to the fact that it had been dark just a few minutes ago. The human world is often relatively quiet at dawn, but here in the marsh it’s the loudest time of day. Birds call and swoop down to fish, insects of a thousand types buzz with renewed fervor, and frogs make their unmistakable guitar string twangs as my kayak glides by almost silently. It’s hard to imagine that only a few decades ago these wetlands didn’t exist in the city. I start to feel better as I dock the kayak at the drop spot and climb out into the already-busy street. Bikes zoom by in the cycling lane, the trolley trundles past, and there are people everywhere, even at this hour of the morning, striding confidently to their destinations. A crowd has gathered around some kind of holo-projection, and my curiosity gets the better of me, so I head over to check it out. It’s a pop-up presentation on the history of the neighborhood. Unfortunately, I only get to watch the first few minutes before I remember that I’m already late to work. Max has already opened up shop by the time I arrive. “Joss, late again. What a surprise.” He rolls his eyes and makes a gesture of frustration with his laser fabric cutter. “I know, I’m really sorry Max. Honest to god I tried. I just-” “Oh, spare me the spiel. It’s fine. Just to get to work, we have a lot of orders to fill by this evening. Everyone wants an outfit for Stellar Night.” I start constructing some blouses according to the patterns projected on the screen, and once in a while a customer comes in and I have to show them all the fabric options and take their measurements and all that. A few online orders roll in too, nothing too complicated. Clothes-making is repetitive work, but it’s also creative, and I like doing it. It clears my mind, helps me feel focused. When my lunch break finally arrives, however, I’m eager to head straight to the used bookstore across the street. Little echoes of my earlier anxiety return as I smooth my hair and step back to look at my reflection in the window. I force myself to stop stalling - my lunch break is only an hour - and step inside. The jingle of tiny bells follows me as I push open the door. My heart swells a little as I look around. Stacks of precariously stacked paperbacks, floor to ceiling wooden shelves absolutely crammed, comfy reading chairs in the corner. I have so many happy memories here. “Joss! What’s up?”. Nora has emerged suddenly from behind a bookcase, long dark hair piled on her head and chunky sweater sleeves rolled up. “Um, I was just looking for something to read during my lunch break. Do you have anything on the history of the neighborhood? This morning there was a pop-up history exhibition that looked cool and it reminded me”. “I saw that too!”, Nora replies, running her fingers over the shelves. “It was fascinating, especially all the stuff about the battles to get cars banned. That movement started right around here. I’ve got something perfect. It’s about the change in the urban design of the area over time and the accompanying history, causes, effects, anecdotes, all of it.” She hands me a short, thick hard-cover, clearly at least a few years old. “So, what about yesterday’s book? What did you think?”, she asks. I am silent for a moment, unable to look away from the afternoon sunbeams lighting up her eyes. A fly buzzes nearby, the spell breaks, and I regain my powers of speech. “It was epic! A mix of sci-fi, philosophy, mythology - and the short story as a medium served him well..I especially loved the one about AI... what did you think?” “My favorite was the one about the killer angels. But I agree with you on all the rest- it was almost like poetry, but less tiresome, and more thought provoking. It’s my favorite book of his-” “Yes!” I exclaim, “some of his others were a little heavy handed, but this one works very well.” We talk on and on, riffing off each other, and by the time I pay for my book and leave, my break is almost over. I run back across the street, almost getting hit by a bike, but I only have time to inhale a few quick bites of my cheese sandwich before the alarm from the sorting room starts blaring. Max is already in the sorting room, fiddling with the machine controls. The sorting machine is key, it separates the old clothing into categories, types of fabric, quality level, and packs them neatly into bins so we can remake them. But we have a particularly cheap, old model from right after people stopped buying new garments, and at least once a week it gets horribly stuck on a piece of fabric and grinds to halt. Getting the machine unstuck is slow, delicate work, even more so because Max is insistent that we manage to recover the offending scrap of velvet or cotton or polyester or whatever it is without tearing it. He’s stingy that way. But even such an annoying job can’t wipe the smile off my face today. As I work, replay my conversation with Nora over and over again in my head. The rest of the afternoon passes by in a rush of deliveries and customers. I close up shop promptly at 5, and wait for Max to write me my check. “Enjoy your weekend.” I smile at him as I head out the door. I’m tired, and think of sleeping on the trolley, but by the time I get on there’s an air of festivity around, and I decide to enjoy the sights of the city instead. Everyone is rushing around like crazy, trying to get things done before sunset. Luckily, there’s no line at the bank-cum-post office. “Sheila, hi. How are you?” I ask, plunking my check down on the counter between us. She knows the drill. “Good, good. We’re having our annual Stellar Night barbecue tonight, Sydney will be there, and Maya- a bunch of people. You should come.” “Of course I’ll be there. Thanks for inviting me. Last year’s was awesome.” “So, what’s going on with you?” Sheila asks as she scans my check and deposits it into my account. “You look over the moon today. Have you finally gotten yourself a girlfriend?” “No.” I laugh awkwardly, and suddenly I find myself blurting out everything about my conversation with Nora, and how happy it made me. “You know,” she replies, “Sam first asked me out on Stellar Night, all those years ago. The first one they ever held. It wasn’t even that popular back then, not like it is now. But even so, it was the most romantic thing I’d ever seen. It feels like yesterday, and yet here we are, I’m an old hag now, and he’s an old wrinkly man!” Sheila laughs, and twirls a strand of silver hair around her finger. “I’ve never heard that story before, that is so romantic.” I sigh and lean on the counter-top. We both seem to have the same thought at the same time, and I blush beet red. “You should try your luck with Nora. Invite her to the barbecue! You never know if you don’t ask..” I open my mouth to give my standard refusal, but something stops me. I might be going crazy, but maybe it is worth a try. “You know what, I think I will. Thank you! I have to get back before the bookstore closes!” I shout on my way out the door. What a day this is shaping up to be. Am I really doing this? Now? After so many months of not even daring to imagine? I step off the trolley and run right to the bookstore. I know that if I allow myself to hesitate even a little, I’ll lose my resolve. “Oh, hi! You’re back!” Nora smiles so genuinely that it almost makes me stop in my tracks. My heart is pounding. My words tumble out of their own accord, fast and nervous and barely intelligible. “I was wondering, if you, um, wanted to go to a Stellar Night Barbecue with me tonight. I think it could be fun, there’ll be good food-” “As, like, a date?” She asks, her eyebrows raised. Time slows down. I can feel the blood rushing in my head. I have a decision to make. “Yes, as a date.” I say, slowly and with conviction. Courage is not the absence of fear, but the fortitude to continue on despite it, I remind myself. I can endure this moment of silence. And then she grins, and says “Yes, I would love to! It’s my favorite holiday!” I can’t quite believe it, at first. I give her the address, we agree on a time to meet, and oh my god this is really happening. I spend hours overthinking my outfit, and when the doorbell rings I am unprepared. My housemates tease me viciously as I run to answer it, hoping that Nora doesn’t hear them. She looks beautiful, of course. Beautiful isn’t even the right word. Radiant. “....Hi.” “Hi.” The long walk up the stairs to the roof is a little awkward, mainly because I didn’t have time to clean the house much, but Nora doesn’t seem to notice the mess. We’re too busy talking about movies, books, places we’ve been and things we want to do. Our voices bounce off the walls of the stairwell, overlap, weave together to form a kind of melody. Holding her hand feels like how just-baked cookies smell. If that makes any sense. We walk over the bridges between roofs to get to Sheila and Sam’s building. Their roof is surrounded by a white iron fence and lots of baby plants waiting to be transplanted to the neighborhood garden. The little gate creaks open, and everyone calls out ""Hello!"". Sydney is grilling bean burgers and Sheila is spooning her signature chilli into bowls. Old 2030s pop music is blasting, stuff I remember from when I was a kid. “Wanna dance?” Nora asks, taking me by surprise. No one else is dancing yet, but we do it anyway. We dance, stupidly, flinging our limbs around, having fun. I don’t feel a single drop of fear. A few people cheer, and some join us. Her skirt spins, she dips me low and I twirl her around. The colors shift across the expanse of sky, blue spreading and deepening. Exhausted, we all sit down to watch the sunset like it’s a movie. In that moment, it feels like I’m seeing our city for the first time. The skyscrapers glittering, reaching upward, the rows of low buildings lined with trees, the vertical farms in all their lush, green glory. Where all this food originated. The massive cargo ships sailing through the harbor on the evening wind, their lovely contrast of billowing white sails and flat black solar panels. The trolleys dutifully trundling forward over their routes, but mostly empty now. Everyone wants to see the spectacle that is about to unfold. A city is such an amazing achievement, I marvel. So many different people and systems, all working together in concert, to create a city that supports millions of people without harming nature. We’ve been through some horribly difficult, unjust times, and so have our parents before that all the generations stretching back before them. But look around. We’ve come out the other side. Not only did we survive, we built something beautiful. And that’s when it starts. Lights flickering off, all over the city. The sky grows darker and darker. The first few stars shine down like beacons. Cheers erupt from rooftops all around us, and I yell as loud as I can. When this holiday first started, very few buildings actually turned off their lights. People thought that because they were just a little light in an ocean of them, it didn’t make a difference either way. But most people know better now. Lights go off on every block, in every neighborhood. Each tiny light that disappears seems to reveal its parallel in the navy blue sky, sending out its signal from millions of lightyears away. By the time the sun is fully gone, the expanse above us is the deepest black, painted with hundreds of brilliant constellations. The colors of the milky way become visible, and everyone gasps. It’s magical. Like no other beauty on earth. 364 days a year, you can’t see a single star in this cram-jammed city. But for one night, we all work together to make this spectacle of majesty. Here I am, drunk on love for the universe, surrounded by friends and starlight. I decide that this moment will never come again. I lean over and kiss Nora, all the butterflies in my stomach taking flight out through my lips. She kisses me back. If all my life so far, all my sweat and blood and tears, have been only so that I can achieve this moment in time, it would all have been worth it. I break the kiss and lay down flat on the rough concrete, staring up at the stars. She leans her head on my shoulder. Humans, I decide, can do anything we set our minds to if we work together. If we have solidarity. Even me. Because I am here alive, unafraid, and I never thought that would be. We are beautiful together. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It’s already pouring by nine am, even though the forecast claimed it wouldn’t start until 3. The rain plunks onto the leaves above, then streams down in rivulets and drips from the branches, almost all of it directly onto Kurt’s head. Or at least that’s how it feels to him. “Goddamn weather channel, never right. Bunch of foolhardy schmucks.” Kurt mumbles to himself, with great satisfaction. Today is shaping up to be a good day. Not only was the weather report wrong, but the torrential rain has mostly deterred visitors, so Kurt has been free to tidy the paths, trim branches, and polish the plaques all morning. The more pleasant facet of the job, for him. But of course now he’s gone and jinxed it. The bell rings out clearly through the trees. Kurt sighs and puts his clipping shears down, shuffling slowly down the path toward the front gate. It takes his bad knee some time to kick into gear in the morning, especially when it’s rainy. Management wanted to have visitors sign in on a tablet, of all things, which would then send a message to a smart watch he would ostensibly be wearing. But Kurt put them off that idea quickly enough. It would have ruined everything they were trying to accomplish here! And besides, he thinks proudly, the bell is plenty good enough. I can hear it from any part of the forest, even in the rain. The unfortunate ringers of the bell stand huddled under the big oak, wielding a colorful assortment of umbrellas. Kurt can tell that they have just been squabbling amongst themselves about whether or not to leave, but have stopped abruptly now that he is here. An old woman, an exhausted looking middle aged couple, and a few teenagers stare at him expectantly. “Hi, I’m Kurt. I’m the caretaker here. I can walk you to the tree you’re looking for, unless you already know how to get there.” He says this last part rhetorically, because he knows all the regulars, and he’s never seen this family before. “Uh, we could use some help.” The middle aged man steps forward. “I’m Mark Davis, we’re looking for Richard and Claudia Davis. They’re together, the same tree, I think.” Mark says hesitantly. “Alright, let’s get going then.” The family takes one last look behind them at the glittering city across the river before following Kurt into the dark, dense forest. It provides some shelter from the rain, but he can see them start a little at the shadows. There is something about old forests, he thinks as he leads them up the path, that will always give people the strange feeling that they are in a fairy tale, no matter how advanced science and technology get. The human imagination triumphs. “How long has this place been around?” one of the teenagers asks, ducking her head beneath a low branch. “Well, there’s three different answers. The forest itself has been around for 400 years, give or take. Although it was heavily logged in the intervening years, so very few of the trees themselves are that old. Some of the recently planted parts are only a decade or two old. The reserve is 56 years old, but it’s been expanded a lot since then. The cemetery is only 19 years old, dates back to the Public Land & Parks Act, I’m sure you’ve learned about that in school.” “Wow.” She replies, looking around at the forest with new eyes. Now that Kurt is warmed up and in his groove, it’s hard for him to stop talking about the place that has been his life’s work. “See those mushrooms over there, on that fallen tree? Those are the kind they use to make antidepressants. Scientists used to come here to take samples back when they were first testing them.” “That’s so cool!” the other teenager, presumably her brother, exclaims. Kurt smiles to himself. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the forest and its history, but generally grieving people don’t want a chatty guide. As much as he likes being alone, it’s nice for other people to see, sometimes, why he loves this place so much. They arrive at Richard and Claudia Davis’ tree. It’s a young cedar, more than a sapling but barley. The soil it stretches its roots into was a parking lot only a few decades ago. Mark runs his fingers over the bronze plaques sticking up from the ground and looks as if he is about to cry. This is Kurt’s cue to disappear into the forest, leaving them alone with their grief. Kurt tries to go back to his work. He really does. He even picks up his clipping shears. But his feet move him towards somewhere else, and he knows he can’t fight them, stubborn as he is. As he approaches the regal old beech, he tries to pretend he came for some other purpose. To neaten up the area. But he can’t. “Hello, Maggie” he whispers, tracing the line where the soft moss gives way to rough bark. “I’m sorry I haven’t come in so long. Sometimes it’s just.. Too much. You understand. You always understood me, better than I do myself.” He swallows the lump in his throat as he looks down at all the rocks he removed, one by one, when he buried her. Still scattered around here, indestructible. “I miss you. That goes without saying.You were always wisecracking, my love. Strange as it is to say, I miss being made fun of. I’ve taken myself far too seriously since you’ve been … not here.” He takes a deep breath. Wipes the mist from his glasses. “Today I had some visitors that really made me think- wow. Look at the magnitude of what we’ve done. Look how we’ve succeeded, despite everything. You and I, we were pioneers. I, the quiet one taking care of the trees, you giving them hell in all those city council meetings. And now it’s really happened. We’ve preserved an old-growth forest intact, grown it, created a massive carbon sink, protected biodiversity.” He hadn’t talked this way for years and years, not since people stopped needing to be convinced. “But you and I both know it’s not just that. It’s more than the sum of its parts, more than numbers on a meter. It’s a place of comfort, a place where the cycle of life can happen. The trees absorb nutrients, distribute some to the younger, weaker ones, talk with each other constantly using tiny electrical impulses transmitted by the fungi, which feeds on dead trees. The microorganisms assume a million different roles taken on by billions of species, and the insects who sing and light up the night and the birds and the deer and the wolves and everything else. We only understand a fraction of it, there is so much more that we don’t even know about yet, that we may never know.” His eyes crinkle up as he smiles. “Isn't it amazing that such a system exists? That we helped save it? That we’re a part of it all? Isn’t it so heartbreakingly beautiful? Humans have such an obsession with straight lines. But nothing is a straight line, that’s missing the point entirely. Everything is a circle. Circles within circles within circles, until the end of time….I know you would laugh at that long, ponderous speech. But all of it is to say, Maggie my love, don’t worry about me. I’m not alone. I’m never alone, here in the imperfect Eden we loved. No one ever is.” With that Kurt turns around and starts to walk back to the maple grove, shears in hand. It’s time to stop blathering on and go back to doing. He steps forward with confidence, only to trip over a thick, twisted beech root, falling to the ground with a muffled thud. “One more prank, eh Maggie?” he asks, getting to his feet. And then the sound of an old man laughing fills the air, loud, ugly, happy, in a way it hasn’t for a long time. If you listen carefully, you might even hear the trees joining in. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/05/13/global-newsletter-64/,"Rebels scale insurance giant Lloyd’s of London, rally at Wall Street in New York, and settle down on the streets of Paris. In this issue: NYC Uprising | Paris Inevitable Rebellion | London April Rebellion Dear rebels, Winter has retreated from the Northern hemisphere, and seeds of rebellion have been sprouting in some of its largest and most iconic cities. Last month saw three sustained campaigns of direct action launch across London, New York, and Paris in quick succession. Streets were occupied, banks blockaded, oil company offices infiltrated, and greenwashing newspapers went undelivered. Together these rebellions harnessed the loving rage of thousands of climate activists, and you can read reports about all three in Action Highlights. Hundreds of rebels march through London on the first day of The April Rebellion. While we’ve laid out yet another feast of rebellious action for you this month, there’s also the bitter aftertaste of political intransigence. The Inevitable Rebellion in Paris emerged after national elections that ignored the climate crisis and reinstalled a President whose current policies come nowhere near delivering on his government’s own emission targets. Meanwhile the American President announced the return of leases for domestic fossil fuel drilling as rebels marched through New York. And just days after the rebellion in London, the UK government cemented its plan to accelerate domestic oil and gas production, then passed repressive anti-protest laws that could see future rebellions marred by unlimited fines and jail time. The NYPD showed some surprising leniency during the New York Uprising. Find out how and why, in Action Highlights. With carbon dioxide levels hitting record highs and deadly weather extremes now a permanent fixture of the news cycle, the response of our leaders is sad, sickening, and suicidal. It’s got so bad that even the cops of the New York Police Department seem to have had enough. Rebellion is presently raging across Scandinavia (as we'll report next issue), and plans for multinational rebellions in the summer are well underway (see Upcoming Actions). Now is the time to get more involved in your local XR group and see what you can do to help end this madness. *Subscribe to the Global Newsletter and get it in your inbox every month!

Support the Rebellion APRIL 15 - 23 | New York, USA Rebels rally outside NBC. The TV network closed up and erected barricades before they got there. Rebels in New York have taken their climate activism to the next level, launching a sustained campaign of both arrestable and family-friendly actions across the city. The Spring Uprising targeted American media companies for their climate silence, and American banks for their fossil fuel investments. XR NYC was joined by rebels and other activists from across the region, including groups from Boston, Philadelphia, and even Minnesota. The most attention-grabbing action was the successful blockade of a press printing plant, which meant copies of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal didn’t make it onto the shelves that day. The titles were targeted for their greenwashing advertising. It took police over six hours to cut rebels free from the plant’s driveway and arrest them. A New York Times employee drove into the printing plant blockade, knocking back a rebel on a tripod. Rebels jumped onto the car, and the driver was detained by police. In an unprecedented display of leniency, the NYPD then let rebels blockading a separate staff entrance go free, and take all their gear home with them, including barrels, sleeping dragons, tripods, and a boat! An NYC rebel believes this strange sympathy for our cause stems from the freakish rainstorms in the city back in September. Police scrambled to save New Yorkers from the resultant flash floods, but couldn’t stop 13 people from drowning in basement apartments. “After those floods, many in the police realised XR was highlighting a crisis that they would be the clean-up crew for. Since then, small signals of support from the police just keep coming.” A “We Will Not Be Bystanders” rally took place on the 2nd day of the uprising. 13 rebels were arrested for blocking the road. The Spring Uprising launched with hundreds marching through Manhattan to the headquarters of NBC News and ABC News. The TV networks were targeted for their superficial coverage of the climate emergency. On later days, rebels blocked roads in the city’s financial district, demanding that their tax dollars stop being used to fund war and environmental destruction. They also occupied the reception of Citigroup’s corporate HQ. The bank is globally the second largest funder of fossil fuel companies, and the largest funder of US coal. Across the eight days of action, a total of 78 rebels were arrested, and XR NYC has been so inundated with new recruits that they’re holding special onboarding events both online and off to process them all. With the US President announcing that leases for domestic fossil fuel drilling are back on sale, those fresh-faced rebels are needed more than ever. Find out more about the Spring Uprising and follow XR NYC on Twitter. 16 - 18 APRIL | Paris, France Many hundreds of rebels set up camp under the Saint Denis gate in Paris. “When voting is not enough, rebellion is inevitable”. The motto of this three-day action in Paris rings true. The rebellion for a different, better, kinder world is, indeed, inevitable. In the recent national elections, French rebels found themselves in a no-win situation. Their only choice was between a right-wing extremist and a neoliberal president who had done nothing to respond to the climate crisis during his past five years in office. With the public debate consumed by right-wing talking points, less than 5% of election airtime was dedicated to discussing the environment. To oppose this blanket denialism by France’s political and media elite, 1500 rebels took to the streets of the capital and occupied the square surrounding the Saint Denis gate. The XR symbol was unfurled from atop the gate in front of a cheering crowd. There they created a democratic space where people could meet, exchange ideas, and listen to speeches. Activists, experts, and everyday citizens gathered to consider questions such as how to revive democracy, and how to tackle climate and energy injustices. Concerts and jam sessions completed the rich programme. Extensive coverage of the action by French and international media brought the environmental crisis back into the spotlight. Even the President was forced to address the issue, though his promises of an eco-friendly second term rang hollow after so many broken promises. XR France will judge him by his actions. After the Inevitable Rebellion inevitably came to a close, several participants decided to remain on the site in their own right. “We wanted to free up a democratic space, and so we did”, writes XR France. “We hope that beautiful ideas and exciting new projects emerge from this citizen movement.” Find out more about XR France actions and follow them on Twitter. Rebels sat atop hay bales and tripods as they occupied the busy central square. 9 - 16 APRIL | London, UK Rebels march through central London’s shopping district to open The Spring Rebellion. Rebellion has again broken out in the city where it all started. After an amazing prelude that saw rebels join forces with Just Stop Oil to blockade oil terminals, The April Rebellion formally launched with a mass demonstration through central London. Thousands of rebels marched through the city over the week of actions, using mass sit-downs to block traffic and calling for an immediate end to all new fossil fuel projects. As the rebel crowds ground the capital to a halt and samba drums filled the air, a series of direct actions were launched from the protest fringes. This ‘Scientist for XR’ was later hospitalised after going on hunger-strike in her cell. More than 60 rebels blockaded Lloyd’s of London, shutting down the insurance giant for a day. Lloyd’s insures some of the world’s worst fossil fuel projects, including The Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion in Western Canada. Shell’s newly-located HQ in London was also targeted, with nine rebels infiltrating the building, most glueing themselves to reception, and one reaching the eighth floor. Outside, protesters held up placards bearing the names of the Shell employees within, inviting them to be a part of XRUK’s whistleblower project. ‘Scientists for XR’ glued themselves and scientific journals to the UK Energy ministry to highlight how the government is ignoring climate science. One ecologist went on hunger and thirst strike after she was arrested but refused bail. The pink octopus returned for some outreach at the London Science Museum. While this new design of rebellion - mobile, adaptable, infrastructure-free - succeeded in causing major disruption and evading a police shutdown, it’s clear that the social impact of these rebellions is starting to diminish in the UK. Since The April Rebellion, the government has called for the acceleration of domestic oil and gas production in the North Sea, and overseen the introduction of repressive new laws that could mean huge fines and jail time for rebels attending future protests. But XRUK has refused to be intimidated or disheartened. They have launched outreach campaigns to both train up and expand their movement, and are exploring new strategies that include working more concretely with resistance groups in the Global South. Despite the authoritarian moves by their government, UK rebels will keep evolving their tactics and forging new partnerships for the even bigger rebellion planned in September.

After many hours, activist lawyers managed to get them out on bail. The country has been rocked by huge anti-government protests after an economic crash caused food and fuel prices to soar. Rebels had braved violent police crackdowns to demand a transition to renewable energy. The country receives ample sunlight throughout the year but remains wedded to fossil fuels. Expect more info next issue. 27 APRIL | Germany Activists from climate group Last Generation turned off crude oil pipelines at several locations in Germany. They entered emergency shut-off stations and turned valves with their own hands, later decorating them with sunflowers. 25 - 29 APRIL | Stockholm, Sweden Rebels launched a ‘Fossil Rebellion’ across the Swedish capital for five days (their longest ever campaign!) to push their government to stop all fossil fuel subsidies. Full report in the next issue. 25 APRIL | Johannesburg, South Africa Rebels have repeatedly protested outside Standard Bank’s HQ, demanding that the bank stop investing in the terrifying East African Crude Oil Pipeline. Photo: Julia Evans 22 APRIL | Bogotá, Colombia Despite being one of the most dangerous countries to protest in, rebels led a coalition of activists through the capital to rally against fracking. Pilot fracking projects are already underway in the country. 22 APRIL | Buenos Aires, Argentina The Violet Brigade, who symbolise the possibility of transitioning to another system, accompany the Earth Day march through the capital. 12 - 21 APRIL | Hanko, Finland Rebels and Greenpeace activists blocked a train bringing Russian coal into the country. After an amazing 10 day stretch, 5 rebels were finally taken into custody. They called on their government to stop fueling war and ban the import of Russian fossil fuels.

We are a global team planning to pressure wealthy countries into paying their Debt For Climate. How do they do this? By renegotiating the financial debts that burden Global South countries, so the money can be spent on a just transition. With the stroke of a pen, we can keep trillions of dollars worth of fossil fuels in the ground and free impoverished nations from debt. We must take to the streets all over the world and build the necessary pressure to bring it about. We are calling for the first global mobilisation to happen during the G7 summit in June.

That is, it’s not about climate science, the possibilities for renewable energy, or the dire environmental consequences of business-as-usual. No, it’s about politics and money—it’s about the role the oil and gas industry has played on the world stage for decades now. But we know climate change is no longer a problem of science or engineering or even public willingness—it’s a problem of politics and of money. And that makes Blowout as close to “required reading” as we are likely to see. Maddow’s style is intensely journalistic. She doesn’t make vague pronouncements. She doesn’t lob personal insults or take cheap shots. In clear, respectful, even sympathetic terms, she explains exactly who did what, where, and on what date. And if that means outing a major national leader for using organised crime to make trouble-makers “go away”, so be it. She explains the power and reach of the oil and gas industry and its startlingly corrupt political allies, and how they run—and ruin—so much of the world.

Abdo, a 9-year-old Syrian boy in a Greek refugee camp, was given a camera and asked to photograph what was important to him and talk about his choice… I love trees so much, but I couldn't get the full picture of this one. I like this tree the most though. It's the most beautiful, it looks like a painting. It's pointy at the top, a perfect tree. And I also asked the tree permission to take her picture and she said yes. It reminds me of the greenery in Ladkia - there was a tree there that looks like this one and I loved it, too. So when I saw this, I loved it too. It looks like one of those ancient trees, they’ve been through everything and have seen it all. They’ve seen refugees from all over the world, they witness our lives. Allah loves trees, and created them to be good for us. Nature is good to us and cares for us, I feel safe when I am around it. And trees never die until somebody harms them, that's why God punishes those who cut trees down. However long they live, the tree sees everything and never forgets. Every leaf on it protects you, so every time you pick a leaf, you'll be punished. Each leaf was born for a purpose and has a past and a story. For every refugee it sees, a new leaf grows. It protects us from the sun. The prophet Mohammed loved trees too, this tree is a source of strength in the camp.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/05/12/debt-for-climate-xr-mapa/,"This call to action on 'Debt for Climate' from XR Most Affected Peoples and Areas is published below in English, then Spanish,and French. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear friends in Extinction Rebellion Global North, We are XR MAPA (Most Affected Peoples and Areas) and we write to you with an invitation and request for solidarity actions together. XR MAPA, and a coalition of grassroots groups from labour, indigenous communities, social and environmental movements across the Global South and North, are organising decentralised actions at the time of the G7 in the campaign Debt for Climate. Our aim is to get the concept of Debt for Climate on the global agenda at the G7 through coordinated actions across the globe – some are actions of mass mobilisation, others smaller solidarity actions, and in places where disruption is politically possible, they are actions of targeted disruption. All added together, this could be unprecedented global action connecting social justice with climate justice. Basically, it’s not just that fossil fuels are at the core of the economies, it’s also that inequality on the planet is fossilised into the global financial structure. It will take a mighty push to jolt that inequity out of place. But if trillions of dollars were to be shifted from the debt infrastructure towards the just transition, well, that would be a start in the right direction. To make that tilt happen, we are going to need tens of thousands if not millions to join the campaign. Most of the nations of South America and Africa have less economic and political power than many of the private companies or multinational corporations that rule the world market today, generally from the Global North. This context binds the region to financial fragility and economic dependence, reinforcing the colonialism of the Global North over the South. Countries in the Global South are suffering, they have no exit plan and are burdened with odious debts. For many years the countries of the Global North have used the same tactic, protected by a ruthless and predatory economic system, to pressure for the payment of an illegitimate debt that only succeeds in keeping the countries of the South in extreme poverty, devastating entire communities and their biodiversity on a large-scale. In this way, large corporations of the Global North negotiate contracts that allow the constant plundering of their territories through the export of commodities and extraction of fossil fuels, minerals, and other resources. Such is the case of the monoculture of transgenic crops in Argentina, in its attempt to pay its illegitimate debt with the IMF, or the seismic exploration that the Norwegian state company Equinor intends to carry out in the Argentinean Sea to extract oil. It applies to the persistent attempts by Shell and Total to apply for drilling licences on the South African coast despite being defeated in court cases twice this year. It applies throughout the Global South. All this translates into the fact that, in order to maintain the standards of living and comfort of the population of the countries of the Global North, the extraction of resources from other regions of the world continues unabated. The cancellation of debt contracts would allow Global South resource rich countries to keep fossil fuels in the ground, in exchange for debt cancellation. We will be taking action from Argentina to Zambia, but we urgently need more of the Global North countries to be targeted with sustained campaigns. The obvious targets are first and foremost the governments of the G7 countries, the offices of the World Bank and the IMF, and Embassies of the G7 across the world. Many Global South groups are far from such targets and living in repressive situations so will be participating in video statements, creative actions, and social media posts – adding to the wave of voices from wherever they are. Global North groups could do this too, but in addition, they could jointly spread the call for Debt for Climate until it’s so loud it can’t be avoided. The G7 meeting in Germany is the start.Maybe the campaign seems unrealistically ambitious. But what is the point of anything less than revolution at this moment in time? Our aim is to mobilize all over the world together with social movements and labour unions to demand that the world's richest countries, which make up the G7 and control international lending institutions like the IMF and World Bank, begin to pay their climate debt by cancelling the debts of the Global South to finance keeping fossil fuels in the ground and fund the just transition. Various forces are coalescing at this moment and we must take advantage of this brief window. Now is the time! We urge you to join us in this seminal campaign. With much love and the rage that keeps away despair, XR MAPA Here are our contact details: xrmapa@protonmail.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Queridos amigos de Extinction Rebellion Global North, Somos XR MAPA (Most Affected Peoples and Areas / Personas y Areas Más Afectadas) y les escribimos con una invitación y petición de acciones solidarias en conjunto. XR MAPA y una coalición de grupos de base de trabajadores, comunidades indígenas, movimientos sociales y medioambientales de todo el Sur y el Norte Global, estamos organizando acciones descentralizadas con motivo del G7 en la campaña Deuda por Clima. Nuestro objetivo es conseguir que el concepto de Deuda por el Clima se incluya en la agenda global del G7 a través de acciones coordinadas en todo el mundo, algunas de movilización masiva, otras acciones de solidaridad más pequeñas, y en los lugares donde la disrupción es políticamente posible, acciones de disrupción dirigida. Todo ello, sumado, podría ser una acción global sin precedentes que conecte la justicia social con la justicia climática. Básicamente, no es sólo que los combustibles fósiles estén en el centro de las economías, sino que la desigualdad en el planeta está perpetrada en la estructura financiera global. Se necesitará una gran mobilización para acabar con esa desigualdad. Pero si se desviaran billones de dólares destinados al pago de la deuda hacia una transición justa, sería un comienzo en la dirección correcta. Para que ese cambio se produzca, vamos a necesitar que decenas de miles, se unan a la campaña. La mayoría de las naciones de América del Sur y África tienen menos poder económico y político que muchas de las empresas privadas o corporaciones multinacionales que hoy rigen el mercado del mundo, generalmente provenientes del norte global. Este contexto doblega a la región a una fragilidad financiera y dependencia económica, reforzando el colonialismo del norte global sobre el sur. Durante muchos años los países del norte global han utilizado la misma táctica, protegidos por un sistema económico despiadado y depredador, presionar para el pago de una Deuda ilegitima que solo logra mantener a los países del sur en extrema pobreza, devastando a gran escala comunidades enteras y su biodiversidad. En este sentido, las grandes corporaciones del norte global, negocian contratos millonarios que permiten el constante saqueo de sus territorios a través de la exportación de commodities y extracción de combustibles fósiles, minerales y demás recursos. Tal es el caso del monocultivo de transgénicos en Argentina, en su intento por pagar su deuda ilegitima con el FMI, o la exploración sísmica que la empresa estatal de Noruega Equinor intenta hacer en el mar argentino parea extraer petróleo. Asi como los persistentes intentos de Shell y Total de solicitar licencias de perforación en la costa sudafricana, a pesar de haber sido derrotados en los tribunales dos veces este año. Se aplica a todo el Sur Global. Todo esto se traduce en el hecho de que, para mantener los niveles de vida y el confort de la población de los países del Norte Global, la extracción de recursos de otras regiones del mundo continúa sin cesar. La anulación de los contratos de deuda permitiría a los países del Sur Global ricos en recursos mantener los combustibles fósiles bajo tierra. Actuaremos desde Argentina hasta Zambia, pero necesitamos urgentemente que más países del Norte Global sean objeto de campañas sostenidas. Los principales puntos de movilización son, en primer lugar, los gobiernos de los países del G7, las oficinas del Banco Mundial y del FMI y las embajadas del G7 en todo el mundo. Muchos grupos del Sur Global están lejos de esos objetivos y viven en situaciones de represión, por lo que participarán en declaraciones en vídeo, acciones creativas y publicaciones en las redes sociales, sumándose a la ola de voces desde dondequiera que estén. Los grupos del Norte Global también podrían hacer esto, pero además podrían difundir conjuntamente el llamamiento a la Deuda por el Clima hasta que sea tan fuerte que no se pueda evitar. La reunión del G7 en Alemania es el comienzo. Puede que la campaña parezca poco realista y ambiciosa. Pero en este punto, todo lo que no sea revolución tiene sentido? Nuestro objetivo es movilizarnos en todo el mundo junto con movimientos sociales y sindicatos para exigir que los países más ricos del mundo, que conforman el G7 y controlan las instituciones internacionales de crédito como el FMI y el Banco Mundial, que comiencen a pagar su deuda climática, y a su vez cancelen las deudas del Sur Global que son principalmente pagadas a traves de la extracción de combustibles fósiles, y de esta manera poder enfocarse en una transición justa. Varias fuerzas se están uniendo en este momento y debemos aprovechar esta breve ventana. ¡Ahora es el momento! Te invitamos a que te unas a nosotros en esta campaña global. Con mucho amor y la furia, se aleja la desesperación, XR MAPA Para más información contactanos: xrmapa@protonmail.com ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Chers amis d’Extinction Rebellion du Nord Global, Nous sommes XR MAPA (Most Affected Peoples and Areas / Population et zones le plus touchées). et nous vous écrivons pour vous inviter et vous demander de mener ensemble des actions de solidarité. XR MAPA, et une coalition de groupes populaires issus du monde du travail, des communautés autochtones, des mouvements sociaux et environnementaux du Sud et du Nord, organisent des actions décentralisées au moment du G7 dans le cadre de la campagne Debt for Climate. Notre objectif est d'amener le concept de la dette pour le climat à l'ordre du jour du G7 par le biais d'actions coordonnées à travers le monde - certaines sont déjà des actions de mobilisation de masse, d'autres des actions de solidarité plus modestes, et dans les endroits où la perturbation est politiquement possible, ce sont des actions de perturbation ciblée. Si l'on additionne toutes ces actions, il pourrait s'agir d'une action mondiale sans précédent reliant la justice sociale à la justice climatique. Fondamentalement, ce n'est pas uniquement les combustibles fossiles qui sont au coeur des économies, c'est aussi l'inégalité sur la planète qui est fossilisée dans la structure financière mondiale. Il faudra une forte impulsion pour faire bouger cette inégalité. Mais si des milliers de milliards de dollars étaient transférés de l'infrastructure de la dette vers une transition juste, ce serait un début dans la bonne direction. Pour que ce basculement se produise, nous aurons besoin de dizaines de milliers, voire de millions, de personnes pour rejoindre la campagne. La plupart des nations d'Amérique du Sud et d'Afrique ont moins de pouvoir économique et politique que bon nombre des entreprises privées ou multinationales qui règnent aujourd'hui sur le marché mondial, généralement issues du Nord global. Ce contexte lie la région à la fragilité financière et à la dépendance économique, renforçant le colonialisme du Nord global sur le Sud. Les pays du Sud souffrent, ils n'ont pas de plan de sortie et sont accablés de dettes odieuses. Depuis de nombreuses années, les pays du Nord global utilisent la même tactique, protégée par un système économique impitoyable et prédateur, pour faire pression sur le paiement d'une dette illégitime qui ne réussit qu'à maintenir les pays du Sud dans une extrême pauvreté, dévastant à grande échelle des communautés entières et leur biodiversité. De cette manière, les grandes entreprises du Nord négocient des contrats qui permettent le pillage constant de leurs territoires par l'exportation de marchandises et l'extraction de combustibles fossiles, de minéraux et d'autres ressources. C'est le cas de la monoculture de cultures transgéniques en Argentine, dans sa tentative de payer sa dette illégitime auprès du FMI, ou de l'exploration sismique que l'entreprise publique norvégienne Equinor entend réaliser dans la mer argentine pour en extraire du pétrole. Il s'applique aux tentatives persistantes de Shell et de Total de demander des licences de forage sur la côte sud-africaine, bien qu'elles aient été rejetées par les tribunaux à deux reprises cette année. Cela s'applique à l'ensemble du Sud mondial. Tout cela se traduit par le fait que, pour maintenir le niveau de vie et le confort de la population des pays du Nord, l'extraction des ressources d'autres régions du monde se poursuit sans relâche. L'annulation des contrats de dette permettrait aux pays du Sud riches en ressources de conserver les combustibles fossiles dans le sol, en échange de l'annulation de la dette. Nous agirons de l'Argentine à la Zambie, mais il est urgent que davantage de pays du Nord soient visés par des campagnes soutenues. Les cibles évidentes sont avant tout les gouvernements des pays du G7, les bureaux de la Banque mondiale et du FMI, et les ambassades du G7 dans le monde. De nombreux groupes du Sud sont loin de ces cibles et vivent dans des situations de répression. Ils participeront donc à des déclarations vidéo, des actions créatives et des messages sur les réseaux sociaux, amplifiant ainsi les actions, où qu’elles se trouvent. Les groupes de l'hémisphère nord pourraient faire de même, mais ils pourraient également diffuser conjointement l'appel à la dette pour le climat jusqu'à ce qu'il soit si fort qu'il ne puisse être évité. La réunion du G7 en Allemagne en est le point de départ. La campagne semble peut-être trop ambitieuse pour être réaliste. Mais à quoi bon faire moins qu'une révolution à ce moment précis? Notre objectif est de nous mobiliser dans le monde entier avec les mouvements sociaux et les syndicats pour exiger que les pays les plus riches du monde, qui composent le G7 et contrôlent les institutions internationales de prêt comme le FMI et la Banque mondiale, commencent à payer leur dette climatique en annulant les dettes du Sud pour financer le maintien des combustibles fossiles dans le sol et financer la transition juste. Diverses forces se rassemblent en ce moment et nous devons profiter de cette brève fenêtre. C'est maintenant qu'il faut agir ! Nous vous invitons à vous joindre à nous dans cette campagne décisive.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/04/25/protecting-nature-words-matter/,"Photo by Pok Rie, Pexels ‘Sustainable ocean management ’. ‘Natural capital ’. ‘Ecosystem services ’. What’s wrong with these terms? They seem innocent enough, but they could be helping to maintain the prevailing view of nature which has led us to the climate and ecological emergency in the first place. Language can mould our thoughts and influence the way we perceive the world. Some labels and expressions anchor us to an outdated mindset which is holding us back. We could begin by ditching ones which imply that nature exists to serve humankind and others indicating that what matters most in this world is money. We often hear about needing system change to end our assault on the natural world and tackle the climate crisis. I believe that re-thinking the language we use to speak about nature and conservation is pivotal in helping propel this change. The words we use to talk about nature might seem incidental. What does it matter if certain language reflects the master-servant dynamic between humankind and the natural world if we are more likely to stop clear-felling forests, extracting fossil-fuels and emptying seas? When it comes to taking protective action, it is becoming clear that we have a more profound problem to face, which underpins any new policy or initiative: how we regard the natural world in general and the way we see ourselves within it. The industrial revolution ‘de-natured’ societies, putting millions of us in towns and cities of concrete, glass and steel. We became detached from the wild places we once inhabited and from the wild creatures living around us. Nature became a stranger. As journalist Ian Johnston writes, “simply put, humans don’t protect what they don’t know and value”. Given that language can shape our thoughts and attitudes, and the way we think determines what we do, it follows that the words and expressions used in planning policies and devising strategies to protect nature matter considerably. As a writer on marine conservation I come across some terminology I’m not comfortable with . ‘Fish stocks’ for instance gives the impression that wild fish living in the sea exist purely for human consumption, like tins of beans in the kitchen cupboard or on a supermarket shelf. Rather, they are populations of wild fish. Fish farms in Indonesia, by Tom Fisk, Pexels Another example is ‘ocean management’ which appears in many government reports, on NGO websites, in articles, books and discussions. In my mind, the concept of people managing an ocean is implausible. Modern humans have been around for about 200,000 years, while the oceans have existed for almost as long as the Earth itself. They were formed roughly 3.8 billion years ago, which makes oceans 19,000 times as old as humans. ‘Ocean management’ suggests that we have control over the sea – Earth’s largest and wildest natural system. We can prevent ocean destruction and misuse by introducing tough controls on how people use the sea and drastically reduce commercial and industrial exploitation – but that is people management, not ocean management. Photo by Sebastian Voortman, Pexels Today’s technologies and expertise make it possible to enforce protective laws even in the remotest seas. Compliance controls for commercial fishing for instance, can include; all vessels being fitted with a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and an Automatic Identification System (AIS) for surveillance and tracking their positions at sea; having independent observers on board; patrol ships in operation; strict licensing and a catch documentation scheme to prove that fish were caught legally. These methods are protecting wildlife in 13,800,000 square miles of the Southern Ocean, which equates to approximately 10 percent of the global ocean surface. Here, human activity, such as commercial fishing and mining, is prohibited or strictly regulated by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources – its purpose made explicit in Article II of the Treaty; ‘the objective of this Convention is the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.’ People management for the ocean is about pressure management. The sea and marine life need a break from us. And although it isn’t possible to leave oceans alone completely, it is possible to ease the pressure on them enough to allow water and wildlife to begin to recover. When waters are left undisturbed, sealife can become plentiful again. To illustrate just how much, one study covering 124 marine reserves found that the average mass of animals and plants within them (biomass) more than quadrupled in three years: better is possible. The Natural Capital Declaration was launched in 2012 at the UN Conference, Rio + 20. The UN Environment Programme describes it as, ‘a commitment by CEOs from the finance sector to work towards integrating natural capital criteria into their products and services’. Capital is usually defined as a large amount of money (or other economic asset) used to produce more wealth. So what is ‘natural capital’? The World Bank defines it as ‘assets like forests, water, fish stocks, minerals, biodiversity and land’. But isn’t that nature? It is, but the giveaway word there is ‘assets’, because ‘natural capital’ is nature valued through the prism of profits and losses. Image by Towfiqu Barbhuiya, Unsplash What is this forest, this wetland, what are these minerals worth to us, to our shareholders, to our customers? In other words, if we start referring to nature as 'natural capital', we are putting a material value on it, and if we do that we're more likely to protect it - and that's a good thing isn’t it? But, the inference is that it’s only worth protecting if there’s a buck to be made, or a buck to be lost. The intrinsic value of nature – nature for nature’s sake – doesn’t appear to count in the 'natural capital' construct. In the process of trying to commodify nature, very differing habitats are quantified according to their perceived equivalence – barely taking account of a particular ecosystem’s complexities and endemic species – mistakenly assuming that the ruin of one habitat can be compensated by manufacturing another, such as by funding a tree plantation, perhaps thousands of miles away. Similarly, carbon offsetting is a way for companies and individuals to balance out their CO₂ emissions (or carbon footprint) by making contributions to carbon reduction schemes, perhaps in reforestation or renewable energy. Calling it ‘offsetting’ gives the impression that tinkering with the problem will be enough, when root and branch change is needed. The slogan could be, “Pay off your carbon guilt and carry on, business as usual”. Critics argue that the system (and the thinking behind it) enables high carbon lifestyles and commercial operations to continue, virtually as before – when we need genuine, decarbonising action at all levels and in all sectors of society. The natural-capital-offsetting approach can also result in construction, extractive, and polluting projects of companies in the Global North misappropriating land in the Global South in the name of conservation, and in many cases without the consent or engagement of people living there, who may become dispossessed as a consequence. Rights to inhabit lands and use resources that were previously publicly or privately owned are then lost to corporate control. This is known as green grabbing, or green colonialism -- and colonialism is as much about extending power over peoples and territory as it is about accumulating wealth. Photo by Manny Becerra, Unsplash Green colonialism enables the Global North to maintain a high standard of living, frequently at the expense of communities in the Global South. For example, a renewable energy company may be granted permission from the government to clear an area to construct a series of wind turbines, while the people living there are forced off their land. ‘Natural capital’ has a sidekick called ‘ecosystem services’. Simplistically speaking, they are what we get from the natural world – or, as defined by the United Nations, ‘the benefits people derive from ecosystems’ (if you can call being alive a benefit). As well as essential resources like crops, fresh water and timber, they are the natural systems and processes which keep the planet going, such as the carbon, water and nitrogen cycles; pollination; water filtration; decomposition; oxygen production; climate moderation; and disease control. Although ‘ecosystem services thinking’ acknowledges the value of nature’s non-monetary benefits (spiritual, cultural and recreational rewards), in many government departments a growing number of policy-makers maintain, as they do for natural capital, that to make wiser policy decisions in protecting nature’s ‘services’ we should focus mainly on their economic value. “Let’s monetise the natural systems which support life. What are they worth to us?” Photo by Bones64, Pixabay Consequently, nature’s usefulness is measured according to the market; by what people are prepared to pay to protect a particular wetland or forest perhaps, and what it would cost to replace or regenerate it. The approach attempts to put a dollar worth not only on rivers, forests, seas, on the soil, on clean air, on millions of plant and animal species, but also on Earth’s physical, biological and chemical systems – the whole unfathomable caboodle that keeps us alive. What price is a cloud I wonder. Is it worth more if it’s rain-filled? On the European Union website for example, there’s a page headed, ‘Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services’, describing ‘an EU-wide methodology to map, assess and achieve good condition of ecosystems so they can deliver benefits such as climate regulation, water regulation, soil health, pollination and disaster prevention”. Even in the make-believe world where you could put a price on bees pollinating crops, or billions of worms, bacteria and beetles recycling vital nutrients by decomposing dead plants and animals, or the 100 million tons of carbon dioxide which NASA estimates ocean phytoplankton draw from the atmosphere every day – whose would that service be to trade or exchange? ‘Ecosystem services’ reduces the immeasurable, the complex, intricate, astonishing and mysterious workings of nature to some useful tasks carried out for our benefit, akin to a job well done by a plumber or an accountant. It’s a phrase better suited to the lexicon of the pre-Copernican age, to the distant past, when we were led to believe that humankind is at the centre of the universe and that nature is here only to furnish our needs. I’ve listened to advocates of the natural capital and ecosystem services approach. They insist this is the best route to take towards environmental salvation. I want to be optimistic, but when I consider who is propagating this type of terminology I can’t help but be sceptical. Governments, industries, and the financial sector have much to gain when nature is commodified and traded, and not only in monetary terms. Previously uninterested in nature or conservation, pension funds and other financial institutions, oil and gas companies, airlines, construction companies, venture capitalists, commodity traders, business entrepreneurs, and so forth, now jostle to be seen to be greener. Can we believe that the same forces which have for so many decades emitted millions of tons of CO₂ into the atmosphere and exploited the natural world for profit, frequently destroying wild habitats in the process, have made a remarkable U-turn in their principles and their ambitions? Is this really about safeguarding nature? Or, does remodelled nature-jargon, favoured by international agencies, businesses, and government departments disguise their true objectives? Photo by Flo Mader, Pixabay It’s easy to fall into the flawed language trap when these terms are commonplace. I’ve done it myself. I wrote a book and called it Future Sea: How to rescue and protect the world’s oceans, even though I know that none of us can rescue an ocean. Neither can we really protect an ocean. Protect it from what? From ourselves, it seems. There’s the paradox. When travelling with babies and children for instance, or storing Ming vases and Renaissance paintings, ‘protection’ means bundling precious things up in blankets or bubble-wrap, cocooning them in over-sized SUVs or wooden crates, to be kept safe from potential harm. When it comes to nature, in a sense, protection means the opposite – it is to leave something quite alone. The question is, can we come up with new words and fresh expressions, to energise the language of environmental policy-making, and in academia, journalism, and the media, to create a more nature-respectful and socially-just culture befitting the 21st century? ‘Ocean management’ could become ‘ocean use management’ perhaps; ‘natural capital’ is better called ‘the living world’, or ‘the natural world’; and ‘ecosystem services’ are ‘natural systems’, or ‘Earth’s life support systems'. Can you think of any language about the natural world to be challenged and improved? Or, any terms you’ll choose to boycott from now on? A term that has gained political traction, particularly in South America, is Buen Vivir. It loosely translates into English as ‘good living’, but the meaning is closer to ‘collective well-being’. Buen Vivir is a community-centric approach to life which prioritises living in harmony with nature and in many respects it embodies the antidote to terms like ‘natural capital’ and ‘ecosystem services’. The concept of Buen Vivir is enshrined in law in the constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia, countries which are taking the ‘radical step in reframing the place of humans in the world, one that many consider to be vital for the global transition to a more ecologically balanced future’. Mother and child in Guangaje, Ecuador, Azzedine Rouichi, Unsplash For many, the notion of putting a price on the priceless, such as breathable air, an intact ice-cap, an unpolluted river, or a pristine coral reef is misconceived, but as journalist George Monbiot writes in his article discussing natural capital, “still more deluded is the expectation that we can defend the living world through the mindset that’s destroying it” or, as Albert Einstein put it, “we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/04/15/global-newsletter-63/,"Rebels all over the world take part in global rebellions, including in Sierra Leone, Indonesia, Brazil and Italy. This issue: Global Scientist Rebellion | World Water Rebellion | Just Stop Oil UK | Dear rebels, Sometimes there is so much going on in our movement, trying to cover it all in one global newsletter can feel overwhelming. Right now is definitely one of those times. In the last month, XR groups have organised two Global Rebellions that have brought together thousands of rebels in hundreds of actions across more than 35 countries. The Global Scientist Rebellion and the World Water Rebellion represent amazing feats of rebel bravery, creativity, and coordination. Both feature an unprecedented balance of actions across the Global North and Global South, with every continent of this planet represented. You can read all about them in Action Highlights. Scientists participate in the Global Scientist Rebellion in (top left to bottom right) Rwanda, Washington DC, Switzerland, and Italy. If that wasn’t enough, we also have a report on a rebel campaign targeting UK oil infrastructure in the run up to XRUK’s April Rebellion. Rebels have teamed up with activists from Just Stop Oil to repeatedly disrupt multiple oil refineries. This exciting campaign demonstrates an escalation of tactics by rebels, and embodies XRUK’s new demand for their rebellion: that the government stop all further fossil fuel licensing and production. This explosion in global rebellion, together with new alliances and new levels of disruption in the place where rebellions began, shows a heartening evolution of our movement. But it also shows an increasing desperation at the stagnation in our geopolitics. For World Water Rebellion, rebels toast the water management company in Rosario, Argentina, which ignores sewage pollution. Their banners: “We're up to here in shit”. This month saw the release of the third and final IPCC report, its focus on ways to reduce emissions. Fearing that governments would waterdown its findings to continue business as usual, Scientist Rebellion leaked an early version last summer. Tragically, their fears have proven to be correct. Despite the most pressing, well-informed, and dire warnings, despite countless protests all over the globe and scientists being arrested enmasse, our leaders still seem unable to put anything or anyone before Big Oil and capitalism. So the Rebellions must go on, and they must grow even bigger and bolder and more beautiful than they are today. Rest assured, this newsletter team will take some deep breaths, and then keep reporting on the very best of it. Get involved in XR wherever you are!

Support the Rebellion 4 - 9 APRIL | Worldwide Scientist Rebellion pour fake blood over the Spanish parliament in Madrid. It led to the largest simultaneous arrest of scientists ever recorded. Scientist Rebellion has launched another week of global civil disobedience, and it proved to be the largest protest by scientists in history. Over 1000 of them took part in actions across more than 28 different countries, and that was just on one day! Organisers described the campaign as an “embarrassment of riches” with too many actions and rebel scientist contributions to count. What was particularly exciting was the geographical range of the rebellion, with scientists from across Africa and South America joining their Global North colleagues to declare 1.5°C dead, and demand a climate revolution! In Malawi, following a teach-in at Lilongwe University, a letter was delivered to the nation’s president demanding a scientific approach to climate policy. Scientists threw fake oil over the Shell HQ in London, chained themselves to the White House in Washington DC, pasted scientific papers onto the Ministry of Transport in Berlin, rallied in front of the Ecuadorian Ministry for the Environment in Quito, held teach-ins in Sierra Leone, and marched through the streets of Uganda and the campuses of Nigeria. These disruptive actions led to numerous arrests, including a NASA scientist who chained himself to a Chase Bank in Los Angeles, a 77 year old professor who blocked a highway in Sydney, and the 53 scientists who threw fake blood onto the National Congress building in Madrid, which is likely to be the most scientists ever arrested simultaneously during a protest. Ecuadorian rebel scientists pasted articles and held a rally outside the Ministry of the Environment in Quito. Scientist Rebellion was founded in 2020 when two physicists threw paint over the Royal Society in London, the oldest scientific institution in the world, and called on scientists to engage in civil disobedience. As this rebellion has made clear, it has grown into a powerful international movement over the last two years.

XR groups around the world staged a week of water-themed protests to coincide with World Water Day and The World Water Forum, a major summit that brings together governments, businesses, NGOs and other organisations to increase access to clean water and sanitation. Today, water scarcity affects around 40% of the world's population and, according to the UN and World Bank, droughts could displace 700 million people by 2030. The Word Water Forum took place in the Sénégalese capital Dakar, and XR Sénégal invited rebels across Africa to join them there and take part in actions throughout the week-long summit. Speakers from XR Senegal and XR DRC debate Africa’s water security (above). Rebels from Senegal, Gambia, Uganda, South Africa and Rwanda outside the World Water Forum in Dakar (below). Together, they organised a citizens' assembly, spoke to locals struggling with water scarcity, and held a street protest demanding access to water for all. They also called out the World Water Forum for making empty promises, and prioritising the needs of corporations over local people in their efforts to find solutions. One rebel spoke about the situation in Kinshasa-Congo where children regularly die of waterborne diseases, and many people lack access to drinking water, despite having received millions of dollars to improve the situation from the World Bank. He demanded that African leaders be assessed first before being given more funds. XR Cameroon teamed up with ‘Green and Better World’ to educate students in Limbe about an ongoing cholera outbreak. The water-borne disease (long eradicated in the West) is leading many in the country to hospitalisation and death.

Many locals use polluted water because clean sources are too far away, and they cannot afford to buy commercial water. Many wells also dry up in summer, a problem exacerbated by the region’s rising temperatures. In Johannesburg, rebels protested outside the head office of a coal mining company which recently caused an acid mine spill, while in Cape Town they held a celebratory ceremony in the Liesbeek River after the indigenous San and Khoi peoples won a court case stopping the corporation Amazon from building on the river’s floodplain. Dehydrated rebels in Mar Del Plata, Argentina, nearly ‘die’ of thirst. Meanwhile piranhas in Buenos Aires try to devour the fence of the Government House. Under the banner ‘Aguas en Rebedía’ (Waters in Rebellion) actions were also launched by rebels across South America, a region where water has been privatised and polluted by global corporations to a staggering degree. In Mexico, rebels denounced the theft of community wells by water company Bonafont, and the eviction of indigenous activists who reclaimed one of their water bottling plants. Argentinian rebels became a shoal of piranhas as they protested the lethal cocktail of agrochemical contamination, sewage spillage, and global heating that is polluting their waterways and causing them to run at historic low levels. Rebels in Lima, Peru protest against the Ariana mining project which threatens the city’s water supply. Peruvian rebels demanded action by Repsol for the devastating oil spill still plaguing its coastline. They also denounced the Ariana mining project, which threatens to contaminate Lima’s main source of water, which is used by more than 10 million people.

APRIL | UK Rebels have allied with activists from the new group Just Stop Oil (JSO) to blockade oil facilities across the UK. The series of actions were launched in the week before a nationwide April Rebellion, and demonstrate the new demand that XRUK and JSO are making to their government: halt all new fossil fuel licensing and production. XRUK and JSO have repeatedly disrupted more than ten oil facilities, blocking entrances, locking-on to structures, hiding in secretly constructed tunnels, and clambering atop oil trucks. Rebels & JSO activists start blockading oil terminals on Fossil Fools Day (April 1st). Directly targeting oil infrastructure represents an escalation of disruptive tactics by our movement. But with the latest instalment of the IPCC report warning that 1.5°C will be out of reach without immediate reduction in fossil fuel use, both XRUK and JSO have pledged to continue targeting the industry until the government agrees to stop the 40 new oil and gas licences that are planned before 2030, and ends the fossil fuel economy as a whole. JSO was mobilised by the Youth Climate Swarm, a collection of non-violent activists for people aged up to 30, meaning the group is youth-led. A JSO supporter says: “it’s really important that youth are at the forefront, because we are the ones who are going to suffer if these oil licences do get signed.” While rebels scaled bamboo tripods and oil tankers, JSO activists scuttled down secret tunnels and locked themselves to oil pipes and roof rafters. Many of JSO’s activists have links to XR and Insulate Britain, but this is the first time that the groups have united. While XR’s tenets lie in civil disobedience, JSO has defined their strategy as civil resistance. Our JSO supporter describes civil resistance as a shift from asking the government for action, to making demands happen through direct action: “I’ve been part of many campaigns that ask things of the government – and we’re still doing that now, but we’re also using our bodies to actively stop oil. We can’t wait around for the government to act.” A key action targeted the Navigator oil terminal, a distribution centre responsible for about 50% of vehicle fuels in the southeast of England. Using a technique called “tanker surfing,” rebels sat on oil tankers that transport fuel across the country day and night. Rebels have also locked on to pipes and refinery structures. JSO’s Australian branch (Just Stop It) were simultaneously blockading the Exxon Mobil terminal in Yarraville (top) and Exxon Mobil’s Melbourne HQ (above). Top photos: Matt Hrkac. For news of JSO’s Norwegian branch check out Newsletter XTRA. The Navigator terminal was successfully blocked for 36 hours, with the first rebel only removed after 12 hours. In the following days, police presence escalated, with a national response bringing hundreds of officers to oil terminals across the country. Ten days into the campaign, JSO reported 800 arrests. Despite this, the government has not responded, and mainstream media has failed to make clear the link between the actions and rising fuel shortages in the region. As the April Rebellion launches, disruption to the UK’s oil and gas economy will continue. Be sure to check out the full report next issue, and learn more about JSO by visiting their website and following them on social media. 22 MARCH | Makassar, Indonesia Rebels blockade a major city road to protest against the privatisation of water. 22 MARCH | Johannesburg, South Africa Activists do the water salute during a protest outside a local coal mining company’s headquarters. 22 MARCH | Rutshuru, DRC XR Rutshuru mobilised in a makeshift camp for 1,000 displaced people in eastern DRC, where access to drinking water is a major issue. They called on the state as well as the international community to take urgent measures. 22 MARCH | Jigawa, Nigeria XR Muslims organised a water awareness event at a school in North West Nigeria, where groundwater is the only source of water. 22 MARCH | Berlin, Germany XR Germany blockaded the new Tesla Gigafactory for electric cars because of its vast water consumption in a drinking water protection area. 22 MARCH | Belgrade, Serbia Rebels publicised the dirty water from Zrenjaninska, denouncing that the city hasn’t had drinkable water for 18 years, a fate that could await other Serbians if several construction projects go ahead in the region, most notably the Rio Tinto mines in Loznica that we reported on in a past issue. 22 MARCH | Santander, Colombia Young activists say no to fracking. A pilot fracking project will soon start, despite widespread protest. The Magdalena river, the livelihoods of millions, and the lives of activists who speak out are at risk. So many rebel actions happened this month we couldn’t fit them into five newsletters, let alone one.

Co-presenter Nuala Lam, a veteran of the XRUK Media and Messaging team, also discusses the strategy behind the upcoming April Rebellion. Listen to the XR Podcast here. Overstory does not, at first, seem like a novel about climate change. We’re not sure it’s even a novel. But oh, wow! It starts as seven apparently unrelated stories that then merge into a sprawling tale about radical environmental activism in the 1980’s. Then the stories separate out again and finally the book ends, but with no clear resolution. This isn't the arc-shaped plot we’ve been taught novels should have. Instead, it’s a tree. It’s also beautifully-written fiction incredibly dense with scientific and historical fact. That there really were fish living in pools up in redwood canopies, and liquid mace really was dripped in the eyes of locked-down activists, is heart-rending. Overstory covers issues closely related to climate change, but there’s another reason we’re recommending it. Humans easily get so preoccupied with ourselves that we forget how to notice each other, never mind the rest of the world—and we know where that preoccupation leads. But the brilliance of Overstory is that it denies preoccupation. Its very refusal to play by the rules of normal human discourse, is its refusal to look away from the existence of the more-than-human. It is an escape hatch from solipsism, a call to unsuicide.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/04/03/solarpunk-giants-will-stand/,"The XR Wordsmiths' Solarpunk Storytelling Showcase is Extinction Rebellion’s first global short story contest for all ages. The project rides the wave of the Solarpunk movement and grew from the belief that imagining a better future is the first step towards creating it. The power of collective and radical imagination helps to inspire action against unjust, destructive futures by actively building towards the future we want to see. The following story - Where Giants Will Stand - was one of three winners in the 19 & Over category, and was written by Spencer R. Scott. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Cora and Rosa caught me in the garden. They rode their bikes under the arched passion fruit vines and into our driveway. I had just finished pruning the tomatoes, knees achy, I welcomed their timing. “Hi grandpa!” Rosa yelled as she raced past the Olive guild and the perfumed Loquats. “Happy birthday my sweet child!” She laid her bike down, hopped a garden bed and smothered me. “Your grandpop and I made you a present,” I whispered conspiratorially in her ear. She pulled back from the hug expectantly, eyes wide, “is it for my collection?” I nodded. Every year we made a different species to awe her with. Last year was a sabertooth cat made of bio-printed ivory. “The Smilodon californicus had teeth 7 inches long and once prowled these very lands.” She had been incredulous. “Nuh-uh”. She spent the summer at the library, nose buried in North American Megafauna. “Go run inside and get your present, grandpop is finishing wrapping it.” “Okay! But grandpa guess what?” Before I could venture a guess, my daughter had reached the garden, “we measured her grove this morning,” Cora said, raising her eyebrows. It is customary in Arëgrostent to plant a small grove of Coastal Redwoods when a child is born. Her grove was out by the sea, slowly reclaiming ancient Sequoia territory from the reign of bovine pastureland. Rosa and her grove were 9 years old today. “Grandpa, the tallest tree in my grove just passed five meters!” “Wow! You must be taking great care of them,” I beamed. She shrugged shyly. Of course she was. Grandpop had finished concealing the present and brought it out to the garden. “Why don’t you open it! But be careful,” he warned with an impish smile. She unwrapped the cloth and opened the box, gingerly revealing an opalescent spike ball the size of her head. “It’s spikey!” “It’s called a radiolaria. It’s a teeny, tiny sea creature that lives inside a mineral skeleton,” he explained. Its structure was somewhere between a Victorian chandelier and a gazebo made of sea urchins. “Grandpa, how does it shine in all the colors?” Whit gave us abalone shells from his last harvest and we fed them into the bio-printer. “Isn’t it wonderful? Abalone shells are made of tiny little blocks all stacked on top of eachother like a maze. You know how sunlight is secretly made of all the colors of the rainbow, but when they’re all together you can’t make out any of the individuals?” “Yeah, I remember.” “Well, when light enters the maze of the shells, some of the colors get lost and separated from each other. Each color makes its way out at different times, so you get to see them all!” She narrowed her eyes and brought the radiolaria up to her face as close as she could. “Must be a tiny maze,” she concluded in wonder. … After breakfast, it was time for the big event. “Okay, sweetpea, your mom and I have decided it’s time you learn the meaning of our town’s name.” “Mama said you named it.” “We all named it, together. I just suggested it. Somehow it stuck, even though it was a hack job of Latin.” “What does it mean?” “I’ll tell you after we visit the sacred grove.” “I finally get to go to the sacred grove!?” “Hmm…. perhaps, if you can name our three sacred callings?” She stood at attention and recited, “To tend the forest, to hydrate the land, to guide the waters.” “How do we conduct the Four Tendings?” “With fire, with pruning, with nourishment, with planting.” “Very good, and what are the Four Hydrations?” “River, Rain, Groundwater, and Fog.” “And what are the Four Guides to water-tending?” “Slow it, spread it, sink it, store it!” We are the people of fire, drought, and flood. Every member of our Watershed knew the mantras, our survival depended on it. But Rosa was born in the cradle of a new era, where survival seemed obvious. She was born to the first generation in decades to not be plagued by the constant threat of war, disaster, and scarcity. Rosa did not know the bleeding of the world. She hadn’t known the dread that clipped at our heels during the decades of the Great Transformation. She had not seen the hills crowned in insatiable blazes year after year. Her skies had never been as orange as a persimmon, she had never choked on the ashes of her neighbors she could not save. She had never seen her home, the cumulation of all her memories, wash away in a superstorm. She had never known the heartache of the water shutting off, nor the hopelessness of watching your crops, day by day, mummify in the summer heat. She hadn’t known the hunger, nor the fear, nor the grit. Rosa was born in the year of Drawdown, the year carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had begun decreasing for the first time in centuries. Every year of her life has been milder than the last. Until we welcomed her smiling face in the world, every year of ours had been worse. Each successive year hardening us, challenging us, changing us. We were molded into the people we needed to be. Rosa was something else. Rosa was a child of abundance. During the year of Drawdown, after a long season of celebration, the elders of the watershed convened. We were weary but we understood vigilance was the price of safety. Having studied the cycles of humanity, we worried about this next generation. Who would these children who may only ever know abundance be? What forces did they have to keep them in right relationship to land? Would they grow complacent? Would they stay true to the three sacred callings? We decided to construct three temples to remind our children what sustains us, and with each temple a ritual to indebt the heart to their sacredness. “Final question. Rosa, what do the three temples help us remember?” “The Cove of the Fog, to remember the gifts of the ocean. The Temple of the Headwaters, to remember that without water there is no life. And the Grove of the Ancients, to remember our legacy is the land.” …. It was a long ride to the grove. It’s what brought my husband and I here to begin with all those years ago. Of course, it almost burnt to the ground the year we moved, and many years since. But there it still stood, through luck and the power of community, the most southern grove of old-growth Sequoias remained regal in its creekbed. We parked our bikes a mile from the grove. I held Rosa’s hand the whole walk there as she skipped and squirmed, but as we drew closer she steadied into a slink. The Grove can have that effect. We walked through the gate, and Rosa was stunned. She had never seen trees so large or so old. Many of the trees in the watershed were nearly as tall, but none even half as thick. We decided in that meeting long ago, that nine was the right age to introduce our children to the grove. It was deemed an impressionable age, and an age at which a child begins to set the stage for their life’s direction. She walked in a daze, naturally drawn to the oldest tree in the grove as if by spiritual gravity. She placed her hand on its rusty bark and lulled her head back in reverse vertigo. “How old is she, grandpa?” “One thousand, five hundred years old.” She thought about it for a moment before simply letting out a “Woah.” She wanted to know more, “Does she have a name?” “She did once. But we no longer name individual trees, the unit of a forest is a grove.” “Well, what was her name before?” “Colonel Armstrong” She scrunched her face, “That’s a silly name. Who was that?” “Rosa, do you know why we don’t name beings or places after people anymore?” She shrugged. “Because places and beings don’t belong to us. It is us who are indebted to them.” “But what about people who are really, really good?” “Even them.” “Why don’t we want to remember them?” “Because people will run around all day trying to figure out what will make them commemorated. Because no one ever does anything alone, the unit of a forest is a grove. Because we have to remember we are not immortal, and that no plaque or street or tree with our name on it will change that.” “Our legacy is the land,” she repeated softly. Something clicked in her, “Did Arëgrostent used to be named after someone?” “Yes.” I momentarily dodged the question, “It’s first name was Ceola. It meant: the shady place. This land was so dense with ancient trees, the Pomo people only visited in the summer when they needed to cool off. Then the Europeans came and gave it a different name.” “And named it after someone?” “Yup, they called it Guerneville. It was named after a Swiss man.” “Why’d they name it after him?” “Because he owned the sawmill in town.” “What do you mean?” Most of our lumber came from the bio-printer these days, it could grow any shape of wood from a brick of compost. We pruned our trees and the microbes in the printer turned our clippings into lumber. We had little use for a sawmill outside the occasional wind-felled tree. “They named it after him because he made the most money cutting down the most ancient trees.” “You mean one’s like these?” She flailed her arm in an arc. “Even bigger ones. Older ones.” I said softly. “They cut down so many trees that for years our home was just known as Stumptown.” She looked about on the verge of tears. Sometimes the heart was like a bone, you had to break it to set it right. “You can cry, sweetheart. But just know, we won’t let that happen again.” She stared off into the distance, letting her tears flow bravely. “You want to know what Arëgrostent means?” She looked up at me hopefully. Her eyes were two twinkling stars. “We thought about calling it Arëgrosted-Arëgrostent, but it was too much of a mouthful. We settled on just Arëgrostent. “What does Arëgrosted mean, grandpa?” “Where giants stood.” “What about Arëgrostent?” I held her hand a little tighter. “Where giants will stand.” share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/03/22/palestine-colonialism-global-climate-justice/,"The climate and ecological emergency (CEE) touches every corner of the globe, affecting the lives of each and every one of us. We are truly in this together. However, some of us are being hit harder, sooner. Climate breakdown affects populations differently depending on a number of geographical and socio-political factors. Those effects are also deeply rooted in historic and systemic inequalities which are reproduced and deepened further through the CEE, creating an extreme and vicious cycle. It sounds like a mouthful, but let’s break down some of the terms in that first paragraph to make sure we’re all on the same page. When social attitudes and political policies or practices interact, they can be labelled ‘socio-political factors’. One example is violence against women: this takes many forms and happens around the world because of differing negative social attitudes towards girls and women. It continues, in part, because laws either do not protect women from violence, or in some cases, punish them for it. We see the product of society’s attitude towards women’s safety reflected in political policies when we learn that in 1990, only four countries in the world had laws protecting women from violence. The second term, ‘systemic inequality’ (similar to ‘structural inequality’), refers to factors of inequality built into the social and political systems that shape our lives, such as healthcare access, food security, education, housing, and employment. These systems are often experienced differently based on race and/or economic status. Understanding that these structures underpin the lived experiences of all of us allows us to see events through a ‘justice lens.’ This can (and should) also be applied to the climate and ecological emergency, leading us to understand people’s experiences with the CEE as issues of climate or environmental justice. All visuals are Creative Commons licensed and are found at visualizingpalestine.org. The visuals in Arabic are at the end of the article. The terms 'climate justice' and 'environmental justice' are used interchangeably, but 'environmental justice' came first, rooted in the experiences of marginalised black communities fighting back against their neighbourhoods being used as a dumping ground for toxic waste. 'Climate justice' is a newer term and relates to specific injustices linked to the rapidly accelerating climate crisis, but is also linked to the growth of climate-specific social movements in the 21st century and an understanding of climate injustices as truly transboundary, international issues that demand international solidarity. Looking critically at different communities’ experiences with climate breakdown, local, regional, and global patterns emerge. Geographically, we can see a different impact on those living in the Global North versus people living in the Global South; and similarly, in both richer countries and poorer countries, we see different impacts being felt between those who are well off and the poor. We also see that there is a different experience between genders with climate breakdown, with women bearing a disproportionate burden, and that the CEE makes life even harder for people in conflict-afflicted areas. Here, we zoom in on the climate and ecological emergency in Palestine, explained through infographics produced by Visualizing Palestine. We look at Palestinians’ experiences with colonization and climate breakdown, and see how they relate to experiences of other oppressed and marginalized peoples around the world. The state of Israel was established in 1948, ethnically cleansing, dispossessing, and displacing indigenous Palestinians from their homes. Since its inception, Israel’s rule over Palestinian life has morphed into a Kafkaesque, labirynthian web of control, geographically and socially fragmenting Palestinians from one another. Enduring over 70 years of colonization and living under apartheid has made Palestinians a particularly vulnerable group, especially when contrasted with their colonizer, Israel. While they share the same landscape, Israelis’ and Palestinians’ experiences with political autonomy, climate adaptation, and control over resources are vastly unequal, leaving Palestinians’ hands tied with how successfully they can tackle climate breakdown. Similarly, across the world, populations and communities who are marginalized due to age, gender, race, citizenship status, ethnicity, or economic ability may be more climate vulnerable than others. In Europe, we see this in the high number of elderly people who die during heat waves. In the US, communities of color experience greater climate vulnerability due to systemic inequalities. We see Black Americans’ vulnerability laid bare in the face of toxic wildfire smoke, and the disproportionate devastation they experienced during Hurricane Katrina, which was then reinforced by government ‘rebuilding’ programs after the storm. These experiences reinforce the disadvantages already faced by these communities. Writing about Katrina and subsequent storms, Professor Andy Horowitz reminds us: The wind isn’t racist, and the rain doesn’t target the poor. But when hurricanes strike and cities flood, people who were already disadvantaged tend to suffer the most. That’s because the wind and rain alone do not define the shape of our modern disasters[...] There have been calls not to ‘politicize’ the recent storms […b]ut rather than closing our eyes to the political decisions that shape our communities, we should open them wide. A disaster without politics would be an event without a history, a catastrophe without a cause. Let’s be clear: the climate and ecological emergency is a disaster, one with unique, dynamic events (such as Hurricane Katrina) occurring within it. Pacific Island nations are particularly vulnerable to the climate and ecological emergency, with many threatened to be underwater with rising ocean waters. Around the world, the climate crisis is already displacing millions, forcing them to leave their homes and seek refuge elsewhere. We, not the rain, have shaped this disaster and people’s vulnerability to it. The term ‘green colonialism’ refers to the greening or conservation of land at the expense of indigenous populations. This might take the form of building a national park on indigenous land or restricting access to green spaces for conservation efforts, and is deeply rooted in the ‘othering’ of poor communities, indigenous peoples, and people of color. This enables those in power (whether national governments or colonizing powers) to disregard the rights of these marginalized communities, because, as Naomi Klein points out, “... rights are meaningless when the land is desecrated.” Othering allows ‘national sacrifice areas’, and, in turn, dictates the people whose land and lives will be sacrificed. In Palestine, green colonialism has been central to Israel’s ethnic cleansing of Palestinian society, cheerily embodied in the catchy slogan that it will ‘make the desert bloom,’ while nefariously masking land seizures and displacements of Palestinian communities. Among other practices, Zionist organizations heralded themselves as ecological experts by covering Palestine with European pine trees, replacing indigenous trees and covering their destruction of Palestinian villages. This made the land more familiar and ‘homelike’ for Jewish European settlers and made it more difficult for Palestinian refugees to return. Digging its heels into the erasure of Palestinian life and charging on with its plan of a European vista, Israel sidelined indigenous Palestinian knowledge and banned black goats in 1950, a move which has accelerated the wildfires in Israel today. Shrouded in promises of ‘carbon off-setting,’ ‘making the desert bloom,’ and conservation, green colonization is perhaps one of the most hidden symptoms of both colonialism and climate injustice. Carbon off-setting may be an unfortunate necessity in the context of continually rising emissions levels, yet it often comes at the expense of Indigenous communities’ access to land. While land conservation is critical to the restoration of our living earth, it must be done in partnership with (or better yet, led by) Indigenous communities, rather than severing their relationship with the land, as was perpetrated against Native Americans in what is now Yellowstone National Park, or as is happening now with the Maasai tribe in Tanzania. Government and corporate powers often take liberties dumping their toxic waste into poor or minority communities. The comparison of who has clean water and who doesn’t is sometimes as stark as which side of the line you live on. In Orosi, California, it’s the east side of town whose water is poisoned by agricultural waste runoff, and children have to bathe with their mouths closed so they don’t accidentally swallow the water. East Orosi’s contamination is consistent with the fact that “water systems serving Latino communities have twice as many strikes against them for drinking water violations as the national average.” In poor areas such as Griswold, Iowa, there’s no budget for cleaning up the water, similarly poisoned by agricultural runoff because, as one city councilor bluntly states, “We have many more needs than we have money.” The national rich-poor divide is mirrored between countries in the Global North and those of the Global South. In the 1980s and 1990s, European companies dumped industrial toxins on the Somali coastline, a move belying how completely inconsequential they viewed Somali lives to be. Today, Kenya (like many countries in the Global South) faces a literal mountain of a problem with the Global North dumping its plastic and other waste there. Again, this can only happen in communities that are viewed as ‘lesser than’ or ‘ok to be sacrificed’ because, as one North Carolinian activist bluntly acknowledged, “they chose us because we were rural and poor and thought we couldn’t fight it.” These predatory practices target weaker communities. Israel routinely dumps its waste in occupied Palestine, where Palestinians desperate for a means of income burn plastic waste creating carcinogenic emissions, contributing to the increasing levels of cancer among Palestinians. Israel’s decades old blockade of the Gaza Strip—coupled with its repeated bombings of its electricity plants—has left only three percent of water drinkable, creating an unimaginable health crisis for Palestinians living in an unlivable place. In a colonial expression of supreme indifference, Israel then routinely denies Palestinians permits to enter Israel to treat their illnesses. Again we are reminded just how ‘disposable’ and ‘sacrificial’ some lives are seen to be. Being the insatiable leviathan it is, colonial forces target natural resources for their own capital gain, extracting them with reckless disregard for either the earth’s regeneration or Indigenous benefit. Here we should pause to be clear: humans have always used the earth’s resources, however ‘colonial extractivism’ brings with it capitalism’s ethos of domination over nature and indifference to human wellbeing. Its ‘winner takes all’ mantra sets it apart from a more balanced, regenerative approach to use of the earth’s resources. Colonial extraction is harmful in several ways. Let’s take the example of Congo, first snatched by King Leopold of Belgium in 1885. The Belgian king quickly discovered rubber trees’ money-making potential and set his colonial soldiers to work overseeing the collection of rubber and wreaking an unimaginable brutality upon the Congolese human beings he had reduced to cogs in his resource-extracting-machine. He not only cut them out of any profit he was making, he cut them up as well. But he was making money and Brussels was beautifying itself with this inundation of wealth, and others wanted to get in on the rubber boom. Rubber (and Indigenous people) were exploited in Peru and, once that tap dried up, Europeans cleared large swathes of native trees in South East Asia, replacing them with rubber producing trees to keep up with European and American demand for tires and the burgeoning automobile industry. And you’ll never guess what natural resource was next up on the list for mass extraction at the expense of Indigenous and local communities…but we’ll leave oil alone, for now… The devastating human and environmental cost of colonial extractivism still reverberates and continues today. Colonialism actively de-developed and impoverished resource-rich areas around the world, a legacy with which they are still grappling. This destructive extraction is also carried out by governments and corporations who plunder resources from poorer areas within their own nations, without then reinvesting profits into those communities. This has been the story of Appalachia, one of the poorest areas in North America which was pillaged for coal. Like Appalachians, Congolese, and Indigenous communities in Europe’s Asian colonies, Palestinians also watch their natural resources being exploited for someone else’s profit. Is your head spinning? Does your heart hurt a bit and do you feel a slight knot in your stomach? Me too. And I’ve only written about it, I haven’t directly experienced any of this. Rather than retreat into a cloak of sadness or be paralyzed by guilt and the breadth of injustices in the world, we must rise up in solidarity and action. The infographics above give us a glimpse into the layered history and realities of Israel’s colonization of Palestinian land and lives. They help us understand that environmental degredation and the resulting vulnerability of Palestinian communities is one of the pillars of Israel’s colonization of Palestine, and colonialism at large. Once we approach it in this frame of mind, we see that the CEE is an issue of justice. This is where solidarity begins. The world is often presented superficially and with the privilege of distance, meaning that things just ‘are as they are.’ Poverty just exists. Bad health outcomes just happen. Food shortages just appear. But these phenomena do not exist in a vacuum; they are the product of history (which we know is often written by the ‘winner’ and leaves out all his dirty work) and the systems we have created and perpetuate. Remember the quote from the beginning of this article? “A disaster without politics would be an event without a history, a catastrophe without a cause.” We must understand history to know where we are going, and just as we have created destructive, toxic systems, we can rediscover, reimagine, and reinstate regenerative systems that grow a more just and equal world. The climate crisis is not simply a matter of science, it is a matter of justice. We are all in this together. We must stand shoulder to shoulder against the climate and ecological emergency, but also the injustice it brings with it. By understanding that our outcomes are intertwined and that we have an obligation to one another—both as human beings and in redressing historic wrongs—we may become allies to other communities around us. This means providing space for Indigenous and marginalized narratives. This means respectfully listening to their experiences as truths and not as personal attacks (which they are not). This means making sure Indigenous peoples’ knowledge is recognized, respected, and their expertise sought. This means questioning mainstream narratives that encourage ‘othering’ and making an active effort to read and seek out voices from the Global South and other marginalized communities. This means raising your voice and navigating conversations about the CEE towards an angle of justice. Make sure when you are demanding solutions to the climate and ecological emergency that they incorporate elements of justice. This means investing in communities who suffer disproportionate health hazards as a result of the crisis, whose greenspaces have been dismembered from them, whose natural resources are privatized with social and material benefits diverted away from them. This means demanding a restructuring of systems built to benefit some rather than all. This means demanding a dismantling of occupation, colonization, and militarization in Palestine—and elsewhere in the world. This means when you write a letter to, or take direct action against Shell to stop their growing extraction of fossil fuels for example, also demand restitution to the Indigenous communities they have dispossessed in the process, and about their plans for earth regeneration. I know this sounds like a lot. It is. We have big messes to clean up, but we can do it. We must remove ourselves from powers that support fossil fuels and indirectly sideline Indigenous rights. We must alter our lives away from fossil fuels and gas which bankroll militarization and war, as we are currently witnessing in Ukraine. We must hear and amplify calls for climate justice. The good news is that there are increasingly accessible options to live away from oil and gas, and marginalized voices are (finally, sometimes) being permitted entrance into the mainstream. None of us can do it alone, which is why we must tell the whole truth, come together, and act now. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/03/18/global-newsletter-62/,"Women gather in Cape Town, South Africa for the Women’s Climate Strike. In this issue: Women’s Climate Strike | A Letter From XR Ukraine | New IPCC Report Dear rebels, Disparities in wealth and lifestyle on our planet can be stark, and women from different parts of the world might hardly share a lived experience at all. Yet women are consistently affected more by climate change than men, particularly in the global south. Study after study has shown that women are more likely to be displaced by and even die in climate related disasters. The reasons for this are many, and further explored in Must Reads, but generally speaking it is because women have less power in society, and earn less money. Women are often the primary providers of food, water, and care for their families. This work is vital for society to function, yet it is not valued by economies shaped by centuries of patriarchy. A group of women climate activists in Glossop, England were tired of seeing women overlooked at climate conferences and underrepresented across global politics. They started forging links with women activists around the world, learning about their different experiences, and planning a global action for International Women’s Day. The Women’s Climate Strike was the rebellious result, and you can read all about it in Action Highlights. BINDU, a feminist organisation in Bangladesh, took part in the Women’s Climate Strike. There you can also find out what XR Ukraine wants us to do to help stop the Russian war machine. It has been disconcerting watching the Western media fascinate over this war while ignoring war crimes elsewhere. But the blanket coverage has highlighted how oil and gas finances war, and will hopefully make demands to quit fossil fuels more widespread. The media’s focus on Ukraine certainly reduced the impact of the new IPCC report, the subject of our final story this month. The chilling assessment states that on our current trajectory, large swathes of land, chiefly in Africa, will become uninhabitable within decades. This month’s stories make clear that for our world to thrive, we must all strive to extend our solidarity outwards - beyond our direct neighbours, across continents, and across genders. We hope this issue of the newsletter plays a small part in doing that. XR Ukraine during more peaceful times at a rally in Kyiv, September 2021. Get involved in XR wherever you are!

Support the Rebellion 8 MARCH | Worldwide South African women rally at their parliament in Cape Town for the Women’s Climate Strike. To mark International Women’s Day, a grassroots network of women activists (including rebels) held a series of unique protests and community events around the world. The Women’s Climate Strike saw women protesting in front of their parliaments in London, Edinburgh and Cape Town, and launching actions from Bangladesh to Portugal that amplified women's voices and bridged women communities. XR Uganda visited Naposhi, a remote village in the Eastern Region, so the women there could speak directly about life on the frontline of the climate crisis. Their area has been devastated by landslides and floods after a decade of increasingly heavy rains. Women and children of Naposhi village, Uganda, take part in a Zoom meeting for the Women’s Climate Strike. With no local roads or electricity to rely on, Ugandan rebels brought a generator and laptop to set up a Zoom meeting. An international audience listened as the women gathered around the computer and gave harrowing accounts of a landslide that caused flood waters to wash away several local villages, killing 73 and displacing more than 1000 people. The cataclysmic event happened in 2019, but for the women it clearly felt like only yesterday. Many are still homeless, struggling with injuries, and mourning family members lost in the flood. They have received no help from their government, nor an opportunity to relocate to a safer area. The eye-opening event crystallised how many communities are one climate disaster away from long term devastation, and how the political imperative to adapt to the climate crisis is meaningless for those communities denied even basic state support. A 24hr vigil was held in front of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to commemorate women activists murdered for defending our planet. Inspired by Fridays For Future, the Women’s Climate Strike movement began as a weekly protest by women in Glossop, a small town in England. The group was tired of seeing women sidelined during climate conferences and across politics in general, and used regular Zoom meetings to build an international network of women activists. They framed their global day of action under the banner 'The Wait of the World' to highlight how women, particularly those living in the global south, bear the weight of the climate crisis, yet are also excluded from political processes and so left waiting for the world to act. 24 FEB | Ukraine Top: The first meeting of XR Ukraine & FFF Ukraine in November 2021. Bottom: One of the coordinators on a sleeper train, evacuating from Kharkiv to Kyiv in February 2022. “I was fighting against the Climate Crisis. Now I am fleeing a war caused by fossil fuels.” On the day that Russian tanks rolled into their country, XR Ukraine sent an open letter to other rebel groups, urging them to blockade the offices of Gazprom, Rosneft and other Russian companies that supply oil, gas and coal to the EU. The letter calls out EU governments, and Germany in particular, for their dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a main source of income for the Russian government, meaning they are directly funding the invasion of Ukraine. The EU, UK and US collectively spend more than $700m a day buying Russian oil and gas. This makes fossil fuels not only an existential threat to world ecology, but also to world peace. XR groups across Europe responded to the call, and the past weeks saw rebel solidarity actions outside Gazprom offices and fossil fuel infrastructure in Germany, Finland, France and the Netherlands. Red rebels at the Belgian port of Ghent. 6.2 million tons of Russian goods arrived there last year, including vast amounts of coal. Photo: Lieve Blancquaert. Russians have also been protesting against the war, and arrested in their thousands for it. State repression has become so bad that even children have been detained by police, and new laws could see peaceful anti-war protesters jailed for up to 15 years. XR Ukraine was founded in the summer of 2019 and is a small chapter, with a handful of core coordinators. They have worked closely with Friday’s For Future Ukraine on a number of actions, and recently shifted their main communication channel to Instagram.

The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has been released after seven years of work by thousands of climate scientists. And it’s terrifying stuff. Read this in-depth Q&A for a detailed yet accessible summary of the report’s findings. Focusing on the impacts of climate change and the capacities (and limits) of human adaptation, the UN report’s conclusions are dire. No inhabited region on Earth will escape the climate crisis. Half of the world’s population live in areas “highly vulnerable” to climate change. And the window to secure a “liveable future” is rapidly closing. The report made a noteworthy mention of ‘loss and damage’ - which refers to impacts of climate change that can't be adapted to, and which Global North governments refuse to acknowledge because it could lead to huge compensation payouts to the Global South. The endorsement by the IPCC will give vulnerable nations a boost in future climate talks. Police dismantle a giant 1.5° symbol during a rebel blockade of a Berlin bridge after the release of the IPCC report. The UN Secretary General called the report “a damning indictment of failed climate leadership”, stressing that “every second counts” in the race to slash emissions. Rebels around the world, armed with love and rage, took to the streets to make sure the public knew about this criminal abdication of leadership. Highlights include rebels in Berlin erecting a huge 1.5°sculpture on a central bridge (and proclaiming it dead) and rebels in Brussels going on an overnight poster campaign that saw ‘Delay Means Death’, a quote from UN Secretary General, appear all over the city. Left: A rebel at Bromma airport in Sweden gets arrested on the runway. Right: Rebels unveil a banner (Green flights do not exist) in Copenhagen’s Kastrup airport. 26 - 28 FEB | Sweden & Denmark Scandinavian rebels joined forces to launch one of the largest actions against the aviation industry, ever. XR Sweden organised a wave of airport actions across the country, while XR Denmark focused on Kastrup airport in Copenhagen. Their combined efforts resulted in seven airports being disrupted and six planes being grounded. While some rebels occupied planes or glued themselves to runways, others held die-ins and demonstrations in departure lounges. The rebels decided to announce their plans in advance, increasing the safety of the actions and ensuring that media coverage started early. Although the heightened security led to some rebels being stopped prematurely, the actions still had an immense impact on the airports. Scandinavian governments spend vast sums subsidising their aviation sectors, money that should be spent immediately mitigating the climate crisis. 11 FEBRUARY | Mar Del Plata, Argentina People power! Days after the Global Coastal Rebellion that saw an alliance of activists rise up to protect their oceans from extractivism, an Argentinian court suspended all oil exploration off the country’s coast.

The film was screened on International Women’s Day at the Human Screen Film Festival in Tunisia. Spotify: Sustainable Masculinities and DegrowthMen have played a key role in developing, benefiting from and upholding a global system that has exploited peoples and ecosystems all over the planet. This podcast asks a deceptively simple question: what does a non-exploitative type of masculinity look like? To put it another way, what should it mean to be ‘male’ in a post-capitalist, eco-feminist world? The original Animal, Vegetable, Miracle was a charming memoir about a family’s attempt to live on mostly locally-sourced food for a year. It includes lots of insightful, well-informed discussion of how and why, alongside family stories heart-warming and otherwise. That the primary author, the mother of the family, was already an accomplished and well-known novelist certainly helped give the book its voice and its reach—this memoir is one of several simultaneous (and independent) launch-points for what has become the localvore movement. The tenth anniversary edition (now itself five years old) adds new chapters from each family member, including those who were children last time around. So why recommend it here? And why now? Simply put, without fossil fuel, we will again depend mostly on local foods. Kingsolver and her family show us how that might work, and how it might be good. And since finding and preparing food is still, for better or worse, 'women’s work' in many families, this month is a great time to explore how such labour, at home, can be its own powerful form of rebellion. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops by buying your books at Bookshop or Hive. Sometimes people ask me, “Who do you work for?” I tell them that I work for the environment. Then they say, “Is there an organisation called ‘Environment’?” I’m not employed by anybody. Last year, I quit my job so I could find my purpose. The only thing I find joy in doing is serving the environment: going into jungles, planting trees, cleaning up beaches… I live in Dar es Salaam, one of the bigger cities in Tanzania and among the fastest growing in Africa. Most people at least know about climate change here. But when you go to other regions, people have no idea. People say they don’t see it, but it’s happening now. We’re supposed to have rains starting now, but so far only a few regions have rain. The most inspirational thing in my life is Mount Kilimanjaro. I call it “the fragile beauty”. If we don’t look after that mountain, we are all doomed, because it’s a big supply of drinking water to the Tanzanian population and of value to East Africa. If we don’t take care of the glaciers, they could melt away within the next few decades. According to the UN, we can reduce water shortages in East Africa by reforesting Mount Kilimanjaro. Mount Kilimanjaro also inspired me to come up with ‘Trees for Birthdays’. . If someone is turning 30, we plant 30 trees to help reforest the mountain; for someone turning 50, we plant 50 trees. I track the trees to make sure they grow to maturity. I wish everyone could do this – imagine a world where everyone planted trees on their birthday! I believe women are the most affected when it comes to climate change. A UN report said that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, their farms would increase yields by 20 to 30 percent, raising total agricultural output in developing countries 2.5 to 4 percent. If women don’t take responsibility right now, then future generations will be affected. As a woman, I feel that I have the responsibility to fight for inclusion.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/03/10/XR-Ukraine-Statement/,"This statement was written by XR Україна just before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia on the 24th February, 2022. It ends with a call to action from those who read the letter, which is highlighted here and followed by the rest of the statement in full: In the case of a full-scale Russian military invasion into Ukraine, XR Ukraine will not be able to communicate with XR Global and regional XR groups. XR Ukraine asks you to treat this message as a finalized version of our call to act. To act as soon as possible. ""The reason for this message from XR Ukraine is the escalation of Russian military aggression against Ukraine during recent days. In our message below, we want to highlight how the EU’s dependence on Russian coal, oil and gas, has created existential threats both for world peace and for the climate. The money coming from those sources is no less than crucial for Putin's criminal regime, which uses fossil-fuel money for his military aggression outside of Russia and for unprecedented in world history TV, radio, print and digital propaganda and brutal police control inside Russia. What climate policy can Germany and other European countries claim to have if they’ve been buying oil and gas from an international terrorist for decades? How can the climate crisis be solved when there is an energy security crisis at the heart of the EU? Even without a climate agenda, fossil fuels are a threat to world peace as they feed dictatorships all over the world. But Putin’s dictatorship is particularly outstanding. Here is why: a. The history of tension in the energy sector between Russia and Europe spans over 20 years. At the same time the prices of oil and gas have been crucial for the economy of Russia during this period. The money coming from coal, oil and gas exports gave Putin the opportunity to start military ventures outside of Russia, including but not limited to: invasion into Georgia in 2008, supporting Assad’s regime and escalating civil war in Syria in 2011, the annexation of Crimea in March of 2014, starting the proxy-war against Ukraine in April of 2014. The war has already lasted for almost 8 years and transformed into the full scale invasion of Eastern Ukraine on February 21 2022. b. To begin with, it’s worth recollecting facts about how Putin became President, what methods he used, and what can be concluded about the threats for Ukraine at the moment, and possibly to the stability of the world in the upcoming future. Before becoming a president Putin has worked in KGB (communist security agency responsible for the majority of repressions against people of USSR) and in Federal Security Service - FSS, the main successor agency to the Soviet Union’s KGB. c. Russian alcoholic president Yeltsin announced his resignation on 31 December 1999. Immediately after that, Putin had become Acting President of the Russian Federation. There were lots of attempts to disclose the true reasons for the resignation of Yeltsin, some sources concluded that it was due to the pressure on him from Russian military and secret service circles, including FSS. Putin won the first presidential elections due to the support from Yeltsin and his party, the support obtained under pressure. Putin's rating during the first term was declining, but after the Moscow theater hostage crisis (Nord-Ost) his rating skyrocketed. Anna Politkovskaya - the investigative journalist, who tried to investigate role of FSS in Nord-Ost tragedy, was murdered before she could publish her findings. Prior to that false-flag Russian apartment bombings in Moscow in 1999 led to the Second Chechen war. People of Russia had been constantly trained to vote in the atmosphere of fear. If Putin wants to increase his support inside the country - he creates fear: fears of terrorism inside Russia, fears of NATO and geopolitical instability of near Russian borders. d. In 2004-2005 there was the Orange Revolution in Ukraine - the act against anti-democratic presidential elections in Ukraine, which turned into the victory of democratic forces in Ukraine and defeat of Putin’s puppet - Victor Yanukovych. This revolution was dangerous for Putin - people in Russia shouldn’t be seeing democratic elections and protests in the neighboring post-Soviet state. As a measure to tame the development of democratic Ukraine Moscow used blackmail in the energy sector against Ukraine during so-called gas wars: Ukraine had been paying much higher prices for Russian gas and oil than other European states. e. Germany and the EU largely ignored the events mentioned above and together with Russia began the construction of North Stream 1. Putin’s regime has earned huge money thanks to this project in the last 10 years. And it’s on top of the gains from the fossil fuel export projects that existed before that. Money he obtained was not spent on making the life of an average Russian better, instead Putin’s regime has injected billions into the military sector and powerful propaganda inside and outside of Russia. That propaganda is comparable in its power to the propaganda of Hitler’s Third Reich, but surpasses it in the technical sophistication and extent of its coverage, including orchestrated manipulation of public opinion in digital media. f. In 2014, the Euromaiden Revolution took place in our country, which toppled the kleptocratic regime of Victor Yanukovych. Immediately after shootings of people in the Maidan central square by special forces and the flight of Yanukovych to Russia, the annexation of Crimea took place. Just in a few weeks with military support and funding from the Russian Federation, violent events unfolded in the east of the country. We all have friends or acquaintances from this region who were forced to leave their homes and flee from the war and lawlessness. The Western reaction was to impose limited sanctions, which did not affect the energy sector and the export of fossil fuels from Russia. Moreover, the construction of Nord Stream 2 began in 2018. g. The consequence of ignoring all of the above by the West is the energy blackmail and gas terror against the EU, which unfolded in the winter of 2021-2022. Putin also crushed democratic uprisings against dictators in the neighboring countries - Belarus and Kazakhstan. A large concentration of Russian troops now continue to be on the territory of Belarus. a. The world faces the threat of unimaginable destruction. The call for international solidarity is urgent as never before. Now with Ukraine, Putin is acting in the same way as Hitler did in 1939, when an extensive armed forces invasion followed a provocation on the border of Poland. But unlike Putin today, then Hitler didn’t have in possession nuclear weapons and largest reserves of fossil fuels. b. This week the shelling goes both towards Ukraine and to the occupied territories in order to create a pretext for a full-scale invasion. This is a matter of very limited time. Ukrainians are preparing for this as much as possible. The only way to stop the war is to block financial flows from the EU customers to the Russian oil and gas industry. Unfortunately, the sanctions imposed to date by the Western world, like temporarily blocking Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, offer very little to address the true cause of what is happening. c. If the Green New Deal agenda was established earlier and implemented in the EU at a faster pace, if the EU would have announced carbon neutrality by 2030, the massive problems that Europe faces today could naturally have been avoided. d. We believe that the threat of global war, which can potentially become nuclear, can be diverted if Gazprom, Rosneft and all oil and gas companies that actively cooperate with Putin's regime, are immediately deprived of financial resources and political influence. This will not only guarantee peace, but also enable achieving carbon neutrality faster and solve the climate crisis before it becomes unmanageable. a. Today we need an international public response against Putin’s regime at the global scale, which can only be paralleled with the response and measures taken against apartheid regime of South Africa in late 1980s but at deeper level and with universal coverage. b. We need to start global divestment from all fossil-based businesses that feed billions into escalation of two potentially planet-killing threats - Putin’s military machine and escalation of the climate crisis. c. Not only Russian energy companies like Gazprom and Rosneft, but also transnational corporations Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP, OMV and other fossil fuel majors, which extensively cooperated with Putin’s regime during past decades, should be stripped of cash, political influence and control over media. Next, their CEOs with Rex Tillerson in the front seat should be taken to international criminal court for crimes against humanity - they deserve a tribunal together with Mr. Putin as his close aides in the project of planetary destruction and war against people and nature. Therefore, we call for blocking, picketing and climbing over the offices of oil and gas companies of the Russian Federation and all their business partners in the EU, UK and worldwide. We hope that in this way it is possible to attract the necessary attention of politicians, media and the general public. We need to make it clear to all people in Europe who worry about Ukraine’s fate, global peace and climate justice, that each responsible person can and should impose sanctions against Putin’s regime, Gazprom and other fossil majors like Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP, OMV and others, going under the representative offices of these companies and acting in all possible ways to dismantle their financial and political influence. As a priority action in European capitals, we are calling to block the offices of Gazprom, Rosneft, Transneft, Surgutneftegas, LukOil, Russian Coal, Karadeniz, SUEK, Kuzbassrazrezugol and other companies, which supply oil, gas and coal from Russia to the EU.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/02/11/global-newsletter-61/,"Rebels rally in Johannesburg, South Africa as part of the Global Coastline Rebellion. In this issue: Global Coastline Rebellion | XRUK Kill The Bill | Murder In Colombia | Dear rebels, It’s only just begun, but already 2022 has seen a series of catastrophic oil spills devastate coastlines around the world. First, an oil tanker was rocked by waves from the Tonga tsunami while docked at a refinery in Peru; then an underwater pipeline ruptured off the coast of Thailand; then a pipeline burst in Amazonian Ecuador; and finally, a vast oil production ship exploded in the Niger Delta. These accidents show with horrifying immediacy the damage that oil extraction can wreak on our oceans. But the truth is that the oil industry causes and courts ecological destruction at every stage. And it is almost always inflicted on the Global South. Dutch rebels in The Hague condemn the recent oil spills - one of dozens of solidarity actions held as part of the Global Coastline Rebellion. Multinational oil corporations like Repsol, Equinor, and Shell use seismic surveys that destroy marine life to find new reserves, and then use reckless methods of extraction that many countries in the Global North have banned. This is about to happen in Argentina, where the government has greenlit plans for offshore exploration, drilling and fracking by Equinor and Shell. Argentinians marched in their thousands against the decision, but have been ignored. An international alliance of activists watching the unfolding disasters and regional protests decided something more had to be done. These corporations destroying the planet one oil spill and seismic blast at a time needed to be confronted – and not just where the oil was spilling, but also where the profits were collecting. The Global Coastline Rebellion, a multinational day of resistance against a multinational threat, was conceived just a few weeks before its 4th February launch. Yet it ended up drawing together more than 50 movements, organisations, and communities, from 19 different countries. You can find out more about this unprecedented global action by checking out Action Highlights. A coalition of activists including rebels rally in London to Kill The Bill. Photo: Crispin Hughes As well as spills, we highlight a brilliant campaign by XRUK to stop a bill - proposed government legislation that could effectively criminalise all disruptive protests in the country. Finally we have a tragic report on yet more murdered activists in Colombia, one of the most dangerous places to protest in the world. While the disasters have come thick and fast this year, so has the worldwide mass mobilisation. By uniting activists from multiple movements rooted all over the globe, and shifting the focus from abstract goals to concrete demands about ending corporate extractivism, the Global Coastline Rebellion has ushered in an exciting new template for climate activism. And one of the organisers has assured the newsletter that this is just the beginning.... Get involved in XR wherever you are!

Support the Rebellion 4 FEB | Worldwide Activists in Lima, Peru protest the ecocide of Spanish oil giant Repsol, while rebels in Ibiza, Spain tell the company to take responsibility for the oil spilling from its Peruvian refinery. Thousands of rebels and other activists have united around the world to protest the continuous devastation of coastlines in the Global South by multinational oil companies. The coast of Peru is still an ecological disaster site after an oil tanker was hit by freak waves at a refinery owned by oil giant Repsol. But rather than take responsibility, the Spanish corporation has downplayed the disaster and tried to deflect blame. So while Peruvian activists rallied outside their Congress building in Lima to demand Repsol clean up their mess and go, rebels in cities all over Spain staged protests outside Repsol offices and petrol stations demanding the same. While communities rallied against Norwegian oil company Equinor in 27 cities across Argentina, rebels in Oslo bared all during a frosty visit to its corporate headquarters. Activists from the Global South and North came together to also condemn Equinor, the Norwegian state owned oil company which is about to start seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and fracking off Argentina’s coastline. The plan is so ecologically hazardous that it would be illegal in Norway. Yet the Argentine government rubber-stamped it at the end of 2021, sparking huge protests across the entire country. For the Global Coastline Rebellion, thousands of activists mobilised in 27 cities across Argentina. Rallies included artistic performances featuring dancing marine life, dystopian oil-stained beach-goers, and angry nudists smashing up oil wells. In Norway rebels also got naked, despite the freezing conditions. They bared all as they marched through the snow outside Equinor’s headquarters in Oslo, but only once an 'Army of Cleaners' did their best to wipe the dirty company away. Norwegian embassies in Serbia and Germany also got a visit from local activists. Ogoni rebels march through Bori city in Nigeria. The region has been plundered and severely polluted by Shell for decades. Equinor’s fracking partner in Argentina is Shell, and the British oil company was condemned for its eco-crimes across the globe. In South Africa, where a court recently stopped Shell from conducting seismic surveys off the Wild Coast, activists danced along Cape Town’s beaches and marched down Johannesburg’s streets. Standard Bank also got a visit for its financing of the terrifying regional oil pipeline, EACOP. In the UK, Shell’s London HQ was visited by a samba band, and rebels sounded an air gun every ten seconds to mimic the seismic surveys that Shell conducts to find new reserves under the ocean, despite the devastating effect the intense blasting has on whales and dolphins and other marine life. In Nigeria, where Shell has an appalling record of pollution, ecocide and colluding with repressive governments to murder local activists, Ogoni rebels marched through the coastal city of Bori demanding a fossil-fuel-free future and an end to the soot from gas flaring. A large rally in Berlin visited both the Norwegian and Spanish embassies to demand an end to fossil fuel colonialism in the Global South. Another highlight was the rally outside the World Bank in Washington DC, where speakers condemned the institution for indebting Global South nations and forcing them to open up their resources to ecocidal corporations, thereby driving the climate crisis. There were dozens more actions around the world worthy of coverage, from Uruguay to Portugal, and Denmark to Ecuador. Considering the global action was conceived only a few weeks ago, and co-ordinated by a small international team running on little more than loving rage, the result has been spectacular. Find out about future global mobilisations by emailing coastline.rebellion@protonmail.com 15 & 17 JAN | UK Many hundreds march through central London to Parliament. Photo: Andrea Domeniconi Rebels joined other activists to rally against The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, a piece of legislation that if made law will severely restrict people’s right to protest. Thousands of ‘Kill The Bill’ demonstrators marched through cities across the UK to reject the government’s attempt to criminalise future XR and Black Lives Matter protests. To become law, the bill must be voted through by both chambers of Parliament - the elected House of Commons and the unelected House of Lords. With the Lords voting on the most contentious clauses of the bill just days after the rally, XR Digital Rebellion deluged them with 13,500 emails as well as thousands of calls and tweets. Rebels in Oxford highlight how the bill criminalises one-person protests & road blockades. The pressure worked. The government’s attempts to ban ‘noisy’ protests, and imprison protesters who lock-on or block roads, were all voted down by the Lords, along with many other repressive measures. However the bill remains a fundamental attack on protest in England and Wales, granting police more powers over peaceful protesters, and creating new ‘public nuisance’ offences that could see them imprisoned for up to ten years! In an open letter published online, hundreds of academics and clinicians warned that the bill would disengage, disempower, and socially isolate young people, the activists of the future. This rebel officially changed his name to Kill The Police Crime Sentencing And Courts Bill! The bill could also have terrible international repercussions, with other governments using it as an excuse to further crackdown on their own climate activists. A total of 1,540 land defenders were murdered worldwide between 2012 and 2020. While the bill is promoted as a means to prevent violence and protect the population, it actually allows the government to stifle dissent, and silence those who demand accountability from them. That so many people took part in the recent Kill The Bill protests is incredibly inspiring. But while the bill may be diminished, it has not gone away. This fight isn’t over, and future mobilisations will be needed to safeguard many of the recent wins.

The year has started with alarming violence in Colombia, where over a period of just ten days five environmental activists were murdered. Two members of the Nasa indigenous community, one just 14 years old, were shot by an armed gang while patrolling their lands. A few days later another member of the same unarmed indigenous guard was shot when the gang returned onto the reservation. Earlier in the week the body of a leading land rights campaigner was found in a river, and a professor of agriculture involved in local activism was shot while riding his motorcycle along a highway. A die-in outside the Attorney General's Office. The sign: Does defending life condemn mine? Photo: @an.vargasb 20 rebels from XR Colombia joined with other local movements, including Fridays for the Future Bogotá, to protest in front of the Attorney General's Office and demand justice for those activist leaders who had been assassinated. They made speeches, held up portraits of the victims along with a blood splattered Colombian flag, and called for the long-delayed ratification of the Escazú agreement, which would mandate protection for activists but has been opposed by mining and agribusiness lobbyists. The action finished with a die-in. 10 - 31 JAN | British Columbia, Canada The first wave of actions by Save Old Growth ends with a blockade of a Vancouver bridge. The campaign to end old tree logging saw multiple blockades of the Trans-Canada Highway and 54 arrests. They will return to the roads on March 21st. 1 FEB | Vienna, Austria Armed with an eviction order, police clear a long-standing protest camp on a road construction site, and take 48 activists (including rebels) into custody. 1 - 4 FEB | Rome, Italy Last Generation in Italy rebranded the Ministry of Ecological Transition as the ‘Ministry Of Fraud’. The rebel group demanded a meeting with ministers and went on to blockade more roads in the city. 4 FEB | Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Germany Last Generation in Germany continues its Save Food Save Lives campaign. The group have been blockading motorways day after day, braving driver aggression and arrest, sitting with food discarded by supermarkets to highlight the 18 million tons of food wasted by Germans each year.

This is the most comprehensive and considered reading list you could even hope to imagine, split into categories like science, emotional support, spiritual, fiction, and children’s books. Counterpunch: Whales Could Save the Climate, Unless the Military Destroys Them Hawaii-based journalist Koohan Paik-Mander uncovers the miraculous role that whales have played in delaying climate catastrophe, but how military exercises by the US Army are decimating them, and hurtling us ever faster towards climate meltdown. Truthout: Cryptocurrency’s Carbon Footprint Can’t Be Ignored South African writer Robin Scher explores how digital ‘mining’ for cryptocurrency uses a staggering amount of energy, and as various crypto-coins and NFTs become more mainstream, their carbon footprints are likely to get exponentially worse. Plants are the crucial first link in the food chain. But in many ecosystems, the next link in the chain is mostly insects—and most insects can’t eat plants they didn’t evolve with. Replace native plants with exotics, and the ecosystem crashes. Dr. Douglas Tallamy, an American entomologist, and his students, discovered the critical importance of native plants. He has since dedicated himself to convincing homeowners to plant natives to support urban and suburban biodiversity. He is a clear, accessible writer and a kind and friendly man. Being an American, most of Dr. Tallamy’s books offer advice tailor-made to Americans. The Nature of Oaks is no exception. However, over half the planet has its native oak species, so his argument, that oaks are especially important to plant and to protect, is relevant to folks of many countries. The details of the rich ecology of oaks vary from place to place, but not the richness, nor the principle that some simple things we can do actually make a difference. Avoid Amazon.

When I watched it unfold on TV, I was amazed. It was such a wonderful example of people-power. I started reading articles about climate change and was shocked by how serious it all was. We’re just not told how serious it is. I made it to the October rebellion and met some amazing people. I remember meeting this man in Victoria Coach Station who was heading back to Wales after spending the day locked to a lorry outside the Home Office. He just said to me “you do what you can.” The first time I was arrested was at an HS2 compound in March or April of 2020. The police were not nice. This woman was grabbing at me so tightly, even when I said I wasn’t going to run away. In the van I was stuck in this cage, and at the station it took a lot of requests to get a cup of tea. I wasn’t planning on getting arrested and accepted a caution. My son is studying film production, and I was worried that if he made it to Hollywood my criminal record would mean I couldn’t visit him. He wasn’t impressed by my arrest - he was anti-XR back then and said I was irresponsible going to a protest because of Covid. But he was upset because I’d stopped him going to a party for the same reason. As time went on, I felt my excuse for not getting arrested - visiting my son in Hollywood - just wasn’t good enough. I decided to take part in a Rebellion of One and was arrested a second time. Then I went to a talk by Roger Hallam and got involved in Insulate Britain during its third week. We went out onto the motorways again and again and again. We were in the news all the time. I was arrested another seven times. These days the police are more reasonable, supportive even. We’re not violent and we don’t scream abuse, so in a way we make their job easy. But a lot of people couldn’t see the connection between insulation and the climate crisis. And rather than explain it, the media just egged them on to hate us. Now I’m involved in a new campaign where the connection to the climate crisis is immediate. It’s called Just Stop Oil. The main demand is to stop all new oil exploration, but we also want oil workers to be retrained for jobs in renewable energy. There are Zoom welcome meetings every Sunday, and actions will be starting in March. I’m sure I’ll be involved. My son has helped me with leafleting for Just Stop Oil. He even brought a friend to a public meeting where I did a talk about the experience of civil resistance. Afterwards he said “I’m so proud of you”. It really meant a lot.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/01/19/brazil-on-fire-deforestation/,"I'm a Brazilian biologist and I actually cannot believe what I'm seeing...Brazil is on fire! We are losing biodiversity, killing and displacing wild animals and producing smoke, a lot of smoke. Our forests are adding carbon to the atmosphere instead of absorbing it. And, year after year, the situation seems to get worse, and the burning season extends for a longer period. About 30 years ago, we assumed that our water potential would last forever and today we are paying the bill for our lack of planning and our arrogance, experiencing a water crisis that has everything to do with deforestation, as forests regulate the water cycle. If it is any consolation, it seems that the country suffers from a double personality: while forests are being wildly burned on the one hand, there are reforestation projects with encouraging results on the other. Humboldt’s wooly monkey in the Amazon Rainforest The history of deforestation in Brazil began in 1500, when the Portuguese invaded the country and started colonization. The gateway was the coast, which is more than 7000 km long, bathed by the Atlantic Ocean. 1502 was the start of the great exploitation of pau-brasil, which is a tree found in the Atlantic Forest that can reach up to 30 meters in height and a meter and a half in log diameter. From this tree, a reddish tincture is obtained, similar to a product found in East Asia at the Age of Discovery. The explorers signed lease contracts, committed to the devastation of areas and the construction of facilities to support extraction. Another objective of the Portuguese was to find precious metals, mainly gold, which was only found around 1693 in the most central regions of Brazil, as they invaded the land. It took them more than 100 years to deforest and manage to penetrate the dense Atlantic Forest to finally find the gold in the states of Mato Grosso (which means thick bush) and Goiás. In 1532, our agricultural history began, when sugarcane was brought here, and replaced parts of our forests. Since then, Brazil has been continuously deforested for agriculture, livestock, logging and mining. What about the indigenous people? They cannot be forgotten as they are known as the keepers of the forest, living in harmony with nature. Just for an introduction, as this is an extensive subject that must be dealt with separately, suffice it to say that there’s no solution to the climate crisis without Indigenous Peoples and Indigenous Land. Since 1500, as the country was invaded, their history has been marked by brutality, slavery, violence, disease and genocide. In short, as the ""civilization"" grew, replacing the forests, the indigenous, which in the beginning were 100% of the population (11 million), now make up only 0.4% (approximately 900,000 people). On XR's blog you can read a very interesting interview with Jimmy Piaguaje, a young indigenous Siekopai, in the Ecuadorian Amazon, by Beth Pitts. Amazonia Real photo by Takumã Kuikuro This image shows the different and varied biomes (different types of dominant vegetation) that we have here in Brazil (the Atlantic Ocean is on the right). Biomes in Brazil - Wikipedia In addition to the Amazon Rainforest, which is known worldwide, Brazil has other biomes. One of them, Pantanal, which translates as swamp, is just 3% of our territory but... in 2020, 26% of it was burned. How can the water be on fire? This picture is from Fundação Ecotrópica, an NGO that is working to save animals from fires in Pantanal The Pantanal is so deeply affected by the fires that the animals that have not died or been seriously injured are finding it difficult to get food. There are NGOs, such as Fundação Ecotrópica, bringing food to the animals and transporting alligators to places with more water to try to save them. People who work at these NGOs report sad situations, such as wild monkeys approaching humans with outstretched hands, asking for food. The Amazon Rainforest, once called ""Lungs of the Earth"", is also being deeply threatened by wildfires as it was never before. This huge forest is about half the size of Europe! The vegetation is very dense and the trees are very tall, retaining a large amount of moisture within the forest. It is a challenging place for survivalists, as they can't find dry matter to use to light and maintain the small fires they need to keep animals away. As it is usually so wet, the vegetation is not fire-adapted. Just for comparison, the Cerrado vegetation is fire adapted (the trees have thick bark, with the appearance of cork, which provides thermal insulation and gives them protection from high temperatures). Actually, there are studies saying that, with the deforestation that exposes and thus dries the forest, followed by wildfires, parts of the Amazon started to emit more carbon dioxide than they absorb! The Amazon Rainforest is so important, the trees are so old... Imagine the time needed to develop such biodiversity. In 2019, researchers found a new highest tree hidden in the forest, a Dinizia excelsa, 88 meters tall. Every giant tree is capable of absorbing 300 to 500 times more carbon than the smaller ones. Imagine the medicinal plants, the exotic fruits still to be discovered if they’re not burned before we find them! Planet Earth has cycles. In elementary school one learns about the carbon cycle. In a summarized view, CO₂ is released into the environment mainly by human activities and it is then absorbed by the plants through photosynthesis, forming plant matter. In 1970, the amount of CO₂ in the atmosphere was about 320 ppm; in 2021, it was approximately 410 ppm. For a deeply scientific explanation of the carbon cycle and to get informed about other effects of climate change, please read 'Emergency on Planet Earth', written by Dr. Emily Grossman of XR Scientists. In 2021, IPCC - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, became famous for proving that climate change is undoubtedly related to human activities. Quoting the IPCC report ""Every ton of CO₂ emissions contributes to global warming"". Recently, a new technology to absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS), has been tested, but the results are so far disappointing and it seems the technology is acting more as a distraction to sidestep the real problem, which is that we need to stop burning fossil fuels. So, we are building high-cost CCS that lack functionality while destroying forests that have been our allies absorbing carbon for centuries. Photo by Mayke Toscano/Secom-MT The relationship between the agricultural sector and fires is evident. One of the ways in which this happens is through deforestation, followed by burning, to free up the land, whether for agricultural practice or for cattle raising. Forest fires can also occur when plantations are burned to clear land for the next harvest, and then spiral out of control, spreading to neighboring forested areas. There is also the illegal logging and, precisely because it is illegal, it is done hidden in deeper areas of the forest, leaving scars and exposing areas to the external climate (drier air and higher temperatures). The increase in average temperatures caused by climate change, which was highlighted by the IPCC report, is also one of the causes for the worsening of fires, as the increase in evaporation dries everything, making the ignition and the spread of fires easier. Photo by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of the Environment) Theoretically, the practice of burning to clear the land for the next harvest is regulated by the government, and can only be done with authorization, taking into account the season, plantation size and prevailing climatic factors at the time. However, as there is very little inspection and as it is difficult to prove the origin of the fire after it has already spread, this practice continues to be used irresponsibly, despite the environmental crimes law, which punishes those who cause forest fires with 2 to 4 years in prison plus a fine. The federal government says it is taking action, inspecting more, sending fire brigades and increasing the integration of fire-fighting agencies. However, when you look at the document with the proposed measures, the first thing you see is that the plan for the 2021/2022 target is to reduce burning and illegal deforestation to historical average levels. If more than 94% of deforestation is illegal, should not the goal be to eliminate this crime and arrest those responsible? According to Humans Rights Watch, since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019, the government has weakened Brazil's ability to meet its commitments to end illegal deforestation and to reduce deforestation in general. The civilian environmental agencies were dismantled, resulting in a brutal reduction in the number of people responsible for inspection, with consequent mitigation of law enforcement. Furthermore, they allege that the government has been working to ease restrictions on use in protected areas, where illegal deforestation and fires often occur. This resulted in an increase in impunity in relation to environmental laws. And, to make matters worse, the agro-sector is well known to be profit-oriented, with several companies listed on the stock exchange. It takes advantage of all the gaps left by the government, which only has eyes for short term economic issues, based on the fact that the next presidential election will take place in 2022. If the government looked to the future (not just to the next election) and took the environment into account, rather than ignoring it and turning their eyes from the climate emergency, deforestation would surely end. To talk about numbers, in 2020 there were 222,798 fire outbreaks in Brazil (in 2013 there were 128.145) and just in September 26, 2021, there were 1725 new outbreaks (according to the fire monitoring website of INPE - National Institute for Space Research). Burned area in the Amazon - photo by Carlos Celestino/Secom-MT Recently, two reports from the Globo Rural Program (news about agribusiness, agriculture, livestock, environment and weather forecast) caught my attention: On the one hand, I find it commendable that the agricultural sector is so resilient, working to adapt to and even take advantage of situations created and exacerbated by global warming. On the other hand, I find it disturbing that this same sector, which is investing money in research and adapting, is also responsible for the destruction of forests, as all these advances are made as a result of deforestation of native vegetation and the consequent alteration of the environment. I think it's time for the sector to start tackling the causes that influence global warming itself besides only focusing on mitigating the effects. And when the rivers dry up, where will the water for irrigation come from? Mentions calling Brazil the granary of the world are common and started in the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas (1937 to 1945), who used the slogan ""Brazil, breadbasket of the world"". According to the CNA (Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock of Brazil), the country's grain production alone is enough to feed four times its population, or more than 850 million people. In 2020, Brazilian agribusiness accounted for 26,6% of the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product), a jump compared from previous years, since 2012: 19,1% - 18,8% - 18,7% - 20,1% - 22,3% - 20,8% - 20,1% - 20,5% - 26,6% (source CEPEA). The sad truth is - for those in power - the dollars from agriculture and livestock export are all that matter. In September, 2021, dust storms were a headline in the Brazilian newspapers (watch the video). This happened in cities in the interior of the state of São Paulo. It is believed that the exposure of the soil by the burning used to cut sugarcane and the drought are among the main factors. São Paulo (southeast) is far away from the Amazon Rainforest but there is a relationship through the transport of moisture from evapotranspiration (loss of water caused by evaporation from the soil and plant transpiration) from the forest to this region, so this state is also being affected by deforestation of the major forest. Since the “discovery” of Brazil, São Paulo has been deforested by itself as it is one of the main gateways to the country and a path for its exploration. Initially, sugar cane was planted here, then coffee and currently we also produce rice, peanuts, corn, fruits, soy, vegetables and greens, as well as some livestock. All of this leads to soil degradation problems, aggravated by the lack of protection of native vegetation, which has been poorly conserved. Dust storm in Franca (São Paulo - Brazil) | SOCIAL NETWORKS/REPRODUCTION Brazil has been suffering severely from a water crisis that threatens consumption, irrigation, navigation and the generation of hydroelectric energy, which represents 63% of our energy matrix. In the south, the Paraná River is facing a historic drought and the waterway has been paralyzed since September 2021, due to the low water level. But it is from the problems that solutions arise and in various regions of the country projects have emerged that integrate agriculture and the environment. Let's take a look at some of these pioneering initiatives, which use reforestation as a solution, from water recovery to control of emissions in livestock, with several other positive effects, such as a pleasant feeling of well-being for rural workers and greater engagement of the entire community. Reforestation of a sugarcane mill in the city of Ourinhos, São Paulo The farm reforested part of its land, planting 550,000 trees at a total cost of R$ 11 Mi (about 2 million dollars), and the results took several years to be felt. Among them are the recovery of riparian forests (which prevent the erosion and silting of rivers) and the creation of ecological corridors, through which animals can transit. A pleasant surprise was the recovery of springs and the realization that the vegetation cover is capable of recovering the land's water potential. Crop-livestock-forest integration (Integração lavoura-pecuária-floresta - ILPF) Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation linked to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply) has been carrying out research on ILPF systems since the 1980s. This is a production strategy that has been growing in Brazil in recent years. This form of integrated system seeks to optimize land use, raise productivity levels in the same area, use inputs better, diversify production and generate more income and employment. All of this is done in an environmentally correct manner, with low emissions of greenhouse gases or even mitigation of these gases. Water Conservation Project (Projeto Conservador das Águas) The project was conceived in 2005 through Municipal Law No. 2100 with the objective of maintaining the quality of water sources in Extrema (a city in the state of Minas Gerais - central region of Brazil) and promoting the environmental adequacy of rural properties. It prioritizes preventive rather than corrective action. It even includes payment for environmental services by the government (through a Federal Law) to rural producers, for reforestation and for the preservation of native forest! (Watch the video on this site. It is in Portuguese, but it is amazing to see the before and the after reforestation and the water volume recovery of spring). From these projects, three conclusions can be drawn: Seedling nursery for reforestation - Tânia Rêgo/Agência Brasil As a biology student, I visited the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. As a nature lover, I went to the Amazon Rainforest. All these biomes are unique and so exotic. As I watch the fires consuming trees more than 1000 years old, I think ""How can there be people who in their right minds let this happen?"" A skyscraper goes up in a few months, a city is built in a few years, but a forest takes millennia to form! We urgently need to stop consuming the planet's resources so wildly. Sometimes, I think of humanity as if we are a swarm of grasshoppers consuming everything in sight until there is nothing left. And when the resources run out, what will we consume? I also think about the younger ones, who want to be heard and participate in decisions but are pushed away precisely with the excuse that they are young. They are the ones who will inherit this sick planet that we are leaving. Spider monkey in the Amazon Rainforest The IPCC report was mentioned twice in this article, but the scientists have already done their work. They have proven that climate change is being caused by human activities and they have also designed scenarios for the future, based on our emissions from now on. At the moment, the average increase in global temperature is 1.07°C. Unfortunately, we are now facing the worst scenarios, because we are increasing our emissions instead of diminishing them! From now on, the challenges are mainly political and the agreements made at COP26 did not reflect the enormity of the problem we are facing, while the politicians continue to postpone taking real action to face the problem. Only solid governance, which recognizes the synergy between the multiple causes of the problem, and persistently invests in all of them, can reach a solution and the clock is ticking.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2022/01/14/global-newsletter-60/,"This student supporter of Insulate Britain is currently in prison for his brave civil resistance. In this issue: XR Serbia Win | XR Finland Victory | Blockade Australia | Insulate Britain Dear rebel, To start your year on the front foot, the first global newsletter of 2022 is focused on victories - both in our movement and in climate activism as a whole. Some of these victories may be small, some of them may be partial, some of them may well unravel in the blink of a corrupt politician’s eye. But when you’re fighting the kind of gargantuan forces we are (corporations, governments, the very cogs of capitalism itself) every shard of success must be savoured. This issue we report on how Serbian rebels helped put both their government and the multinational mining company Rio Tinto on the backfoot. Read about the massive street blockades against a new lithium mine in Action Highlights. We also report on how the tenacious rebels of Elokapina (XR Finland) got their government to submit to one of their demands. After two rebellions and hundreds of arrests, the Environment Minister recently held her first climate crisis briefing to the press and public. 100,000 protesters turn up to swarm a central highway in Serbia. The blockade bore fruit. Another victory we should all be inspired by is the state of climate activism itself. Over the last year an amazing number of new protest groups have hit the headlines, many testing out bold tactics and novel messaging to further our collective cause. But as our movement expands, so does the potential for confusion. Where did these groups come from? Where are they heading? What is their relationship to XR? In a Special Report we talk to the activists behind Blockade Australia, Insulate Britain, Last Generation: Citizens’ Assemblies Now, and Shell Must Fall. Although this newsletter only has room for a taster, you can read The Full Report over on the XR Global Website. Finland’s Foreign Minister visits Elokapina’s camp outside Parliament to chat about the climate during the Autumn Rebellion. The steady, soft pressure on politicians bore fruit. If that’s not enough triumph for you, we also celebrate activist victories in Switzerland, South Africa, Canada and the UK in this month’s Action Roundup. There really are a lot of wins being racked up if you’re in the right mindset to see them! Emissions may be rising, but so is the loving rage of climate activists all around the globe. We hope this newsletter helps you see the sunny side of what 2022 might bring. Get involved in XR wherever you are!

Support the Rebellion 27 NOV - Present | Serbia A rebel tells Rio Tinto what to do. The nationwide and weekly street protests are ongoing. Serbia has seen a series of major protests across the country against a planned lithium mine. A coalition of different eco-activist groups, which XR Serbia supports, managed to mobilise thousands of people for road blockades in the capital Belgrade and dozens more cities and towns. People across the political spectrum took to the streets to protest against Rio Tinto, the giant mining corporation that would develop the mine, and the Serbian government, for fast-tracking two law changes to ensure the mine was greenlit. As well as disgust at perceived government corruption, the protestors saw the proposal as neo-colonialist. Serbia’s countryside would be destroyed, its rivers polluted, all so richer nations could have electric cars with lithium batteries and restore their own environments. Many believed they would benefit from the unearthed lithium about as much as Africans did from the diamond trade. Despite the presence of riot police, clashes have been minimal. But some regions have seen police retreat to give violent gangs free reign to attack protestors. In early December the two hour blockade of a major highway in Belgrade was joined by a staggering 100,000 people. After that seismic event, the government dropped its planned law changes. Then came the seemingly amazing news that Rio Tinto had put its mining plans on hold. The truth is that the mining corporation is still pushing for a deal. XR Serbia travelled to Jadar Valley, the western farming region that is the site of the proposed mine. Local landowners are still being phoned by Rio Tinto and being urged to sell their land. So the weekly protests continue - the crowds smaller than before, but still in their hundreds. XR Serbia is a young rebel chapter, launched in May and grown from a Fridays For Future branch in Belgrade. Today they have 15 active members with more groups forming in other cities. Their English language skills have made them instrumental in bringing international attention to Serbia’s wave of environmental struggles. There is an argument that new mineral mines are necessary if we are to transition away from fossil fuels. But XR Serbia stresses that we cannot simply exchange one non-renewable, ecologically-damaging energy source for another. Instead, we need to embrace degrowth, which means reducing our overall energy use and rejecting an economic system geared towards over-consumption.

We are sorry.” Photo: Tero Ojala Throughout the pandemic, politicians have spoken publicly – sometimes every day – to communicate about the health emergency and what is being done to stop it from getting worse. But why aren’t they doing the same for the climate crisis? That was the rationale behind Elokapina’s (XR Finland’s) newest demand - that their government begin regular crisis communications about the climate emergency. Two rebellions later, the government has been forced to sit up and listen. The demand was unveiled during Elokapina’s Summer Rebellion, and pushed again during their Autumn Rebellion, where over a thousand rebels took to the streets of Helsinki across ten days of actions. “Climate emergency now - Crisis communications!” was chanted outside the Finnish Parliament. Rebels were inspired by the idea that if the public saw the government taking the climate as seriously as Covid-19, maybe they would too. These ‘crisis communications’ could lead to a mandate for radical solutions. Hundreds of rebels mass outside Finland’s Parliament to begin the Autumn Rebellion. The police responded by detaining a staggering 495 rebels, but they couldn’t stop the demand from receiving huge media attention. The rebels also set up a dedicated “politicians’ microphone” outside parliament, inviting prominent figures to be interviewed about the climate emergency. Many showed up, including the Minister of Internal Affairs, and rebels discussed the demands with representatives from all the governing parties. In November, the rebels’ campaign bore fruit. The newly appointed Minister of Environment and Climate Change announced that she would begin regular crisis briefings about the climate and nature emergencies. The first briefing was held on 15th December, themed around the state of Finnish forests and the implementation of the EU’s biodiversity strategy. Journalists and members of the public were invited to ask questions. The public is now being asked to suggest themes for future briefings. Elokapina’s Blood Brigade silently flows through Helsinki during the Autumn Rebellion. Over the past two years, Elokapina has faced massive obstacles in its fight for climate justice. Rebels have been pepper-sprayed by police, driven over by angry motorists, and harassed both online and off by far-right hate groups – all for simply telling the truth. Given that many Finnish rebels are under 30, the media has frequently dismissed them as “youth”. But instead of being diminished, Elokapina’s membership has grown from 300 to over 1400 in little more than a year. Their courage has led to an array of other successes, including convincing Finland’s biggest newspaper as well as its national public broadcaster to launch dedicated coverage of climate and nature news. The Finnish government still hasn’t declared a climate emergency – and at the current rate, the country will overshoot its carbon budget in just four years. “But these crisis briefings are a start,” said one rebel, “and we’ll keep building the movement until they can’t ignore us any more.” For updates from Elokapina/XR Finland follow them on Twitter. Last Generation rebels prepare to blockade a motorway in Rome, Italy. The last year has been a bleak one for climate activists. We’ve seen extreme weather events proliferate, political inaction dressed up as progress (again), and a return to rising global emissions after the economic slowdown brought on by the pandemic. But one aspect of 2021 that we should take solace in is climate activism itself. There has been an amazing array of new groups and campaigns popping up, many using bold tactics and fresh approaches to push nonviolent direct action (NVDA) to new levels. The world of climate activism has never been so broad and exciting, but also never so confusing. What are the aims of these new climate groups? What is their relationship (if any) with XR? What can we expect from them in 2022? We spoke to four of them - Blockade Australia, Insulate Britain, Last Generation, and Shell Must Fall - to build some bridges and get some clarity as we ready ourselves for another year of global rebellion… Established Early 2021 | Australia Activists abseil from coal handling machinery on the tenth consecutive day of disruption. Just over a year ago, rebels from XR Brisbane joined activists from other backgrounds in a move to Sydney, where their actions could have greater reach and a bigger economic impact. The relocation became an opportunity to start fresh, and do NVDA however they liked. They started planning a series of actions that would be more intensive, offensive, and disruptive than had come before, and more activists started to join them. While the world was watching COP26 enter its turgid second week, they were ready to launch their first wave of climate resistance. For eleven consecutive days, Blockade Australia disrupted the Port of Newcastle, the largest coal port in the world. They blocked the trains transporting coal from the region’s open-cut mines, pressed emergency buttons, and climbed onto the port’s coal-loading equipment. An indigenous activist blocks the port railway on the first day of disruption. The biggest lesson from the campaign was how important it was to make the disruption sustained. For the first few days there was little interest in the actions, but by the second week the regional politicians and media were in a frenzy, and the group was famous around the world. Despite threats of 25-year jail sentences, only one of the 28 arrested was imprisoned, and on appeal he was released on strict bail conditions three days into his one-year sentence. The rest received hefty fines of Au$1500 and community corrections orders, meaning they cannot reoffend for two years. Unlike other recently emerged groups, prison is not a part of Blockade Australia’s strategy. But those corrections orders have not stopped them from planning a second wave of climate resistance in Sydney for June 2022. Activists hit emergency stop buttons and harness themselves to coal port machinery. While Blockade Australia has no formal relationship with XR Australia, they are in contact with many local XR groups who support their aim to maximise disruption. Blockade Australia recognises how vital XR was in paving the way for their own organisation. They hope XR can initiate its own sequence of sustained mobilisations some day soon.

I worked for a decade in Silicon Valley but grew sick of it: the consumerism of the USA, I found it dehumanising. So I returned to Argentina and started a sustainable community in Mendoza Province, a region with a history of fighting for the environment. Desert people fighting for their water. In 2018 I founded EcoLeaks and published a government report (provided by a whistleblower) on the effects of fracking in Mendoza. The government lied about the contamination of aquifers, a betrayal of the people which led to mass mobilisation against fracking. In my town alone of 30,000 people, 15,000 took to the streets. I was forced to leave Argentina for Germany in 2019 as the situation intensified. I faced many false criminal charges, including violence, drug dealing, and public intimidation. There were death threats against my girlfriend and my family. We need to find ways to reactivate and excite people. Communication, persuasion, explanation. Move beyond abstract demands. I helped set up XR Mendoza, considering XR a spinal cord of action. A way to connect environmental groups and build international solidarity. To join the dots and cast light on the crimes of companies, such as BP, Shell, Repsol, Total, and Wintershall. Shale Must Fall, for example, is a coalition which I coordinate. Groups that have come together for a common cause: to fight fracking and colonisation, the latter disguised as green investment. The Global North holds all the power. We must break away from the European framework and look to the Global South in solidarity. Stop these companies destroying our world. We who have knowledge should have humility, and put ourselves at the service of those who stand on the frontline of climate injustice. In Europe, protest is low risk with high impact, while in the Global South the opposite is true. People are jailed, tortured and murdered—farmers, indigenous peoples, activists. This is happening now as Argentina is destroyed by processes banned elsewhere. Why is fracking not banned worldwide? All I wanted was a nice, hippy, relaxed life. I have ended up fighting a war. But we can win. We can stop this.

The last year has been a bleak one for climate activists. We’ve seen extreme weather events proliferate, political inaction dressed up as progress (again), and a return to rising global emissions after the economic slowdown brought on by the pandemic. But one aspect of 2021 that we should take solace in is climate activism itself. There has been an amazing array of new groups and campaigns popping up, many using bold tactics and fresh approaches to push nonviolent direct action (NVDA) to new levels. The world of climate activism has never been so broad and exciting, but also never so confusing. What are the aims of these new climate groups? What is their relationship (if any) with XR? What can we expect from them in 2022? We spoke to four of them - Blockade Australia, Insulate Britain, Last Generation, and Shell Must Fall - to build some bridges and get some clarity as we ready ourselves for another year of global rebellion… Established Early 2021 | Australia Activists abseil from coal handling machinery on the tenth consecutive day of disruption. Just over a year ago, rebels from XR Brisbane joined activists from other backgrounds in a move to Sydney, where their actions could have greater reach and a bigger economic impact. The relocation became an opportunity to start fresh, and do NVDA however they liked. They started planning a series of actions that would be more intensive, offensive, and disruptive than had come before, and more activists started to join them. While the world was watching COP26 enter its turgid second week, they were ready to launch their first wave of climate resistance. For eleven consecutive days, Blockade Australia disrupted the Port of Newcastle, the largest coal port in the world. They blocked the trains transporting coal from the region’s open-cut mines, pressed emergency buttons, and climbed onto the port’s coal-loading equipment. An indigenous activist blocks the port railway on the first day of disruption. The biggest lesson from the campaign was how important it was to make the disruption sustained. For the first few days there was little interest in the actions, but by the second week the regional politicians and media were in a frenzy, and the group was famous around the world. Despite threats of 25-year jail sentences, only one of the 28 arrested was imprisoned, and on appeal he was released on strict bail conditions three days into his one-year sentence. The rest received hefty fines of Au$1500 and community corrections orders, meaning they cannot reoffend for two years. Unlike other recently emerged groups, prison is not a part of Blockade Australia’s strategy. But those corrections orders have not stopped them from planning a second wave of climate resistance in Sydney for June 2022. Activists hit emergency stop buttons and harness themselves to coal port machinery. While Blockade Australia has no formal relationship with XR Australia, they are in contact with many local XR groups who support their aim to maximise disruption. Blockade Australia recognises how vital XR was in paving the way for their own organisation. They hope XR can initiate its own sequence of sustained mobilisations some day soon.

At the beginning of 2021, rebels in the UK faced a unique problem. The pandemic had left their central tactic of mass mobilisation indefinitely on hold. Yet with COP26 approaching, their government was under sustained pressure to take a lead on the climate crisis. A group of committed rebels within XRUK wanted to capitalise on the situation. They started planning a small-scale, high-stakes campaign that would result in 120 rebels being imprisoned before COP26, exposing the government’s shallow commitment to climate action and shaming it into some kind of climbdown. They wanted the campaign to focus on insulation. 8,500 people in England and Wales die each year because they can’t afford to heat their homes, and insulation is one of the most cost effective ways for the government to cut emissions. Insulate Britain felt it was an easy to understand and achievable demand that could broaden the appeal of eco-activism. But it was clear the campaign would not be acceptable to many in XRUK. Insulation was seen as too boring, and the plan strayed from the 3 key demands to push for a solution, something XR had traditionally avoided. Seeking out prison terms also made many uncomfortable. This student protester is currently in prison for his brave civil resistance. So, despite being made almost entirely of highly active rebels, at the beginning of 2021 Insulate Britain was founded as a separate organisation. In February they started a process of leafleting and holding weekly zoom meetings to find 120 people prepared to serve prison time. By September 13th, the day of their first blockade, they had 93. After a seven-week campaign involving 18 days of road blockades across multiple sites, they had grown to 174 people. Each one was arrested, on average, five times. The government temporarily banned any disruptive protest on any major road in the whole of England. The key difference between an XR blockade and an Insulate Britain blockade is that Insulate Britain targets motorways and everyone, without exception, is able to risk arrest. The campaign focused in particular on the M25, a major motorway that circles London. As well as being a critical piece of infrastructure, it was so large that police could never shield it from sustained disruption. The blockades had a huge media impact, with the majority of the coverage (not all) hysterically negative. The press focused on the rage of the trapped drivers, and spread disinformation about the group blocking ambulances, which in turn increased the rage of trapped drivers. These protestors had ink thrown at them by an angry driver. Each activist underwent eight hours of training to prepare them for the aggression they would face. The truth is that Insulate Britain always had a ‘blue-lights policy,’ meaning emergency vehicles would be allowed through a blockade. One lane always had protestors who were unglued to the tarmac to ensure they could make way. In November, nine protestors were imprisoned for between three to six months. A few days later, in a brave display of solidarity with those imprisoned, 130 rebels were arrested blockading a London junction in contravention of the government ban. 19 more Insulate Britain supporters face up to two years in prison and unlimited fines in February. Groups in Europe and North America have adopted Insulate Britain’s tactics, and while no formal coalition exists, activists are sharing knowledge and giving each other support. As well as preparing more blockades for the spring, Insulate Britain is also seeding a brand new campaign that they will be ready to talk about soon. The key question guiding their plans: what is a proportionate response to the crisis we face? Find out more about Insulate Britain by visiting their website. Established Oct 2021 | Italy Last Generation is an XR campaign and so uses XR banners and symbols. Last Generation is one of the new groups who have adopted the tactics of Insulate Britain. But unlike Insulate Britain, Last Generation is a campaign within XR Italy, rather than a separate organisation. Supporters still use the XR name and symbol. This is partly because the campaign specifically targets XR’s third demand for Citizens’ Assemblies. Which raises the question: why start a new campaign at all? The six-strong rebel affinity group who first presented the idea to XR Italy felt the whole climate activist movement wasn’t going far enough, fast enough. Inspired by the Indian farmers who occupied their capital for over a year to reject privatisation, terrified by the increasingly dire warnings of climate scientists, and frustrated by slow decision-making of the main XR organism, the rebels pitched a satellite campaign that could launch and test new forms of direct action more quickly. Italy was hit by record temperatures and major crop failures last year. Last Generation fears much of the country could become desert within 20-40 years. By December, an eleven-strong team was ready to launch their first wave of actions, blockading motorways in Rome nine times over eleven days. They were spat at and kicked by drivers, arrested a grand total of 74 times, and spent many hours being processed in police jails. Most now have injunctions banning them from entering Rome for one year. If they do, they could face up to two years in prison. Nevertheless, they will be back on the Roman ring roads come February, and also have plans for the spring. Like Blockade Australia, the big lesson for Last Generation was that the regularity of protest was just as impactful as the tactics employed. Last Generation wants XR to heed this lesson and change its methodology. “Waiting six months for each mass mobilisation is not enough against an organised state. We have to get serious,” says one coordinator. Last Generation rebels prepare to unveil their campaign to the world. They cite the non-violent campaigns of the American civil rights movement; The Children’s Crusade where marching kids were bitten by police dogs; The Freedom Riders who repeatedly risked their lives to take part in actions. “As a movement we are kilometres from that right now. We have a choice: to go on with protest as usual and sacrifice nothing, or to suffer and bring about change. The big question is not whether what we’re doing is good or bad. It’s whether it’s working.” Find out more about Last Generation by visiting their website. Established 2019 | The Netherlands December 2021: As shareholders voted on whether Shell should move to the UK, rebels and other activists joined Code Rood to protest outside their meeting in Rotterdam. The story of Shell Must Fall starts in the ancient times of 2017, when Dutch climate activists were coming together to book buses to Germany so they could join the coal mine occupations of Ende Gelände. Some of the activists saw this grouping had potential and founded Code Rood (Code Red) to continue mobilisations within The Netherlands. First, they occupied a major coal harbour in Amsterdam. A year later they launched a blockade in Groningen, home to the biggest natural gas field in Europe. The organisers realised that launching separate actions around the country was diluting their effectiveness. They needed to pick one target and stick to it. In 2019, the Shell Must Fall campaign took shape, the name inspired by a Climate Liberation Bloc chant, and Rhodes Must Fall, the anti-imperialist student movement in South Africa. Various climate groups signalled their support, including XR. The key aim of the campaign was to reject the idea that multinational corporations like Shell could be made to ‘go green’ or respect human rights. They extract fossil fuels and put shareholder value above all else. That is their function. So they must be dismantled. The pandemic kept protests small, but activists still stood outside Shell’s HQ during their 2020 online AGM. Solidarity actions, many including rebels, happened around the world. Shell Must Fall launched in spectacular fashion with an invasion of the 2019 Shell shareholder meeting. To much anger, an activist declared it would be the last Annual General Meeting (AGM) the corporation would hold. Time was up for businesses like Shell. But then the pandemic hit, large public gatherings were made illegal, and Shell’s next AGM was held online. Then, Shell announced it would move its headquarters to London (for reasons of tax avoidance). It’s still not clear if this year’s meeting will be online or off. Shell Must Fall wants to ensure that UK activists adopt their philosophy on Shell, and give the corporation a “warm” welcome when it moves there later this year. They are in discussions with XRUK and other groups, and have just finished their own AGM of sorts: a series of online webinars for Shell Must Fall’s 100+ supporters to discuss strategy. Shell Must Fall gatecrash Shell’s 2019 AGM and really change the atmosphere. Meanwhile, similar groups and campaigns set on dismantling fossil fuel corporations have mushroomed across the globe. Total Must Fall, Shale Must Fall, BP Must Fall, Ineos Will Fall; these are just some of the groups that have emerged since Shell Must Fall’s debut. Each group is wholly independent and there are no rules nor copyrights to infringe. Academics like Andreas Malm are now arguing that the sabotage of fossil fuel infrastructure is morally just. But a Shell Must Fall coordinator is not wholly convinced; “I believe Andreas has made mistakes in his analysis, and the tactics he espouses could trigger a large and damaging backlash to our movement. But with 1.5C past us and even 2C slipping out of reach, it’s a debate we do need to have.” Find out more about Shell Must Fall by visiting their website.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/12/13/wildfire-smoke-alarming-facts/,"This photo, taken by Arnav Kainthola from Pexels, shows a forest fire scorching the earth and sky in India. July 20, 2021. Seems like ages ago, right? So much has happened since then. So much happens every day. But that’s the day—that’s the morning—where this story begins. I was in lower Manhattan, New York City, where we live. Our little walk-up apartment is downtown, about a mile north of where the Twin Towers used to be. We were here that morning, too: September 11, 2001. The sight of the ruptured towers, the smells, the sounds, the smoke… all that fear and anxiety get triggered simply by seeing a photograph from then. Sometimes even looking at one of our family photos with the seemingly invincible, iconic towers in the background will stop my breath for a bit. My husband’s snapshot of our sons and me. (1996) The morning of this past July, though, NYC’s gritty city skies didn’t come from terrorists plowing planes into nearby buildings. Rather, the smoke came from thousands of miles away—charred, scarred winds, coughed up by the fire-ravaged west coast of the United States and Canada. Another New York icon, the Statue of Liberty, poised to welcome people, not pollution. July 21, 2021. © Hope Lourie Killcoyne Go on, breathe in. Breathe out. Let’s think about breathing for a bit. We can all thank marine plants (phytoplankton) for creating most of the world’s oxygen. The ocean also absorbs about a third of Earth’s carbon dioxide. It used to be that land plants—notably trees in rain forests and woodlands—stepped up, too, storing nearly 25% of the CO₂. Used to be. Now, deforestation (usually done by setting fires), is a lose-lose scenario: said fires not only release CO₂—and since 2010, that amount is nearly 20% more than it absorbed—the very act kills trees that could have absorbed the carbon. Why would we thoughtlessly cut off this lifeline—a small but much-needed part of nature’s oxygen tank and carbon sink? Too many of us appreciate neither the forest nor the trees (though with the enforced confinement brought by Covid-19, there has been a slight realignment). A closed luncheonette in Gowanus, Brooklyn. July 28, 2021. © Hope Lourie Killcoyne Thing is, forest fires don’t wait for us to be aware and prepared, let alone grateful; nor do they wait for politicians to calculate yet more of their greenwashing gambits. Once the wind is in their fiery sails, flames from burning trees en masse are exceedingly hard to curtail. And as you might have guessed from this article’s title, there is—however ironic—a lasting consequence in putting out flames: smoke. Smoke spreads much farther than flames, and dangerously smoky winds cannot be constrained. Smoke does not recognize borders, so air is not a local issue. And as the Earth’s lungs are already in serious jeopardy, ours are next. Around the world, people tuned in and saw huge forest fires mercilessly stomping across North America’s west coast. Visuals showing spiralling plumes of smoke are out there, too. What no one could see, though—at least not without an electron microscope—were untold numbers of tiny pollutants surfing along with that smoke. These dangerous particles, called PM2.5 (PM stands for particulate matter), are less than 2.5 microns in diameter, waaay smaller than the full stop (period) at the end of this sentence. By way of comparison, a single strand of hair is 30 times wider... PM2.5 is as small as it is threatening. And to it, size doesn’t matter; wind does. Because with the wind in its sails, it does sail—sometimes for thousands of miles. And then it drops, as happened on July 20, 2021. This diagram, courtesy of the EPA, compares the size of sand, hair, and larger particles that also get inhaled—PM10 (in blue)—to the teeny-tiny bad guy of this story: PM2.5 (the littlest pink dots, lower right). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does what the name implies: strive to protect the environment. It does so by monitoring what’s happening pollution-wise in the States, publicizing that information, and, as necessary, using its powers to enforce compliance. Now, aiming to hold a business accountable for crossing a line is one thing. Doing so for forest fires is not. This XR_NYC sign, posted on an abandoned storefront, holds television news channels accountable by calling out Fox, CNN, and MSNBC for taking “...advertising money from the life-destroying fossil fuel industry.” April 23, 2021. © Hope Lourie Killcoyne So, when it comes to the unprecedented barrage of forest fires—the $1 billion the United States spends every year to fight wildfires notwithstanding—the best that the EPA can do is document the data and put it out there. With the AirNow Interactive Map, anyone can plug in the time, day, and location of what they want to observe. (AirNow.gov, which works with the EPA and other U.S. agencies, provides air-quality data and a bunch of resources. It’s a very cool site, well worth visiting, even if you’re not in Canada, Mexico, or the U.S.) The screenshots below show the day an untold amount of PM2.5 appeared… and, quite tellingly, the day before. The day before and the day of. Pretty striking difference. The day after—July 21—was also notably grizzled. Where I am, in North America, as in far too many places the world over—Siberia, Algeria, Greece, and Australia, to name a few—wildfires are increasingly unstoppable. The immediate death and destruction they cause is harrowing; the incalculable lasting destruction is, as well. When you think about yours, do you think pink? After all, that’s the color often assigned to them. But let’s say you’re a med student—one from the most polluted part of New York City, The Bronx. And you’re studying pulmonology. Still think pink would be the go-to color? “The Lungs in 3D,” on our bookshelf. Let’s look at this example, from the intro for a kids’ book I wrote, “The Lungs in 3D.” It features one of my dad’s real-life experiences: In 1961, as a twenty-five-year-old medical student at the University of Basel in Switzerland, Ronald Chodosh, born and raised in the Bronx, New York, had a startling moment during his first autopsy, which he performed on an elderly Swiss man. The lungs of this near-ninety-year-old, who had spent his entire life in the hills of the Swiss countryside, were a lovely shade of pink. Not surprising, you say? That’s how lungs are depicted in images everywhere—from television to the internet to the illustrations within these very pages. That is true. But in real life, lungs don’t stay pink for long. In the autopsies Chodosh had observed back in New York City, lungs—even those of young people—were, at best, grey, beige, or brown. And those of smokers were far darker, with patches of blackish charcoal scattered about. Lungs are indeed our sponges, filtering the air we breathe. Of course, as long as we have agency over our own bodies, we can try to protect our “sponges” by not actively inviting smoke inside—that is, by not smoking. As for smoke from other, huge sources—smoke that hurts us and the Earth? The best move there is being proactive: it is far better to prevent a wildfire than being forced to put one out. The prefix “wild” ain’t there for nothing. Perhaps this list of nine alarming facts about wildfire smoke below can be employed as a way to shake up people who think distance from fires can let them breathe easily. Because, XR rebel, for those of us determined to provide emergency care for our planet, it is time to use our bodies and voices—yeah: our lungs. Smoke near fires is indisputably toxic, but July 20, 2021, marked NYC’s worst air quality in 15 years. At low altitudes, wildfire smoke can travel for hundreds of miles. But, should the smoke rise just a few miles up, into the jet stream, its pollutants can travel for thousands of miles. Again, distance does not equal safety. As you read earlier, smoke blown for thousands of miles brings a polluting particle miniscule in size, but potentially massive in consequences. And lest anyone feel protected huddling at home, AirNow reminds us that “Wildfire smoke… from outdoors can also enter your home and make it unhealthy to breathe indoor air, too."" A page written in advance of the 2021 fire season, “Wildfires and Smoke,” includes these warnings about PM: The primary pollutant of concern in smoke is particle pollution, often referred to as particulate matter, or PM. The health effects from exposure to the particles in smoke can range from relatively minor (eye and respiratory tract irritation) to serious (exacerbation of asthma and heart failure, and premature death). While most healthy adults and children will recover quickly from wildfire smoke exposure, certain populations may be at greater risk of experiencing health effects, including people with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, children, older adults, pregnant women, and outdoor workers. Toward the end of writing this article, the Lancet Planetary Health journal published THE largest global study (covering roughly 750 cities in over 40 countries) specifically on risk of death due to “wildfire-related PM2.5 pollution.” The 16-year study, conducted by over 70 experts, has many disturbing revelations regarding cardiovascular and respiratory mortality rates. Having identified wildfire-related PM2.5 as being even more toxic than PM2.5 from urban sources, the authors implore policy makers and health professionals to take “urgent action… to reduce health risks from the increasing wildfires.” For people with problems breathing on a good day, the smaller particulate matter—PM2.5—can cause asthma, strokes, and heart attacks. Underlying health conditions are clearly a risk. So, too, are poor (or non-existent) networks of communication between health officials and existing patients—not to mention with communities at large. And healthy people? Should they be worried about working out? Seems so... Wherever money and medical help are scant, residents and institutions there are put at increased risk. In a nutshell, relying on care is a much bigger ask in poor communities. For starters, there is huge income inequality in America. Compound that chasm with the country’s ravenous, for-profit, multi-billion-dollar medical system, and you get ever-growing, increasingly surging, healthcare inequities. The author of an investigation tracking the health of over 5 million Americans for 25 years—Trends in Health Equity in the United States by Race/Ethnicity, Sex, and Income, 1993-2017—stating his goal was focusing on “…health rather than mortality,” said, “there has been a clear lack of progress on health equity during the past 25 years,” concluding, “...the overall pattern is one of stagnation mixed with unambiguous decline” (italics added for emphasis). Further data shows that some of the very organs smoke targets—lungs and hearts—are already in worse shape among low-income folks: people in poor neighborhoods breathe more hazardous particles. And the buck—or lack of bucks—doesn’t stop there. According to research by the U.S. Census Bureau, pollution now is linked to widening existing economic rifts as well as impairing the health and education level of future generations. Lastly, it’s no secret that in this country, poverty, substandard healthcare, and / or skin color are inexorably linked— especially in or near cities. (That italicized “or” means that if you’re Black, it doesn’t matter if you’re richer than the white guy in the waiting room next to you; statistically, he's likely to get better care than you will). Respirators (front); mask (in the blurry beyond). Oct. 1, 2021. © Hope Lourie Killcoyne In this example, instruments used to monitor ozone—yet another threat to compromised lungs—caused anything from “severe operational interference” to “irreversible damage to instrument components.” Wildfires in the U.S. are not new, but they are getting worse. Such is the case even more so in fire-scarred Australia, where politicians delaying “meaningful actions”—layered with a paucity of climate-change-attributed news coverage—meant that “each succeeding fire reinvigorated the opponents of environmentalism.” Here in the States, between 1983 and 2020, the area burned by western wildfires has increased nearly tenfold. One forest fire (so far)—the Bootleg Fire in Oregon—actually produced its own weather, “…triggering lightning and releasing enormous amounts of smoke.” The toxic twist of climate change ⇨ wildfires ⇨ high levels of air pollution has even generated a new term: “smoke wave.” It’s not just the U.S., and it’s not just wildfires. The whole world should be worrying. A clear, compelling, and dire report from the United Nations is covered in the New York Times: A Hotter Future Is Certain, Climate Panel Warns. But How Hot Is Up to Us. The IPCC—which has been urging action since 1990… perhaps before you were born?—issued this report detailing the urgent need for immediate mitigating action. You can check out how any place on the planet is doing using their interactive atlas. April 22, 2021 © Hope Lourie Killcoyne Despite being wedged in a garbage can, a bright green Fuck Apathy sign stands tall in New York City’s Washington Square Park. Does its placement send you any message? Irony? Confusion? Motivation? Like the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center, nothing is invincible. It is far easier to destroy than it is to create. But here’s a very important point: destruction happens not only as direct, planned, and violent activity; but by indirect, unplanned, and passive inactivity. Right. By doing nothing. Therefore, our best shot at forestalling if not blocking further damage is by uniting and making change happen; we must rebel against the status quo. Remember: borders mean nothing to fire and smoke. What is required to put out fires? Action. And action is precisely what must be used to prevent them. The more proactive we are in preventing damage, the less reactive we’ll have to be.

Support the Rebellion Eco-anxiety (also known as climate anxiety) is a persistent sense of dread about experienced or anticipated ecological losses that affects daily life. The condition has been studied for more than a decade. But it is only in the last few years, with movements like XR increasing public awareness of the crisis, that eco-anxiety has received widespread academic attention. It’s important to understand that suffering from eco-anxiety is not a sign of mental illness. Many mental health professionals consider it a rational response to the world we currently find ourselves in. The same goes for the linked conditions of eco-anger and ecological grief. They demonstrate empathy for all the life being lost, and courage in facing up to the reality of the climate crisis. Activism is a wonderful way to meet like-minded people and channel your eco-anxiety into action. Photo: Simone J Rudolphi It’s also important to understand that eco-anxiety will affect people in very different ways. Our direct experience of the crisis, our personal history and vulnerabilities, and other factors will define the severity of its symptoms. Common indicators of eco-anxiety include sleeplessness, apathy, appetite changes, obsessive thoughts, a reluctance to have children, anger (particularly at people who don't acknowledge the climate crisis), sadness, grief, and panic attacks. The condition can also trigger positive behaviours, like seeking out information, caring for local natural spaces, and protest. Activism is tough. We have to look after each other to avoid burnout. Photo: Mark Richards Whatever your lived experience of eco-anxiety, it’s important that you find ways to share your feelings in a safe setting so you can manage them day-to-day. Below are five steps to help you do this, and if you want to learn more, or seek professional support, check out the resources in Must Reads. 31 OCT | Sweden A rebel at Malmö airport stands in the runway to stop a flight. On the first day of COP26, XR Sweden organised their biggest national action ever: blocking flights at eight airports all over the country! Some activists climbed fences and glued themselves onto the airstrip, others glued themselves to the nose of the plane, and some boarded planes as passengers and refused to sit down. The action targeted domestic flights within Sweden. The Swedish government uses taxpayers' money to heavily subsidise the aviation industry each year, enabling the dumping of plane ticket prices and making it near-impossible for trains and buses to compete. A rebel glues herself to the nose of an airplane at an airport close to Stockholm. Dozens of local XR groups across Sweden pulled together for the action, forming affinity groups, sharing knowledge, and strengthening each other with collective resolve. Together we stand strong! Still, it was a lonely experience walking up to a plane on the runway, as one rebel involved in the blockade at Ängelholms airport confirms; “I was all alone and in the dark. I was nervous and had anxiety for a week in advance. But sitting on the airstrip I just felt relieved and happy, I managed to stop the destruction for a little while.” As soon as the action began, the air traffic control tower, airport security, and police were contacted to ensure the safety of everyone involved. At the same time, rebel teams held protests and dropped banners inside and outside the targeted airports to alert the public. Rebels outside Halmstad airport. The banner: ‘Stop subsidizing flying’. In total, 14 rebels managed to keep ten airplanes on the ground before being arrested by the police. One rebel was wrestled to the ground and is still suffering nerve damage in one hand because the handcuffs were fastened so tightly. All those arrested now face a possible four-year prison sentence for suspected ‘air traffic sabotage‘. In spite of this, the rebels are proud of what they achieved. One said “we knew the risks and we know why we are doing this. If they send me to prison, I’m ready for it.” The action attracted a lot of media attention. It was covered live on the news throughout the day and picked up by some international media. The coverage led to multiple invitations for XR Sweden to write articles and hold interviews stressing the severity of the climate crisis. 16 - 18 NOV | Copenhagen, Denmark A 50-strong rebel alliance that included activists from XR Denmark, Collapse Total, and Shale Must Fall flooded the Scandinavian headquarters of Total and managed to confront the oil company’s executives. While others sat down and locked-on in the lobby, 20 activists jumped the turnstiles and headed for the top floor where Total’s management were having a meeting. One rebel confronted an executive over the company’s appalling legacy of funding climate denialism despite knowing about climate change since 1971. His response was to repeatedly request that the discussion continue downstairs. A Total executive debates tactics with a rebel intruder harnessed to a stairwell. With some intruders harnessed to stairwells and glued to windows, it took around 3 hours for police to clear the offices. All 20 were arrested and released later that night, with criminal prosecutions and hefty fines expected. The one non-Danish arrestee received their $400 fine early. The spicy action had come as a surprise to both the oil company and the police. The day before the rebel alliance had held a calm demonstration outside the building, with 50 activists singing chants and listening to testimonials of those affected by Total’s extractivism in the Global South. The expectation was that would be the end of it. Activists blockade the lobby of Total’s Scandinavian headquarters. The day after the occupation, the rebel alliance returned one last time to cover the building’s windows with activist statements and declarations to continue the fight against the fossil fuels industry. The occupation was part of a week of global actions targeting the French oil and gas giant (see Newsletter XTRA for more). After the failure of COP26 to rein in the industry, Total is aggressively expanding its operations around the world, including drilling and fracking in Argentina, Colombia, Namibia and Uganda. The rebel alliance wants the company to know that this is just the beginning. They will not stop until Total’s collapse. 4 DEC | Cape Town, South Africa: Rebels across the country demand Shell stop its destructive seismic survey of the Wild Coast to find more oil and gas. 4 DEC | Belgrade, Serbia: Rebels join thousands of people to swarm a major highway. There have been major protests across the country against a government-backed plan to allow Rio Tinto to mine lithium there. 3 DEC | Bern, Switzerland: A Swiss father has been on hunger strike since November 1st to compel the Swiss Parliament to accept proper training from climate scientists. He has already lost more than 17 kg. Help pressure the government to accept his simple demand. 1 DEC | Khartoum, Sudan: Rebels arrested a few weeks ago during a peaceful protest against the military coup have been released. All were tortured and tragically one rebel, Muhammad, was murdered by the military during the protest. 1 DEC | North Queensland, Australia: A Frontline Action Against Coal activist suspended himself from machinery at Adani’s North Queensland Export Terminal for 10 hours. He was arrested, charged with four offences, and released on bail. In November Blockade Australia disrupted trains to the terminal for 11 days. Expect more detailed coverage in a future issue. 29 NOV | India: After more than a year of giant protests, and over 700 deaths, the Indian parliament has finally repealed three farm laws that opened up the sector to privatisation. 26 NOV | UK, Netherlands, Germany: To mark Black Friday, rebels blockaded 15 Amazon fulfilment centres across Europe, the vast majority of those in the UK. Amazon was targeted because of the major role it plays in driving overconsumption, exploiting workers, and more. Photos: Alex Street (top right), Yaz Ashmawi (bottom right) 26 NOV | Washington DC, USA: Rebels also held inventive actions worldwide to highlight the perils of overconsumption on Black Friday - like holding this gruesome zombie wedding. 24 NOV | Wet’Suet’En/British Columbia, Canada: Militarised police use guns, dogs, axes and a chainsaw to arrest peaceful indigenous protestors disrupting a gas pipeline being built across their land. 32 were arrested, including 3 journalists and 3 legal observers. 18/24 NOV | Morocco/Kosovo: Add two more pins to the XR world map! A big welcome to XR Morocco and XR Kosovo. We look forward to featuring you in future issues. 20 NOV | Athens, Greece: Rebels attend the wedding of the European Commission with the fossil fuel lobby (the Greek government was best man). Earlier the happy couple announced they’d be making new fossil fuel infrastructure in Greece together. 18 NOV | Rejkyavik, Iceland: Rebels place empty shoes outside their parliament to mourn those killed by climate change and demand their government declare a climate emergency. So many rebel actions happened this month, we can’t fit them all into this newsletter. Head over to Newsletter XTRA to find out about actions in West Papua, Russia, DRC, NZ, the French Alps, and more. Newsletter XTRA: A feast for the eyes and extra fuel for the soul!

It was a big three days for our Third Demand. XR Global Support Participatory Democracy (XR GS PartDem), a small team striving to implement Citizens’ Assemblies on climate around the world, was nominated for a major award by the Council of Europe. The group’s work was selected from hundreds of initiatives to be analysed in a ‘laboratory’ at the World Democracy Forum, and was one of three to be shortlisted for the Democracy Innovation Award. Although they ultimately came a close second, rebel representatives convinced scientists, charmed civil society organisations, rallied the youth, and even gained support from policy-makers and parliamentarians. Bosnian rock band Dubioza kollektif closed the official ceremony by playing the ancient Italian protest song Bella Ciao. Everyone dropped formal protocol and danced like wild! The Regenerative Action Cycle courtesy of XR Barcelona.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/12/10/newsletter-xtra-59/,"Welcome to Newsletter Xtra where all the wonderful rebel actions we couldn’t fit into the main Global Newsletter come to stay. This month Newsletter Xtra brings you reports from West Papua, Russia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, New Zealand, Washington DC, the French Alps, and many more… A rally in West Papua in support of the Green State Vision NOV | West Papua: The West Papuan independence movement wants to make ecocide a crime and is calling for international help to save its rainforest. The interim president of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua Provisional Government (ULMWP), said: “Indonesia tried to build development on the bones of our people. The international community must stop the genocide and ecocide of my people in order to protect planet earth. If not, the rainforest will be destroyed by Indonesia.” He was launching the independence movement’s plan for a ‘green state’, where ecocide is a crime and indigenous people have guardianship of natural resources. West Papuan leaders are in exile from their homeland, which is half the island of New Guinea, home to the world’s third largest rainforest after the Amazon and the Congo. The Indonesian military seized West Papua in 1963. The indigenous people are Melanesian and are ethnically distinct from the people of Indonesia 3 DEC | Brussels, Belgium. In a landmark event the Belgian parliament voted by a huge majority (96 to 39) to recognise Ecocide as an international crime. The resolution - proposed by a Green member of parliament (above) - calls on the Belgian government to initiate a treaty of countries willing to prosecute ecocide and to propose an amendment to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court of The Hague to include the new crime. 27 NOV | Russia. Two friends and climate activists from Moscow held their own climate strike against the Russian government for continuing to develop its oil, gas and coal industry, risking people’s well-being and ignoring the climate crisis. 9 NOV | Rutshuru, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Activists from XR Rutshuru, a town in the east of the DRC near the border with Uganda and Rwanda, demonstrated against drilling by French oil giant Total in the Virunga National Park, a world heritage site. They said: “Beyond the war, the threats linked to the exploitation of natural resources in Virunga constitute another ordeal on the lives of local residents.” 19 NOV | Kenya. A marine scientist (left) on week 52 of her climate strike. 4 DEC | Dunedin, New Zealand. Rebels blockaded and climbed onto the roof of a train carrying coal from a local mine. After six hours the line was cleared. Eight were arrested. 16 NOV | Colombian embassies in France, Italy, Spain, Germany. Rebels demonstrated outside the Colombian embassy in several European cities to denounce the Colombian government’s failure to oppose the Drummond open-pit coal mine on the ancestral territory of the Yupka people. In January both the current and the former president of the Colombian subsidiary of the American coal giant Drummond were charged with complicity in gross human rights violations. 19 NOV | Lake Victoria, Uganda. ""A climate crisis is a water crisis,"" say the rebels from XR Uganda Great Lakes as they stand in the waters of Lake Victoria. 19-20 NOV | Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa. Plans to drill for oil off South Africa’s Wild Coast in KwaZulu-Natal led to demonstrations against the Shell oil company in Cape Town (top) and the South African energy and oil company Sasol in Johannesburg. The Cape Town protesters, including local rebels, Oceans Not Oil, and the Green Connection, were there to meet the Amazon Warrior, a seismic blasting vessel hired by Shell to carry out a seismic assessment in search of oil and gas off the Wild Coast. 21-22 NOV | Berlin, Germany, and Toulouse, France. As part of the worldwide Collapse Total campaign (see story in main Newsletter), rebels rallied outside the Total headquarters in Berlin (top) and demonstrated outside the Court of Appeal in Toulouse (above). 19 NOV | Washington DC, USA. That pink boat keeps getting in the way! Rebels blocked a main highway into the centre of the US capital “because the government is blocking climate progress”. The placard in the photo above refers to Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia who has millions of dollars invested in the coal industry and who has blocked real progress on Biden’s climate plans. 22 NOV | London, UK. Ocean Rebellion took action at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as delegates arrived for a Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting. 'Oil heads' representing oil industry lobbyists vomited ‘oil’ and threw ‘dirty money’ outside the entrance. 30 NOV | Haute-Savoie, France. Rebels from Annecy camped day and night for two weeks in the Bois de la Colombière at La Clusaz. They were trying to halt construction of a giant hill reservoir largely intended for making artificial snow. 30 NOV | Truro, UK. Cornish rebels protested Cornwall Council’s plan to subsidise internal flights to Newquay Airport instead of 5 community leisure centres and their swimming pools which are likely to close because of pandemic-induced financial problems. The ‘Earth not Space’ placard refers to Richard Branson’s intention to turn Newquay Airport into a spaceport. Photo: Ilya Fisher 3 DEC | The Netherlands. Dutch rebels occupied the headquarters of the country’s second largest pension fund, PFWZ,, to demand that it stops investing 4 billion euros in fossil fuels. The action follows the announcement in October that Holland’s largest pension fund, ABP, would no longer invest in the sector and would sell €15bn of holdings by first quarter of 2023. 26 NOV | Berlin, Germany.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/11/16/global-newsletter-58/,"An indigenous woman comforts a weeping Red Rebel in Glasgow during COP26. In this issue: DRC Rebels | Nigeria Rebels | Ecuador Rebels | Glasgow COP Rebellion Dear rebel, After all the fanfare, COP26 has failed. Not one of the G20 nations, the richest and most culpable for this crisis, will cut emissions to keep global heating even close to 1.5C. Global South nations have not been given the promised funds to rebuild from and defend against the extreme weather that already devastates their lands and people. Fossil fuel infrastructure will continue to expand and governments will continue to rig markets to encourage it. On all fronts, yet again, the can has been kicked down the road. Next year, we are promised, will be different. Next year real progress will be made. A Nigerian activist in Glasgow talks about how oil drilling has destroyed Africa for decades. Half a world away, another convention that will define our climate has also just finished. But this one, held in Cape Town, has been a roaring success. Africa Energy Week is a networking event designed to accelerate deals between regional governments and global fossil fuel companies. Africa is full of untapped oil and gas reserves. Contracts are being signed and vast infrastructure is being built to get it. African governments need to bring their people out of fuel poverty. Agreements should be in place to push renewables, and compensate them for keeping their fossil fuels in the ground. Instead, the fossil fuel industry sent more delegates to COP than any country, escaped binding restrictions, and is free to plunder, pollute, and profit as usual. Rebels march through the city of Butembo, DRC, to stop Virunga Park being drilled for oil. African rebels are bravely trying to push back against this suicidal system. In Action Highlights you can read about protests across the DRC, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. You can also find out how unfettered extractivism is causing ecocide and genocide in Ecuador and Brazil. Despite hosting another week of beautiful COP26 actions that championed Global South activists, Scottish rebels are angry. Understand why in COP Action Highlights. Our last issue was so stuffed with Global South action that we had technical problems sending it out. To those who received it twice, apologies. To those who never read it at all, why not check your junk mail folder, or read it on our website. Blood spills outside the Blue Zone on the last day of COP26. Photo: Max Withey The rallying cry of COP26 was to keep 1.5 alive. But the G20 leaders have left it to die, and instead breathed new life into the fossil fuel industry. The human cost of their negligence is terrifying to contemplate. These so-called leaders do not just have blood on their hands, they have it up to their waists. They wade through it. If they are not stopped, they will drown in it. For the good of all life, we must somehow wrestle power away from them. Get involved in XR wherever you are!

Support the Rebellion 4 - 10 NOV | North and South Kivu, DRC Rebels dance in a market in Shasha to highlight the issue of food insecurity. While world leaders met at COP26, rebels across the DRC demonstrated in food markets, outside mining companies, in areas affected by deforestation, and in villages abandoned after floods and landslides. Across the provinces of North and South Kivu, rebels headed to local markets to increase awareness about how the climate crisis threatens food production. Food insecurity already affects over 26 million people in the DRC. One major cause of food insecurity in the DRC is deforestation. Worryingly, recent estimates suggest that deforestation of the Congo Basin - the second-largest rainforest in the world, and a key CO² captor – is accelerating. XR Hewa Bora calls for recognition of the communities displaced by deforestation. XR Hewa Bora, formed by a group of displaced Bambuti hunter-gatherers, have first-hand experience of the impact of deforestation. Demonstrating near the old Mugunga Refugee Camp in North Kivu, they drew attention to the communities who have been forced from their forest homes by agriculture, mining and logging. Rebels in the same region also staged protests in villages abandoned due to flooding. Torrential rains have caused repeated flooding and landslides across the country, and more than 44,000 people were displaced in just the first half of 2021 alone. The rebels’ message to the leaders of COP26: Stop killing us! Rebels in Shasha demand a local mining company does more to protect the environment. There were rallies against fossil fuels in two major cities that border Virunga National Park - a World Heritage Site that has long been coveted by oil companies. Rebels in Goma and Butembo demanded that the government cancel licenses for oil extraction. The park is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world, and has drawn in armed militias, poachers and corrupt officials as oil companies like Total have lobbied to drill there. At least 200 park rangers have been murdered in the decade-long struggle. XR DRC intends to keep mobilizing local communities who are being directly impacted by the climate crisis, and to keep calling their own government, as well as the industrialized countries who have caused this crisis, to account. 27 OCT - 10 NOV | Nigeria XR Muslims Nigeria hold a workshop with the farmers and fishermen of Tsidir. A live music concert. A march through town. Interviews with struggling farmers. A meeting with journalists to encourage better reporting of the climate emergency. Nigerian rebels used an array of tactics to make their voices heard during COP26. Large parts of northern Nigeria are being ravaged by desertification and drought. Communities are moving south in search of clean water and food, causing clashes between roaming cattle herders and farmers, and leaving millions displaced from their ancestral homes. Rebels march (and dance) through Makurdi city to reduce waste and promote recycling. Meanwhile in the northwestern town of Tsidir, people are suffering from increasing floods. XR Muslims Nigeria gathered farmers and fishermen in the community to discuss the impacts of the chaotic weather and hear their demands of the leaders in Glasgow. In the northern city of Kaduna, rebels held a roundtable with local journalists to increase their understanding of the climate crisis. They also urged the press to hold the government to account when it came to environmental protections and investments in renewable energy. Rebels dance in the streets of ‘Coal City’ to promote a ‘Climate Music Concert’. Rebels joined with other climate activists in the southeastern city of Enugu (known as the Coal City because of its long history with coal mining) to hold a live street concert featuring upcoming local musicians. A rebel organizer explained: “we are using the power of music to gather people together, especially young people, to engage them in this global fight for climate justice”. Rebels in Enugu also set up a community COP26 viewing centre. Locals without internet access could watch the world leaders as they made decisions that will determine Nigeria’s future. 6 NOV | Freetown, Sierra Leone Rebels and school children sing and dance beside a busy junction in Freetown. Rebels and other local activists blocked off a main junction in Sierra Leone’s capital to demand the reintroduction of a ban on logging, and for the Global North leaders at COP26 to repay the Global South for the egregious costs of their emissions and extractivism. Rebels and local school children sang songs and danced in front of placards and artwork. They also gave interviews to local media. The country has long been plagued by logging, as well as diamond and rare-earth metal mining. The land grabbing and pollution from these industries has left many citizens without adequate nutrition, and indigenous wildlife facing extinction. A school girl is interviewed by local media after being part of a rebel rally in Freetown. A decade-long ban on timber exports was recently lifted by the government to make up for a fall in mining revenues. The nation’s rosewood forests are coveted by China, but slow-growing and still heavily depleted. XR Sierra Leone is determined to nurture a future generation of climate leaders in the country. It is working with groups like the ‘Sierra Leone School Green Club’ to educate young people about the environment and get climate material into the national curriculum. 7 & 12 NOV | Quito, Ecuador On a busy road of the capital, a rebel talks about how extractivism in Ecuador must end. XR Ecuador marched down United Nations Avenue in a ‘Fiesta con Conciencia’ (Party with Conscience) to show their disgust at the lack of progress being made at COP26. Dressed in bright colours and playing loud music throughout, rebels celebrated their country while showing solidarity with a local anti-mining campaign that is trying to halt several mining projects in the area. They had a simple message for rich countries: “Ecuador is not your petrol station, it is not your mine, it is not your trash bin, it is not your exotic pet shop, it is not your sawmill, it is not your discount shop”. Rebels present problems and solutions outside the Ministry of Agriculture. Their next appointment was at the Ministry of Agriculture, where rebels presented five complaints about the farming system in Ecuador, and also offered five solutions. Problems highlighted included the ecocidal impacts of excessive pesticide use, human rights abuses (including child labour) by the banana industry, deforestation by the soy and palm oil industries, and the polluting of indigenous lands and rivers by World Bank-financed livestock factory farms. Solutions included subsidies to support agroecological producers and the promotion of the switch to a plant-based diet. 7 / 12 NOV | São Paulo / Fortaleza, Brazil The Red Rebel Carpideiras weep at a funeral for Brazilian biodiversity in Sao Paulo. Rebels held a theatrical funeral for Brazilian biodiversity in a major road of one of the busiest cities in the world. Red rebels took on the role of carpideiras (women traditionally hired to cry at funerals) as they poured blood over animal effigies and wept as they ‘buried’ them. Other rebels handed out flyers to bemused passersby about the meat industry. Cattle ranching is responsible for 80% of the deforestation in the Amazon, and most of the beef it produces is exported to other countries. Fires used to clear the forest for farming have affected 90% of all species living there, and under Brazil’s current administration these fires are only increasing. The Amazon biome is now emitting more CO2 than it is absorbing. Rebels & indigenous people protest together in Fortaleza and remember those recently lost. Days later, in the northeastern city of Fortaleza, rebels and indigenous protestors joined for a rally and vigil on a beachfront. Those assembled called for an end to both the genocide of indigenous people and the destruction of their lands. Portraits were held up of indigenous people recently lost to the coronavirus pandemic. Their names were spoken during a vigil where candles were placed around the Iracema Statue. 7 - 13 NOV | Glasgow, Scotland COP is over and Scottish rebels are angry. Angry at the conference delegates who chose greenwashing over action. Angry at the heavy-handed policing that left protestors intimidated and actions cancelled when venues were threatened with closure. Angry that the media still grants COP legitimacy after three decades of failure. To all of them, they say ‘get tae fuck’ (translation: go away). But to those angry Scottish rebels, we should hold nothing but gratitude. They gave every last ounce of energy, creativity, love and rage to pull off a second week of dazzling actions that brought movements together and amplified those on the frontline of the climate crisis. An indigenous woman talks of her people's battles with extractivism. Photo: Gareth Morris Indigenous leaders and Amazon Rebellion teamed up to highlight the desperate struggle of rainforest defenders. As their speeches were translated into English, an indigenous woman wiped away the tears of an overwhelmed Red Rebel. Corporations plunder indigenous lands while their governments look away (or in Brazil’s case, encourage it), and the Global North imports the spoils while complaining that the Amazon is on the verge of collapse. Canadian West Coast indigenous people spoke about their resistance to the Trans Mountain pipeline, and the connections between the climate crisis and violence against indigenous women. Red dresses representing the missing and murdered women were hung on the outer fence of the COP convention centre. Amazon Rebellion was also involved in a blockade outside the offices of Santander. Two rebels lay in a bathtub of fake blood to protest the bank’s funding of deforestation. They locked themselves to an oil barrel to ensure bath time would be extensive. Another rebel spray painted ‘Blood Money’ on the front of the building. All three were arrested. Rebels dance to Killer Driller (based on Thriller) for some undeadly ‘disco-bedience’. In a day of action that incorporated singing, dancing, marching, and smashing up a car with hammers (it was a performance), activists from across Africa spoke about how Global North-backed oil projects have devastated their nations. Rebels also heard how vital compensation for loss and damage was to the nations already suffering from Global Heating. Around 150 rebels staged a die-in outside the offices of asset-management firm Mercer, owned by one of the world’s most powerful climate deniers. And finally a coalition of activists including rebels managed to get inside the COP26 Green Zone and disrupt a panel discussion hosted by National Grid. The group stormed the stage to call out the greenwashing energy company for importing vast amounts of fracked gas. XR Scotland provided emergency accommodation and held actions outdoors at the last minute after police threats led venues to cancel bookings. Help them recover costs. 2 NOV | Dakar, Senegal: XR Senegal held a workshop on biodiversity with local school children. The country was once the breadbasket of West Africa, known for its fertile soils and vast forests. But after decades of illegal logging the regional ecology is devastated and food insecurity is becoming a serious crisis. 6 NOV | Oslo, Norway: Rebels dressed as delegates play party games rather than agree on a proper climate agreement. Banners unfurled down the opera house as part of the action. 7 NOV | Banjul, Gambia: Rebels call for climate action on the busiest road in the capital. 8 / 10 / 12 NOV | Zanzibar / Kibaha / Pwani, Tanzania: XR Tanzania joins with other local groups to plant trees and march with both school children and students. 8 NOV | Berlin, Germany: An installation with quotes from people from the global south. Later a die-in was held. In Hamburg, meanwhile, rebels were gluing themselves to roads. 9 / 12 NOV | Limbe, Cameroon: Rebels organise a beach clean up, protest outside three petrol stations, and later plant fruit trees at a primary school. 10 NOV | Bangladesh: Young activists from ‘Save Future Bangladesh’ put themselves in a symbolic prison created by the failure of world leaders to end fossil fuel use at COP26. 10 NOV | Italy, Australia, UK: Lone rebels blockade streets around the world at 11am as part of a global Rebellion of One. 11 NOV | San Francisco Bay, USA: Hundreds of rebels join with other climate justice groups to march through the city. ""Xtractors"" lead the way - malfunctioning figures who represent the dystopian instability of extractive capitalism. Photo: Lev Schlaffer 12 NOV | Helsinki, Finland: 65 rebels occupy a central square to protest COP26. After a couple of police warnings to disperse, 15 protesters were arrested and taken away in vans. 13 NOV | London, UK: Rebels disrupt the Lord Mayor’s parade in the City of London (the heart of UK fossil fuel investment). Police made arrests. Photo: Immo Klink My friends and I were busy with activism in Gambia when we became aware of Extinction Rebellion on social media. I was so interested, I thought it was amazing. As activists we wanted to make things move but it wasn’t happening, so myself and three friends founded XR Gambia in September 2019. We took many actions - marches, public talks, school and community outreach, street chalkivism, die-ins - and we have grown to 27 rebels. The media does not like to publish the facts but I talk about climate science in schools. As a result of XR Gambia, the young people are becoming more aware of the climate crisis. Sadly, I think there is still a general perception that climate change is just a natural circumstance. I find comfort in taking part in actions. We go onto the streets and tell the truth to people. Even if we have no funds, we improvise using waste sacks and disposable cartons to make posters. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and increasing temperatures are threatening my country. We have good flora and fauna which continues to be annihilated. It is so clear, so alarming and the science is there to follow. I don’t know why people are not acting. I think the big corporations are making so much money that they are happy to put profit over planet. They hide the facts as they destroy the future, making everything bad, but I hope things are getting better. I have made many friends as a result of my activism - we are becoming more connected, we share the facts. I believe we can still break through. I’m a senior school teacher but have gone back to University to study the environment, english language and communication. I secured a scholarship with an environmental body but it didn’t work out, so I am funding myself. I will gather this knowledge so I have more impact. I don’t want to stop campaigning. I will continue. Activism is working - slowly slowly slowly - but it is working.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/11/09/global-newsletter-57-cop-special-1/,"Protestors from all over the globe march together outside COP26. Photo: Gareth Morris In this issue: Africa Rebels | COP-acabana in South America | Glasgow’s Mega Marches Dear rebel, The first week of COP26 is over and the signs are not good. So far, this conference has not been the climate gamechanger promised by politicians and promoted by the media. Each day brings a new pledge that looks like progress. But none are legally binding, few have stood up to scrutiny, and many offer so much wiggle room as to be meaningless. The reality is that global carbon emissions are rapidly rising again after a Covid-induced slump, and rich nations are letting oil companies steer their decarbonisation strategies. We are not heading towards a brave new world, just using smallprint and tech-fixes to hold onto the old one. A young UK rebel has the right message during the Global Day for Climate Justice. In his opening speech to world leaders, the British prime minister likened their task in Glasgow to James Bond defusing a doomsday device. But the truth is that most of these leaders (not all) act like Bond villains, happy to watch the world burn rather than relinquish any of their ill-gotten power and prestige. But we will not be picking over the puffed up promises of serial underachievers in this newsletter. Instead our focus will be on the glorious wave of COP-inspired rebellion that has swept across the Global South. Africa and South America, regions that have long suffered the effects of extractivism and global heating, and have the most to lose from the grandstanding in Glasgow, have risen up like never before. Loving rage now courses from Kenya to Colombia, from Egypt to Argentina, and you can read all about it in Global South Action Highlights. Rebels in Tanzania march to raise awareness about the climate crisis. Authorities made them remove their XR banners. Loving rage has also been swirling around the COP conference itself, with rebels arriving from all over the world to take part in daily collective actions alongside folks from other movements. Find out more about the very best bits in COP Action Highlights. You can also catch up on the wave of national rebellions that happened last month. Read a shocking report about police violence in the Netherlands, and how the Spanish Rebellion got unprecedented media coverage, in Rebellion Wave. You can see some of the beautiful COP solidarity actions that have been taking place across every continent in Action Roundup. And finally, a rebel has somehow managed to burrow themselves into the conference centre and sent us a Postcard From COP. A rebel from XR Vaal in South Africa has a simple message for her state power company. We’ve never delivered a global newsletter more action-packed than this, and we’re only just getting started. Another COP-crammed issue will be with you at the same time next week. As phoney pledges ring out, and global politics plummets to new lows, global rebellion reaches new heights and new corners of the globe. This is what progress actually looks like. Get involved in XR wherever you are! Check out our global website, learn more about our movement, and connect with rebels in your local area. The Global Newsletter is brought to you by XR Global Support, a worldwide network of rebels that help new XR chapters grow. Read previous issues here. We are in a crucial phase of human history, and we need money to make our message heard. Anything you can give is appreciated. Support the Rebellion 23 OCTOBER | Kisumu County, Kenya XR Kisumu stand in the local market and hold up their ‘blood-soaked’ hands. When rebels and other activists set out on their 7km march across Kisumu County, they turned heads. They were flanked by acrobats, played upbeat music, and danced. But this was no carnival. The banner they carried read ‘Stop Killing Us.’ This was a rallying cry against the systematic exclusion of African countries from climate negotiations, and a demand for climate justice from those bearing the brunt of the crisis. The rebels attracted so much attention as they journeyed through their local market that even some passing motorcyclists joined the march. But the rebellion nearly never happened. In the days running up to it, the organisers received constant threats of police brutality. One rebel noted how climate activism could “easily get you killed,” citing the recent murder of Joannah Stutchbury, who campaigned against plans to build on a Kenyan national park. Rebels stay light-hearted despite the dangers of climate activism in Kenya. As well as fearing for their safety, rebels also faced incomprehension. “The majority of people don’t understand why you are making noise about something like greenhouse gas emissions,” said the rebel. They did their best to answer the questions of passersby. In the last few years, Kisumu County has been hit by both severe flooding and drought. The floods have left families homeless, farms ruined, and schools closed. Meanwhile the drought during this year’s farming season has left many local farmers facing the threat of starvation. Desperate rural communities have resorted to drawing water from contaminated sources, and disease is becoming more widespread. One rebel based in Kisumu all her life said: “The climate emergency is a crime against humanity perpetrated by the rich and powerful against the poor and vulnerable, especially of the Global South. Let COP26 be the moment we stop speaking and start acting.” 30 OCT / 6 NOV | Dar es Salaam, Tanzania Drummers lead the way through Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania. XR Tanzania went on a courageous march to raise awareness about the climate crisis and demand action at COP26. It wasn’t long before the police stopped it. They eventually allowed the march to continue, but with all banners removed to ‘keep the peace.’ Following discussions, XR have been granted permission for another march when banners will be allowed. The majority of the country’s population has no concept of climate change, and like many governments, promises to tackle the issue have not yet resulted in policies. Plastic pollution in Tanzania is a colossal problem. Plastic pollutants encourage the spread of pathogens such as cholera and malaria, contaminate food and water systems, and substantially reduce air quality when burnt, which is how many locals deal with the problem. Yet, no measures are taken against the major plastic polluters of the region; multinationals like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Pepsi-Co and Unilever, and local drinks producer Mo Enterprise. The poor have no voice in Tanzania, but they do have ears. XR Tanzania believes that once the knowledge is out there, people will start demanding better. XR Tanzania also organised a beach clean-up with young people for Global Action Day. 30 OCT | Muhanga City, Rwanda Rwandan rebels took to the streets to demand action from the Global North governments who are responsible for the climate crisis and its lethal effects on the Global South. They also performed a traditional dance and sang about conserving the nation’s forests, and the planet. Rebels stand in a suburb of Muhanga, Rwanda’s 2nd largest city. For the Rwandan people, the climate crisis is here and causing frequent devastation. Since 2018, the country has been experiencing extraordinary amounts of rainfall. That year, storms, floods, and landslides damaged hundreds of roads and bridges, displaced nearly 16,000 families, and killed 254 people. In the first four months of 2020, flooding and landslides displaced thousands more families and took at least 140 more lives. The extreme weather costs Rwanda nearly 10% of its national budget each year, and the losses hit rural communities, small-scale farmers, and low-income families the most. Rwanda is being courted by the oil industry for a major pipeline project across East Africa. XR Rwanda is calling for a new climate crisis fund to be financed by wealthy countries as well as by taxes on financial transactions, international air travel, and fossil fuels. Funds would be disbursed to both government and civil society organizations, especially the locally-based and women-led ones that can reach those most affected. XR Rwanda hopes COP26 will put a spotlight on those countries responsible for these climate disasters and trigger decisive action that addresses loss and damage. 30 OCT, 4 / 5 NOV | Iganga, Hoima, & Jinja, Uganda Rebels in Hoima, home to Uganda’s burgeoning oil industry, send a clear message to COP. Rebel groups across Uganda have launched distinct actions to draw attention to major environmental issues in their regions. In the eastern town of Iganga, rebels marched to raise awareness about water pollution caused by local steel factories. Families living near the factories are forced to inhale dense smoke, and factory waste floods the sewer system and spills into water sources. Many locals have to travel over half an hour to access safe drinking water. Some Iganga rebels wore masks for protection - activism can be dangerous in Uganda. Only half of Uganda’s people have basic access to safe drinking water, and a fifth are forced to drink from streams, ponds, and hand-dug wells, which are often contaminated due to the widespread absence of proper toilets and showers. The loss of vegetation, which acts as a natural filtration system, has increased water-related health issues. Nearly a quarter of deaths under the age of five in Uganda are a result of diarrhoea due to polluted water. To the west in Hoima, home to Uganda’s oil reserves and soon to house its only refinery, rebels called on COP26 leaders to leave fossil fuels in the ground, and called upon local leaders to stop the destruction of local forests. Trees are being felled for charcoal and timber at such a rate that conflicts between stressed wildlife and locals are increasing. XR Great Lakes stand in one of the region's many sugarcane fields. Finally, in the southern city of Jinja, which overlooks Lake Victoria, XR Great Lakes launched an awareness campaign about sugarcane and how its production in the wetland region is leading to food insecurity. The water-intensive crop remains in the soil all year long and is terrible for biodiversity. But money talks. Sugarcane is now a source for biofuels and bioplastics as well as food production, and the global market is booming. Sugar factories operate across the region, and local farmers are abandoning traditional food crops. The industrialisation of the area is leading to increased concrete cover and flooding, as well as increasing the threat of eutrophication in Lake Victoria. 7 NOV | Alexandria, Egypt Members of an Engineer club attended the workshop (alongside students and children). XR Egypt and local group Green Society Initiative held a workshop to inspire young and old Egyptians to fight for climate justice. The event was joint-led by a nuclear engineer and a visual artist, and the turnout was both large and multigenerational. Participants didn’t just sit and listen, they constructed puzzles together which depicted the multifaceted nature of the climate crisis, the array of solutions available (with a particular emphasis on nuclear energy), and the ways we as individuals can bring about change. Attendees solve a puzzle which depicts an area of the climate crisis. Many who hold political office in Egypt have indulged in climate denialism and action has been far too slow. XR Egypt believes that the delegates at COP26 need to abandon empty promises and begin a global transition to clean (specifically nuclear) energy. They also have plans for more awareness actions in their community soon. 29 OCT / 3 NOV | Johannesburg, South Africa Eskom uses coal to generate electricity, which pollutes the area and drives extraction. Activists from XR Vaal and Botle Ba Tlhaho Environmental Group want a just transition to renewable energy, and so they targeted state energy company Eskom, which uses coal to generate 90% of the nation’s electricity. A dozen rebels assembled outside Kwaggastroom train station to sing, wave banners, and demand that Eskom go renewable, or go to hell! Eskom is just one of many companies driving extraction in the Vaal triangle (an industrial area rich in natural resources). Acid mine drainage, air smog, and deforestation have been rife for decades. XR Vaal also held a protest against EACOP, a pipeline that will run hot crude oil across East Africa, oil drilling in the Okavango Delta, and other crimes by extractive industries. The region became an official government cleanup priority in 2007, but little has been done with taxpayer money since, and extractive industries have still not been held accountable. The fact that these industries remain one of the few reliable local sources of employment complicates the issue. This is why XR Vaal wants industry to decarbonise and usher in sustainable alternatives. Together with regenerative agriculture and reforesting, rebels believe that their region can heal from decades of extraction. 30 - 31 OCT | Buenos Aires, Argentina 27 OCT / 6 NOV | Bogotá, Colombia 5 NOV | Uberlândia, Brazil Music and passion were always the fashion at the Tierra Activa Festival, Buenos aires. Rebels in Buenos Aires hosted a weekend festival, the Tierra Activa, to mark the start of COP26. There was music, theatre, activities for children, and a citizens assembly at the end of each day. A special program of talks covered Argentina’s political inaction over the climate crisis, the government’s cosy relationship with multinational corporations, and the extractivism and indigenous persecution that has resulted. Mega dams have altered river flows and destroyed biodiversity. Mega-mining projects compete with communities in Catamarca, Jujuy, Mendoza and Chubut for water resources. Forests and wetlands are razed to make way for soya plantations and cattle ranches, and rivers are depleted to keep exports flowing. For the finale, the boxes broke open to reveal what was inside the leaders’ heads. The answer: money, toxic chemicals, and blood. Colombian rebels loaded with flyers, brushes and glue ran through the moonlit streets of Bogotá and pasted messages on banks, bus stops, and billboards to spread XR’s message and preview their next action (tagline: “The world is in flames and you are on vacation”). The action turned out to be a performance where world leaders treated COP like a holiday and mocked activists. “Colombian government representatives go to the COP with a very different goal than tackling the climate crisis”, said a rebel from XR Bogotá. “They go to do commercial diplomacy, meaning more fracking and more mega-mining”. XR Uberlândia and FFF come together to celebrate an action well done. Finally, Brazilian rebels and Fridays For Future activists distributed their own flyers to the car drivers of Uberlândia. The fossil fuel awareness campaign was launched during rush hour on the city’s biggest road, and finished with an artistic performance involving kayaks to show motorists how without decarbonised transportation, the city could end up underwater. 30 OCT - 6 NOV | Glasgow, Scotland A record-breaking week of protest started gently in Glasgow, with rebel pilgrimage groups wandering into the city after setting off from as far afield as Sweden, Germany and Poland. Waiting to welcome them was XR Scotland’s Blue Rebels, the Serpent of Capitalism (a giant 30m long sculpture), and a Samba band. Next to arrive were the Red Rebels, this time by train, and again the Blue Rebels were there to greet them. The two beautiful brigades joined in a silent and haunting procession around Glasgow Central station to celebrate. And while world leaders welcomed one another at a lavish opening dinner party, rebels joined other climate activists at a beggars banquet rally in a park just outside. Greta at the beggars banquet rally, the Serpent of Capitalism at the Pilgrim’s Procession, the greenwash march where police kettled 500, and suffragettes outside JP Morgan. With the welcomes out of the way it was time for a proper party. A Trillion Dollar Bash was held outside JP Morgan, the worst bank of them all when it comes to profiting from fossil fuels. But the vibes were so good that rebels had to move, so they marched to the “Squinty Bridge” outside the COP26 Blue Zone and occupied it. It was the first big march of many. The indigenous leaders of Minga Indigena marched to the conference centre with rebels alongside them, and demanded an end to offsetting and carbon trading - false solutions that will ensure the continued destruction of their communities. Minga Indigena are a coalition of Indigenous leaders from all over the world. A greenwashing march was joined by over 1000 activists, though half of them were kettled by overzealous police for two hours, and five lock-ons were arrested for barricading the HQ of Scottish energy company (and COP26 sponsor) SSE. Rebels showed solidarity with war and climate refugees on a march for peace, highlighting how the UK government spends more on weapons than climate solutions, how climate chaos will lead to more war, and how arms companies like BAE will profit from it. 30,000 joined the Youth Climate Strike March organised by Fridays For Future Scotland, and listened as Greta declared COP26 a failure. But the jewel in the marching crown came the next day, when a staggering 100,000 people coursed through Glasgow for the COP26 Global March. Scientist Rebellion chain themselves to King George V bridge then break records. It proved to be one of the largest protests in Glasgow’s history, and it wasn’t the only record made that day. Twenty-one scientists were arrested for occupying a bridge for three hours - the largest number of scientists ever arrested for a climate direct action!

Huānyíng! 25 OCT | NYC, USA: XR NYC and Sunrise Movement NYC blockade two highways during morning rush hour traffic. Rupert Murdoch wasn’t pleased. 27 OCT - 6 NOV | Melbourne, Australia: Victoria state is rebelling. Highlights include a rally outside parliament, a blockade of ExxonMobil, a bridge occupation, and a 4m tall screaming koala called Blinky who will haunt your dreams. 27 OCT - 4 NOV | Worcestershire, Southampton, London, UK: Rebels blockade the entrance to an Arms Fair, occupy an Exxon refinery due for expansion, hold a vigil outside the Bank of England for the Pacific Islands, and protest outside Standard Chartered bank.

Welcome to the rebellion! 30 OCT | Rome, Italy: Rebels had to contend with riot police as they blockaded roads and locked themselves to railings to disrupt the G20 summit that directly preceded COP26. 31 OCT | Stockholm, Sweden: Rebels boarded aircraft, sat on runways, and glued themselves to planes across the country. 8 flights in 8 airports were blocked. 1 NOV | Belgrade, Serbia: Rebels dressed as Shell, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and a ‘political leader’ burn planet Earth after a cycling protest that passed most major embassies. 5 NOV | Mexico City, Mexico: Rebels used graffiti, fake-blood, and chants to demand that ecocidal companies Bayer (pharmaceuticals) and Monsanto (agrochemicals) leave Mexico. 6 NOV | Seoul, South Korea: XR Korea stage an Earth Mukbang (Eating) Contest! Which multinational corporation do you think guzzled the most? 6 NOV | Brussels, Belgium: More than 250 rebels were arrested for trying to peacefully protest outside the Federal Parliament. 6 NOV | Lusaka, Zambia: Rebels take their COP26 message to the streets. 11 - 18 OCT | The Hague, Netherlands Rebels suffered brutal treatment from police over their week of rebellion, with female and non-binary rebels receiving the most aggression (Warning: linked videos are upsetting). One rebel was thrown into a police bus so violently they hit a window and passed out, another was beaten on the hand with a hammer, and still more rebels were violently detached from blockades, and dragged down the street, in some cases by the hair. A rebel chained to a log is aggressively detached by police. Photo: Frank van Deutekom XR Netherlands condemned the police crackdown and said violence should never be the answer to peaceful demonstrations. The rebellion launched with more than 700 brave rebels blockading a major intersection that lies right between the Dutch Parliament and its Ministry of Economics & Climate. Dozens of other rebels used tripods to occupy smaller locations around the capital. The police were present in large numbers, but at first the vibe was good. As the light faded though the police started violently herding together rebels, bystanders and journalists alike. 200 rebels were surrounded and 80 arrested and bundled into vans. The FLINTA brigade stands defiant in the political heart of the Netherlands. 150 brave rebels returned to occupy the same intersection the next day. This time the centre of the blockade was made up of FLINTA (Female, Lesbian, Intersex, Non-binary, Trans and Agender) rebels, and the police violence was instant. A FLINTA temple with a ‘toxic system’ roof propped up by columns representing patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism was immediately confiscated, while rebels were subject to brutal police intimidation, including being pulled to the ground by their hair. Rebels outside the HQ of a political party set to eventually form a coalition government. Dozens of rebels used glue, fake-blood, and determination to blockade the offices of the three political parties who are likely to form the nation’s next coalition government - and none of whom are willing to put much effort into climate policy. Another ten occupied the foyer of Dutch oil and gas lobby group, NOGEPA and demanded that they lobby instead for sustainable energy. The Netherlands has one of the highest per-capita CO2 emissions figures in the European Union and a government that has been happy to greenwash itself. XR is one of few environmental groups in the region trying to pressure the government into action. 18 – 25 OCT | Madrid, Spain Dancing in the streets, ministry occupations, guerilla advertising, and major traffic blockades--the rebellion in Madrid was a week to remember. It drew in rebels from all over Spain, as well as vans of police and daily press headlines. Around 50 rebels launched the rebellion in style with some drum-based 'discobedience', but then came three actions targeting the Spanish government. A young rebel takes part in a bloody performance outside Spain’s Congress Rebel scientists and academics denounced the political inaction around the climate crisis by pasting pages of the latest IPCC Assessment Report on the walls of the Ministry of Ecological Transition. They also sprayed “Red Alert” across the ground with fake blood. Four rebels chained themselves to the nearby Ministry of Foreign Affairs to demand Climate Justice for the Global South, and XR Youth put on a performance outside Congress to remind parliamentarians whose future is really at stake. Spain’s corporate sector was also targeted. Rebels cleverly hacked a giant bank advert in the city center, while around 50 members of Animal Rebellion Spain swarmed a McDonald’s to raise awareness about the cruelty of the meat industry. Passersby applauded and wanted to know more. XR Spain joined forces with Marea Deliberativa, a coalition of environmental and social groups, to launch a Climate Assembly in front of Spain’s national gallery of modern art, and highlight the major flaws of the official Spanish Climate Assembly. The final day blockade gathered rebels from all over Spain. Photo: @Mingo_Graphics A nationwide ‘Rebellion of One’ saw vulnerable rebels sit in busy roads not just in Madrid but in other cities including Valencia and Mallorca. As always, reactions were mixed, but when one rebel shouted he didn't want to be there, a pedestrian ran over to give him a hug. The rebellion closed with a 150-strong blockade of one of Madrid's busiest streets, with the crowd demanding that this COP be the last. The biggest action of the rebellion attracted ten van loads of police, who then used radial saws to cut free and arrest rebels who had locked themselves to a giant hourglass and pink oil drums. It also attracted unprecedented media coverage across Spain’s mainstream press and TV channels. 1 - 6 NOV | COP26, Glasgow, Scotland The planet’s yearly date with climate angst is halfway spent, and humanity’s tango with calamity plays out inside conference halls and out on the streets. Some 25,000 visitors from all corners of the Earth have descended upon Glasgow. Those visitors out on the streets mingle with local activists and engage in daily protests, culminating in Saturday’s huge march. Inside the conference sit the powerful world leaders and their negotiators, and this week they produced a series of agreements and pledges. Inside the COP26 Blue Zone, where world leaders come to negotiate. Photo: Ian Scoones There were a few (tepid) surprises, like India and Saudi Arabia’s unexpected commitments to net zero. Even though they fall short of the recommendations by the UN’s own experts at the IPCC, these announcements seem to give delegates and journalists a fleeting sense of hope. More than 100 nations pledged to cut global methane emissions by over 30% by 2030, and a forestry agreement promised to stop deforestation by the same year. Deals to curb the use of coal once and for all, and encourage divestment from fossil fuels, were also unveiled. But the glaring lack of policing mechanisms left a question mark hanging over all of it. These nations could easily promise the Earth while continuing to destroy it. Outside on the streets of Glasgow, where the city pulses with protest. Photo: Gareth Morris In general, the solutions presented at this COP never stray far from the path of “green capitalism”, and that is simply unacceptable to those visitors chanting outside. They call for an entire overhaul of the global economic system to avert the abyss we face. At least both sides can agree that it is an abyss we face. As the second week of COP begins, and protest blossoms across the world, it feels like the real value of this climate carnival lies not in its outcomes, but in the stage it sets for global voices to speak up. Scottish rebels young and old have done themselves proud while their nation hosts COP26. Our next issue is already shaping up to be something special, rebel.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/11/02/xrcop-XRTunisia-disaster-stop-pollution/,"During COP26 in Glasgow, XR Global is continuing to share global stories of climate and ecological injustice to underline the need for genuinely equitable and just outcomes from the conference if it is to have any meaningful impact. This piece explores the battle for safe living and working conditions in Tunisia through the eyes of corageous activists fighting back against polluting processes of industrialisation happening in the city of Gabès. The explosion at the chemical factory in Gabès. Raouf Ben Mohamed is an experienced and courageous environmental activist and organiser with Stop Pollution and Earth Fast, as well as an XR rebel. On Wednesday 17th March 2021, Raouf and members of Stop Pollution organised a large protest against the Tunisian Government rallying against government corruption, which activists argue led to the disaster at the chemical complex in Gabès. This is Raouf’s story of the disaster and the following days of protest. On Saturday 13th March 2021 an industrial disaster struck the city of Gabès in South-East Tunisia. A tank in an asphalt factory exploded, killing six people and injuring many more. Raouf stated that this is a new factory, having only been opened around six months to a year before the disaster. Since opening, the factory had been beset with many controversies, including serious lack of protective equipment for its workers. Protesters in Gabès holding a sign roughly translating to ‘Gabès in Pain, Asphalt mixed with Blood’. To make matters worse, the factory had no fire exits for the workers to use in an emergency, meaning when the fire took hold in the factory the fire service had to knock down walls to get workers to safety. The factory owner was accused of putting profit before workers’ safety. Raouf insists that the factory was allowed to operate despite violations of safety standards due to corruption and bribery. Right next to the factory is a warehouse with a stockpile of ammonium nitrate. This is the same chemical which caused the massive explosion in the city of Beirut, Lebanon in August 2020; damage from that explosion spread to a 6 mile radius, with shockwaves being felt around 100 miles away. Protesters at the rally organised by Stop Pollution. The stockpile of ammonium nitrate in Gabès is over four times the amount that was in Beirut. If this had ignited due to the factory explosion, then it would have caused untold damage to the city of Gabès - potentially costing many, many more lives. Fortunately, the ammonium nitrate did not explode, but people in Gabès believe they should never have been exposed to such a risk and that the Tunisian Government is not doing enough to protect them. A protester raises their fist during the Stop Pollution demonstration. Raouf and fellow members of Stop Pollution, many of whom are also members of Earth Fast, organised a demonstration in response to the disaster to remember the six lives tragically lost. Those gathered had four demands of the Government in the wake of the disaster: Hundreds of protesters turned up in Gabès to put pressure on the Government to meet these demands, marching through Gabès to the chemical complex, where Raouf gave an impassioned speech to the crowd. Raouf speaks to those assembled. During his speech he recited a poem about resistance and offered his condolences to the families of those tragically killed in the disaster. He stated that ‘the worst has happened’ and that they have now ‘reached the stage of death’ as a result of Government inaction and business owners putting profit before safety. He told the crowd that it was ‘not their destiny to live in a polluted environment’ and that they ‘have a right to work and a right to a clean environment.’ Haifa addresses the crowds. Raouf also spoke about the negative impact of the chemical complex on local employment: the complex employs three thousand workers while the industrial area as a whole is home to six thousand. However, since its creation, seventeen thousand jobs have been lost across the marine and agricultural sectors in the region. This move is part of a development strategy that activists see as unsustainable and a hindrance to real development in the region. Stop Pollution demands an environmentally friendly alternative which secures jobs and protects workers. Raouf went on to demand that the regional authority of Gabès resign, saying they no longer had legitimacy due to the explosion and their responsibility for severe pollution in the area. Demonstrators at the protest. The protesters chanted slogans demanding that the regional authority resign, and called for the prosecution of those responsible. They also called for an end to the greed of the capitalist system, which they see as driving pollution in the region at the expense of the Tunisian people. Raouf and Stop Pollution are continuing their protests in coalition with trade unions and environmental groups like Earth Fast. They are determined to continue until their demands are met, emphasising that solidarity in action will make a difference.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/10/20/Xrcop-xr-nigeria-world-water-day-benue-river/,"On March 22 countries across the globe marked World Water Day, an annual United Nations observance that stresses how important freshwater, and the sustainable management of it, is to our survival. The theme of World Water Day 2021 was ‘Valuing Water’ and XR rebels in Benue Valley, Nigeria, used the opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of freshwater locally. Freshwater is in abundance thanks to the Benue River, but many inhabitants do not have access to clean drinking water. Rebels also emphasised the responsibility local and national governments must take for providing people with access to safe water. According to WaterAid statistics, three in ten people in Nigeria do not have access to clean water close to home, three in five people don’t have a toilet of their own, while four in five people - around 170 million Nigerians - lack basic handwashing facilities. Young women carrying clean water back to their homes in Benue, Nigeria While shocking, these statistics are not anomalous; across the world, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water. Four billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month each year and the UN predicts that this situation will worsen without urgent action, with up to 5.7 billion living in water-scarce areas for at least one month a year by 2050. Water scarcity can be as a result of a physical shortage of water, or the failure of institutions to provide adequate infrastructure and regular supply. Climate breakdown is contributing to the former as extreme weather events become increasingly common. More frequent and extreme flooding pollutes water sources. This leads to people becoming sick as they are forced to rely on unclean water. Meanwhile droughts cause rivers and springs to dry up, often leading to crops failing, less produce, and so less for people to eat. Bart Shinyi (third from right) and other activists at the World Water Day event in Benue, Nigeria XR activists in Benue, Nigeria, including Bart Shinyi, carried out advocacy on the issue of water scarcity in their region on World Water Day. Gathering in various locations they spoke to local people about the importance of water for all aspects of life, focusing in particular on the issue of water-borne diseases. Governmental mismanagement of freshwater sources in the region has caused populations to rely on unsanitary sources, putting them at risk of illness. They discussed how improved water management would lead to more secure economic circumstances for households, as families would no longer have to rely on expensive medicines for the treatment of water-borne illnesses. Bart’s discussions also centred on the issue of climate breakdown. He emphasised how in the past, most rural villages and hamlets could access freshwater from local streams and rivers; but now, due to increasingly dry weather, many streams have dried up, leaving communities forced to travel long distances for water. Meanwhile, local governments are offering no long-term solutions to the issue. The sessions run by Bart and his colleagues included a question-and-answer segment designed to remind people not to contaminate the water around them. The main aim, though, was to raise awareness of the government’s responsibility to provide potable, treated water for communities. A large group of XR activists at another of the World Water Day sessions in Benue The activists are hopeful that the UN's COP26 climate conference in Glasgow this year will make more explicit the message that climate breakdown is responsible for water shortages and food insecurity in their region, and others across the world. It is hoped that COP26 will lead to improvements in the provision of safe drinking water and hygiene services in Nigeria. They believe it is essential that the conference marks a shift towards greater collective action and international policies to effectively mitigate the worst effects of climate change. However, the activists also remain conscious that local authorities are responsible for ensuring the fair and efficient distribution of water, and that pressure must continue to be placed on them to ensure that demand for water in all parts of Nigeria is met.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/10/15/global-newsletter-56/,"A Red Rebel takes the Milan Metro to get to the Pre-COP rebellion in the city’s centre. In this issue: Milan Pre-COP Rebellion | Swiss Rebellion | NYC Bank Block | Bogotá Mural Dear rebel, If climate change conferences were concerts, COP26 would undoubtedly be the biggest gig of the year. Pre-COP would be the warm-up act. As the name suggests, Pre-COP is a preparatory meeting where ministers from select countries have a final chance to shape the negotiations of the main event. They also briefly meet with the delegates of Youth4Climate, a youth conference that directly precedes the adult one. This year Pre-COP was held in Milan, and rebels from all over Italy converged on the city to denounce the decades of failure that the COP process represents. You can read about the five days of non-stop Pre-COP rebellion in Action Highlights. Police look on as rebels scale the gates of the Pre-COP conference in Milan, Italy. Milan wasn’t the only city to catch the rebellion wave this month. Zürich, New York and Bogotá also saw their streets swell with loving rage, and all are featured in this issue. COP26 is now just a matter of days away, and whether you want to rebel at the conference in Glasgow, take part in a solidarity action elsewhere, or donate funds to support the rebellion of others, this month’s Must Reads has all the links you need. With so much global rebellion planned over the two weeks of COP26, and the wave of national rebellions still surging (check out Upcoming Actions), the Global Newsletter team are planning two issues over November to contain it all. We can’t promise you political progress, but we will provide you with a double helping of pulse-racing protest. Greta addresses ministers at Youth4Climate Photo: Sky News At the Youth4Climate conference, Greta Thunberg delivered another brilliantly blunt speech to world leaders, castigating them for “30 years of blah, blah, blah.” All signs point towards COP26 being more blah, blah, blah. The coming COP rebellion will play a vital role in helping people realise that the summit process is broken, that their faith is better placed in Citizens’ Assemblies, and that the inaction of our politicians is nothing less than a Crime Against Humanity. COP may be the biggest gig of the year, but we’re all sick of hearing blah blah blah. The Global Newsletter is brought to you by XR Global Support, a worldwide network of rebels that help new XR chapters grow. Read previous issues here. We are in a crucial phase of human history, and we need money to make our message heard. Anything you can give is appreciated. Support the Rebellion 29 SEP - 3 OCT | Milan, Italy An ostrich, burying its head in the sand. This was the symbol chosen by rebels in Milan to represent twenty-six years of political denial in the face of the climate emergency. In the final set of ministerial meetings before COP26, representatives from over 40 governments gathered in Milan to prepare for the summit. But the Pre-COP talks were held behind closed doors; hidden in a convention centre away from the eyes and ears of the public. Flanked by a giant ostrich, rebels forced local traffic to a halt, pounded on the convention’s gates, and stained the ground with pools of fake blood. Rebels and a giant ostrich assemble outside the gates of the Milan Convention Centre. Sign: Ostriches hide the truth so the economic system doesn’t have to change. The Pre-COP rebellion began with an epic three-day journey. A caravan of rebels cycled the 200km from Turin to Milan, flags rippling in the wind. They descended on the city with hundreds of others, determined to open those convention doors and make the politicians inside listen. But first they hit the Italian media with a shot of reality. Rebels peacefully occupied the entrance halls of the country’s most influential newspapers, TV, and radio stations for a full three hours. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, they held signs that read “The climate has already changed,” and “Help us tell the story.” Some newsrooms showed interest and support for the rebels’ messages. Others buried their heads in the sand, closing their foyers to prevent the public from seeing the actions and ordering security to drag rebels from the buildings. Rebels assemble outside the headquarters of Radiotelevision Italiana (Rai), one of Italy’s biggest broadcasters, to echo the IPCC’s warning of a code red for humanity. Rebels also sowed seeds of hope. Gathering outside the locked gates of the Convention Centre, they planted flowers to attract pollinating insects and threw paper planes through the bars. Calls for a citizens’ assembly were written on their wings. Others sent themselves into the skies, scaling traffic lights to hang a giant banner across a major road outside Milan’s central station, as well as outside the gates of the conference. Firefighters were called to drag the rebel climbers back down to Earth, and police broke their promise not to arrest them if the remaining roadblocks were dismantled. Rebels find themselves surrounded by riot police on the final day of Pre-COP. Security services responded with increasing force to the peaceful protests. On the final day of Pre-COP, a group of rebels blocking traffic were dragged from the street and then penned in by riot police to stop them returning. Other climate activists and even passing Members of the European Parliament stood with the rebels in solidarity. Police also issued thousands of euros’ worth of fines over the five days of rebellion.

Commuters looked on as Red Rebels moved mournfully between the bodies. Even more rebels joined the blockade of one of Zürich’s busiest roads the next morning. Around 300 sat on the tarmac, gave out fliers, and brought the city centre to a standstill. Switzerland's biggest train station hosts a mass extinction event. Photo: Marcus B Rebel organisers had been careful to let police know of their plans, but the reaction was still severe with 134 arrests. It didn’t stop rebels returning to the same spot the next day. This time another 50 rebels were detained overnight. Police became increasingly allergic to rebels as the rebellion progressed. Two people were banned from entering the city for a day just for wearing the XR symbol (following a city-wide ban on the icon). And arrests weren’t just prolific - they were speedy. 15 rebels were arrested within 90 seconds just for walking onto a road holding banners. The wide age range of rebels helped XR appear more respectable to the Swiss press. The sign: ‘Arrested because I’m afraid’ With a seriously depleted pool of rebels, exhausted coordinators decided to wrap up the rebellion one day early. But that’s not to say spirits were low. This rebellion was the first national action XR Switzerland had organised, and the media reaction was unprecedented. Coverage spanned 300 newspapers and was broadly respectful thanks to the many elderly rebels on the streets, as well as the calm reaction to the indiscriminate mass arrests. Overall, this week of rebellion has left XR Switzerland reinvigorated and determined to launch major actions in other Swiss cities soon. With the police instantly arresting rebels on the street, a few protesters retreated to the train station and sang songs instead. 17 SEP | New York, USA At 8 o’clock on the dot, over 100 rebels launched into perfectly coordinated action, surging into the headquarters of three banks infamous for their vast investments in fossil fuels. At JPMorgan Chase, outraged security guards could only watch as rebels glued themselves to entry turnstiles. Several trucks then pulled up and more rebels spilled out, climbing onto awnings and erecting a tripod outside the entrance. Somehow a sailboat anchored down outside the other exit. The bank was blocked. ‘Necessary Trouble’ sails downtown and moors at JPMorgan Chase. Photo: Karla Coté Meanwhile similar things were happening at the Bank of America, with a rebel peppered tripod erected outside and a rock band entertaining passers-by. Further downtown, Citibank’s lawn was occupied by a third group of well drilled rebels armed with a tripod. Confused police arrived on the scene minutes later only to find the three protest sites perfectly set up. JPMorgan notified their staff that they would not be required at work that day. As one rebel described it afterward, it was almost like Hollywood. ‘The Resistance Team’ stage a concert in front of Bank of America. Photo: Mikiodo It took police almost six hours to dismantle the rebel constructions, just in time for a midday march to the UN. Concerned by what the rebels might do next, the police pursued them down the avenue. They found themselves amid an action peaceful enough to be a family event. Rebels percolated through crowds of climate activists, congregated for an ‘Enough Is Enough’ rally, and joined a mass die-in outside the UN headquarters, with half the crowd dressed as water, the other half as fire. 36 rebels were arrested over the day, but the overall reaction was very positive. Many passers-by proclaimed their support for XR, and even some of the police officers quietly commented “I’m with you”. Rebels and other climate activists unite in a mass midday march to the UN. Photo: Mikiodo 24 SEPT | Bogotá, Colombia Colombian rebels took to the streets of their capital in spectacular fashion, painting a magnificent mural and staging a stunning show in the National Park of Bogotá. Along with a coalition of other environmental protesters, rebels assumed the roles of citizens, activists and capitalists (including former president Alvaro Uribe, accused of land theft and overseeing the extrajudicial execution of thousands of civilians). A rebel stands on the freshly painted mural. Sign: This whole system is wrong. Photo: Iván Valencia A performance was then staged, targeting those responsible for the destruction and displacement of indigenous and rural communities in Colombia, and championing collective action in the struggle to overcome entrenched systems of oppression. Musical group, Connybri provided a soundtrack to the day as members of the public joined rebels to discuss the lack of political support for the Escazú Agreement, local fracking by oil companies Ecopetrol and ExxonMobil, and the mining induced deforestation of Colombia. The day of action was a great success and picked up by national media, including the far-reaching El Espectador newspaper. For info on future XR Colombia events check out their Twitter feed.

Refusing a police order to sit down (so his body didn’t stiffen up). The walk is to raise awareness of the Shea Tree which is vital to the indigenous Camino people and being wiped out for charcoal and firewood. 2 OCT | UK An airport for elite private jets was barricaded by rebels locked on to a stretch limousine to highlight the shocking levels of CO2 that private flights emit per passenger. 29 SEP | Madrid, Spain The last 2 rebels taking part in the Earth Fast campaign (seated) end their fast after an amazing 32 days. They were holding out for a meeting with the government and they got one. Their discussion with the Ecological Transition Minister achieved little, but their fast attracted huge media interest and new recruits for XR’s cause. 28 SEP | Boston, USA Rebels and Sunrise Movement activists anchor a boat across the Governor of Massachusetts' driveway. Eight arrests were made.

They demanded root-and-branch reform. 22 SEP | London, UK A coalition of climate activists including rebels blockade the Africa E&P fossil fuel conference. Sponsored by Shell & Exxonmobil, the event even nominated ReconAfrica, whose drilling is endangering a UNESCO World Heritage site, for an award. 15 SEP | London, UK Mermaids die outside the Environment Ministry, part of an Ocean Rebellion action to ban bottom trawling, a disgustingly destructive form of industrial fishing. 10 SEP | Italy, Argentina, Israel, Netherlands Rebels all over the world protested outside (and inside) Brazilian embassies to condemn the government's assault on the Amazon.

I do community work with XR Vaal, such as fighting for community rights, running workshops, and hosting marches and pickets. We are very much involved with promoting food security in the community; for example, by helping our community start their own vegetable garden. For COP we are preparing to march. We will say that we are totally against what is currently happening, as it is going to affect people — especially us. We have a practical example: quarries have been left open and abandoned in our area. They are a threat to our children. Every year some of them fall and drown. Our people don’t have information about mining. Most of the time an owner comes to the community, promising jobs. It’s very hard for us to convince the few who do get a job to be aware of the dangers mining will bring to their communities. So we need to march for awareness. From COP, we expect that people must start taking responsibility for their acts. They must consider the ecosystem and nature first, and ask themselves what is going to happen next. We want our government to consider community before doing anything more. I think if we activists and our communities can push harder, then our government will start listening. Mamosweu took part in Voices of the Climate Crisis, a series of short talks from people at the frontline of climate breakdown. Watch her video and stay tuned for many more.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/10/13/xrcop-xr-georgia-dam/,"In the run-up to COP26 in Glasgow, XR Global is sharing global stories of climate and ecological injustice to underline the need for genuinely equitable and just outcomes from the conference if it is to have any meaningful impact. This piece explores the battle for place and livelihood in Georgia as activists across the country have built a movement to oppose the construction of a dam they say threatens biodiversity, local livelihoods and cultural heritage.March 14 2021 – the International Day of Action for Rivers – a small demonstration in Lechkhumi, Georgia, against the construction of a large dam on the Rioni river, grew into a nationwide environmental protest. The protests on March 14 in Kutaisi Residents of the Rioni River Valley oppose the $800 million hydropower project on the grounds that it will affect eight settlements, with 100 families being subjected to physical resettlement and 197 affected by economic displacement - losing the ability to make a livelihood as a direct result of the proposed site. Three villages will be entirely submerged. Opponents have also warned of threats to biodiversity and the region’s cultural heritage and tourism. Ilia State University’s Institute of Earth Sciences pointed out in 2019 that, in the event of an earthquake, damage to the dam could trigger a 34-metre wave that would hit the city of Kutaisi and could flood 18 municipalities in western Georgia. The seismic and geological risk, the effect on people forced to resettle and lack of transparency from the government around the project are all motivating factors for the protestors who, in October 2020, set up camp outside the offices of ENKA Renewables – the Turkish company contracted to deliver the project – in Zhoneti, and in areas of the Rioni Valley. In April 2021 police were sent into villages, such as Gumati, to erect checkpoints to block off the areas and enable construction to go ahead. Still, the grassroots “guardians of the Rioni Valley” remained committed to their cause, and in March support grew as the activists took their protest to Kutaisi, the country’s third-largest city. Thousands turned out in support of their movement to prevent the dam’s construction. Led by Varlam Goletiani, Maka Suladze, Marita Museliani and others, the protest gained attention, with the opposition parties Lelo and Girchi declaring their support, although Girchi has since changed its stance and now backs the hydropower project. The activists' work has since continued, with a further protest taking place on May 26 - Georgia’s Independence Day - in the capital Tbilisi. The protestors camped in First Republic Square for four days leading up to the demonstration, demanding a complete halt to construction of the dam, the termination of contracts with ENKA, the resignation of the Minister for the Economy Natela Turnava, and the initiation of criminal proceedings against her. The demonstration itself attracted support from a wide range of activists in the city, despite efforts by the media to distort the environmental issues by raising questions about the beliefs of protestors in relation to LGBTQ+ rights. The protestors returned to the Rioni Valley after the demonstration to an enthusiastic welcome in Kutaisi, marked by supportive flag-waving and honking of car horns. Heidi Hautala, a vice-president of the European Parliament, made a statement in support of the protests. The Rioni River Valley Although in April the government of Georgia promised to postpone the construction of the dam in order for more research to take place, the work appears to have continued. Nevertheless, the protestors have managed to draw widespread attention to the environmental and social injustice of the dam project, and to challenge the government’s authority to lease land to foreign investors like ENKA, who are rarely subject to liabilities and can even demand compensation from the government in the case of disruption due to protests. The protestors are also demanding a moratorium on the 80 planned hydropower projects in Georgia until it can be determined whether they are the best solution to the challenges faced by the energy sector; or whether diversification of the sector, in which 70% of energy is generated through hydropower, is needed. Varlam Goletiani has stated that he wants the people to be involved in decision-making around how land is used, to create a country that respects both people and land. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/10/06/xrcop-xr-drc-congo-basin/,"In the run-up to COP26 in Glasgow, XR Global is sharing global stories of climate and ecological injustice to underline the need for genuinely equitable and just outcomes from the conference if it is to have any meaningful impact. This piece explores deforestation and destruction in the Congo Basin through the eyes of local activist and community organizer James, who is working tirelessly to protect and regenerate this vital and magnificent forest. The Amazon rainforest continues to be in the media spotlight for its alarming rates of deforestation. However, less attention has been paid to the world’s second largest rainforest in the Congo Basin, which spans several central African countries and mostly coversing the north of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). With its 10.000 species of tropical plants and high number of endangered animals such as forest elephants, bonobos and mountain gorillas, it is one of the most important wilderness areas left on Earth. The forest is also home to 30 million indigenous people who rely on the forest system for their basic needs such as food and medicine. Compared to the Amazon rainforest, the Congo Basin’s trees are taller and more resilient and store one third more carbon over the same area. Unfortunately, the forest’s ability to store carbon continues to be diminished by climate-change-induced heat rises and drought stifling the forest’s growth. On top of that, the Congo Basin sadly lost a forest area larger than Bangladesh between 2000 and 2014. James, community organizer and founder of several XR groups in the DRC, cites multiple causes of the deforestation: besides industrial scale logging for mines and cultivation, the clearing of the forest is mainly driven by the demand for wood as fuel, as well as expanding agriculture due to population growth. The situation is dire: at the current rate of destruction, all primary rainforest in the Congo Basin will be gone by end of this century. James’ work centers around the plight of the Bambuti people, a tribe of Central African hunter-gatherers driven out of the forest by the degradation of their eco-systems and the sale of their land for development. They are struggling to survive on the fringes of society and often get into conflict with the law, for example by collecting wood for fuel in areas they aren’t allowed to, leading to arrest and abuse. In the eastern part of the DRC, James is part of a group of volunteer ambassadors who get in touch with locals. They collect alerts about local conflicts, disease outbreaks, and environmental issues. Their work also involves assessing the challenges facing the local people which are then communicated to decision-makers. They also strategize with indigenous people on how to survive and make claims for their rights. One of the biggest issues they are facing is the forests and parks being used as hide-outs for armed groups, with frequent cases of kidnapping and sexual assault. Recently, the ambassadors led a street action protesting violence against indigenous women. In another action, masks were distributed in an effort to inform locals about the risk of Covid-19. The activists have high hopes regarding the two upcoming international summits: COP 15 on biodiversity and COP 26 on climate change. They are hoping for impactful intervention from the world’s most powerful countries and the securing of environmental justice for all people in the Global South. Their ideas for the Congo Basin include organizing the indigenous people into large producer communities; regenerating the forest and allowing local people to gain a livelihood from it by growing plants with both ecological and economic benefits such as fruit trees; providing and widening access to less carbon-intensive sources of energy. James stresses that just sending money to the governments of countries such as the DRC won’t be effective. He argues that funds - even those given specifically to invest in environmental projects - might potentially end up in the current president’s election campaign, instead of going to where it is needed most. He suggests that funds should be given directly to local organisations who are close to the people and better understand the urgency and complexities of these local environmental issues. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/09/16/COP26-false-hopes-and-fears/,"After an absence of a year, COP is back; but is there any reason to believe that the latest chapter in this interminable saga can generate meaningful action? What we know for sure is that far too much time has already been wasted and our planet cannot afford yet more failure. Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay The world’s leading climate scientists’ latest report was described as a “code red for humanity”. Its headline message was that climate change is ""widespread, rapid, and intensifying"". They also made it clear that there was no longer any doubt that the primary cause is emissions resulting from human activity. The gravity and urgency of the crisis has been spelt out in starker terms than ever before, but will this finally produce the appropriate response from governments? COP arguably offers the best opportunity to achieve progress within the constraints of our existing economic and political system. In November we’ll see whether the 25th sequel achieves anything, or instead demonstrates that the current system is incapable of delivering action at the scale and pace necessary to avoid ecological breakdown and societal collapse. “Uniting the world to tackle climate change” is the bold claim made on the homepage of the COP26 website. COP26 is the shorthand name for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties. It will take place in Glasgow, Scotland this November, after being delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COP conferences bring together representatives from all around the world with the specific stated aim of tackling climate change. Coming less than 100 days after the publication of the IPCC report, COP26 seems to offer the perfect opportunity for governments to respond, based on a full understanding of the catastrophic threats we face. However, the fact that we still find ourselves in the midst of a rapidly escalating emergency after 25 previous COP conferences suggests that too much optimism would be misplaced. Most people don’t remember very much about COP25, which took place in Madrid in December 2019. The main reason for this is that it achieved very little. The pile of manure dumped outside the conference by Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists summed up the progress made fairly well. Probably the most significant outcome from a COP conference was the 2015 Paris Agreement, which was adopted at COP21. The Paris Agreement’s central goal was to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this goal, countries made commitments to reduce emissions which are known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), requiring participants to make further, more ambitious commitments every five years. Unfortunately, as it stands, most countries have not taken sufficient action to achieve the Paris Agreement’s primary goal. Climate Action Tracker projects that current pledges and targets would result in average global warming of around 2.4°C by 2100. Pledges alone have little value if they’re not backed up with the actions necessary to deliver them: it’s estimated that current policies would result in warming of around 2.9°C. COP26 is the most significant climate meeting since Paris 2015. This is because we’ve reached the end of the first five year cycle, so countries need to increase their NDCs. Countries were originally supposed to do this in 2020, but many have yet to do so. Photo by Mika Baumeister on Unsplash The new IPCC report projects that reaching 1.5°C of warming is pretty much inevitable before 2040. The time lag between emissions and the warming they produce means that COP26 will probably be the last realistic opportunity to reach an agreement that prevents further increases beyond this level. Based on current emission levels, it’s estimated that the amount of carbon in the atmosphere could make warming of 1.5°C inevitable in less than eight years; by the time we complete the next five year cycle, any hopes that remain will be gone. The following factors should (in theory) enhance the chances of success at COP26: The IPCC report published on 9 August underlines the severity and urgency of the situation. Hundreds of scientists contributed to the report, which was then approved by 195 governments. The involvement of so many individuals and scientific bodies is why IPCC reports are generally considered to be pretty conservative: reaching a consensus is tricky and the outcomes tend to represent what everyone was willing to sign up to, meaning they’re generally more cautious than many would wish. If the IPCC is prepared to say the situation is bad, then it really is bad. Despite this inherent conservatism, IPCC reports represent the closest thing we have to a definitive position. The fact that so many scientists and governments have signed up to them lends weight to their findings and makes them difficult to ignore. Such consensus around the severity of the situation should provide increased impetus for progress. 2021 has seen a host of climate related disasters affecting many parts of the world. We’ve witnessed massive wildfires in the U.S., Siberia, Greece and other parts of Europe and severe flooding in China, Germany, Belgium and many other locations. Huge numbers of people have seen the images or been impacted directly. Image by David Mark from Pixabay The consequences of just 1.2°C of warming have shocked many people, including scientists who in some cases had not expected them to be so severe, so rapidly. These events have brought home the fact that the climate crisis is happening right now and isn’t something that will only affect future generations. This heightened awareness and concern is increasing the pressure on governments to act. One of President Biden’s first actions after winning last year’s election was to re-join the Paris Agreement. Alongside China, the U.S. is absolutely pivotal to tackling the climate and ecological emergency (CEE). The total historical emissions of the U.S. are way ahead of every other country (including China) and its emissions per head are also very high. Having the U.S. back at the table is certainly no guarantee of progress, and some of the new administration’s actions are completely at odds with the rhetoric. However, attempting to tackle the CEE without U.S. involvement would be an even bigger challenge. So we’re heading towards COP26 with leading scientists having just set out how bad the situation is. We’ve seen vivid evidence from across the planet of what’s happening already. The actions required to tackle climate change, such as massively reducing both our use of fossil fuels and the methane emissions created by livestock, are well documented. The biggest carbon emitters are back at the table and making the right noises about the need for action. It might seem like all the pieces are falling into place to achieve progress towards a solution. The primary obstacle that remains is a lack of political will to take forward the actions we know are necessary to tackle the CEE. Saying the right things about tackling it is extremely easy, but translating these words into the necessary actions is far more difficult. There’s still massive opposition from those profiting from the status quo, who seek to influence politicians and block progress. Image by Nicola Giordano from Pixabay The latest IPCC report may represent the final nail in the coffin of climate denial, but delay represents just as great a risk to the planet. Too many governments and corporations, aided and abetted by friends in the media, are doing little more than creating the pretence of action. Pledges to achieve net zero by 2050 are being used to distract from how little progress is being made right now. There’s a real danger that people are being lulled into a false sense of security and led to believe that governments have got this covered, which could not be further from the truth. Given the current context, COP26 arguably has the best chance of success it could ever hope for. The rapidly closing window in which warming can be limited to 1.5°C provides an imperative for agreeing immediate action. If COP26 can’t deliver meaningful progress with all these factors in its favour, it’s very difficult to see the COP process ever delivering. November will show us what, if anything, the COP process can achieve, or it may simply provide even more evidence of the need for alternatives. If COP fails yet again, it’s vital that the whole world witnesses this failure, understands the implications for our planet and the requirement for radical change. Governments have already wasted decades and brought us to the point where incremental change can no longer prevent increasingly severe environmental breakdown. We cannot continue with this charade and need far-reaching, urgent action way beyond anything COP has thus far managed to deliver. Extinction Rebellion (XR) believes that upgrading democracy by engaging ordinary people through citizens' assemblies is far more likely to achieve the change our planet so desperately needs. XR aims to overcome the lack of political will by increasing awareness and pressuring governments to take action. We’ll be doing this all around the world in the run up to COP, during the conference and beyond. We’ll continue to demand that governments tell the truth about the severity of the climate and ecological emergency and act now to address it. We’ll also make the case for replacing processes such as COP, that have repeatedly failed us, with more participative democracy. If COP can’t deliver the solutions we need when we need them most, then it is time to recognise that COP is part of the problem. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency. Our movement is made up of people from all walks of life, contributing in different ways with the time and energy they can spare. Chances are, we have a local branch very close to you, and we would love to hear from you. Get involved …or consider making a donation.",Extinction Rebellion

In this issue: Nordic Rebellion | Berlin RiseUp | Impossible Rebellion | Much More Rebellion! Subscribe to this Newsletter. Dear rebel, It’s been a long wait, but a wave of rebellion has once again rippled across the globe. Thousands of rebels coursed through three European capitals to demand action on the climate and ecological crisis. With Covid in remission and social restrictions easing across much of the continent, the streets of Berlin, then Oslo, then London, were again the stage for some much-needed mass disruption. A March of Mourning proceeds through central Oslo as part of the Nordic Rebellion. In Oslo rebels from all over Scandinavia united for one week of Nordic Rebellion, and with elections imminent, managed to get Norway’s oil extraction firmly onto the political agenda. In Berlin thousands of rebels overcame prolific policing to rise up and launch their own politically pointed actions. Some rebels even rose up to the top of the Brandenburg Gate. And finally in London rebels from across the UK launched their Impossible Rebellion, two weeks of roving actions that exposed The City, captured the media, and included a lot of talking around tables. You can find out much more about these spectacular, inventive and expertly choreographed campaigns in Action Highlights.

Check out Upcoming Actions to see how you can help the rebellion wave resurface in Italy, where both the YouthCOP and PreCOP conferences will be held, and in the Netherlands. While the sheer level of rebel activity has made the last few weeks feel special, the truth is that away from our movement, much feels depressingly familiar. Another extreme weather event has struck, with Hurricane Ida devastating large parts of the US and Caribbean. Its high winds and flash floods have left death, toxic chemicals and spilled oil in its wake. A New Yorker is escorted to safety amid flash flooding caused by Hurricane Ida. While our politicians may now be bold enough to blame climate change for this season of chaos, the policies needed to stop the weather getting worse are still nowhere to be seen. In just two short months our leaders will converge for a summit conference in Glasgow, and we shall see what they bring to the COP table. But for now, it is time for our movement to celebrate our raucous return, and for those involved to regenerate. Rebellion may be incredible, and what this world badly needs, but it is also exhausting. As we enter a period of reflection and repair, we must build on what we did right, learn from what we did wrong, and ready ourselves for the great rebellions still to come.

Support our Rebellion 19 - 29 AUG | Oslo, Norway It began aboard a pink sailboat. As the sun rose, the small vessel cruised into the Sture oil terminal on Norway’s west coast, breaching its security zone and stopping all oil tankers in the area. Meanwhile 20 landbased rebels blockaded the terminal’s road entrance. The result: Equinor, the state-owned oil company, couldn’t export crude oil around the world. Scared of bad publicity, the oil giant chose to ignore the blockade and ship in employees from a distant harbour. Exports were blocked for an amazing 27 hours. 5 salty seadogs approach Sture oil terminal. Banner: ‘Equinor - heading for catastrophe’ This was just the prelude to the Nordic Rebellion, the biggest civil disobedience campaign for the climate in Norwegian history. Norway is the world's 7th largest exporter of CO2 emissions, and its government plans to extract North Sea oil until at least 2070. Hundreds of rebels from across Scandinavia (and a few more from outside it) converged on the capital, determined to change the nation’s course. Nordic Rebellion Highlights: A bridge occupation in central Oslo (which became one of 3 campsites for guest rebels), a March of Mourning, a kayak blockade of Oslo Harbour. XR Norway Youth occupied the lobby of the Ministry of Oil and Energy, demanding their government cease oil exploration immediately and stop oil production by 2025. The oil minister came down for a constructive chat, then told the media outside that the young rebels were trying to sidetrack democracy. After 6 hours the police started arresting people. The youngest to be handcuffed and fined was just 17. The city later hosted a March of Mourning, led by a priest with a giant black veil inscribed with 100 critically endangered species. The solemn rebel column marched across the city centre into Parliament Square, stopping outside three ecocidal ministries. As the marchers passed the Ministry of Agriculture, rebels stormed inside and glued themselves to the windows. As the March passes the Transport Ministry, a rebel artist pours makeshift asphalt over herself and her painting of an area that will be destroyed for a new highway. Rebels also gave Equinor another dose of disruption, hanging a huge banner from atop its towering headquarters. It read “Fracking Kills: Out of Vaca Muerta Now!” in reference to Equinor’s fracking of a vast shale oil deposit in Argentina. The protest was attended by indigenous activists and the Argentinian scientist and EcoLeaks founder Esteban Servat. Norway is seen as a bastion of free speech and democracy, but the state has become increasingly draconian in its dealings with rebels. While never violent, the police threatened to kick out rebels who were not Norwegian citizens, and issued hefty fines. 129 activists were arrested over the rebellion, some multiple times, and fines amounted to a staggering 2.1 million Kroner (over $242,000). Rebels occupy a crossroads between Norway’s parliament and royal castle. Police quickly cleared it, but the plucky rebels retook it the next day, and the day after that! The banner: ‘We believe in a life after oil - Break the Oil Habit’. Norway is in the middle of a general election campaign, and many media outlets have credited the Nordic Rebellion for putting the nation’s oil extraction on the political agenda. The 3 major parties (who all back oil exploration and extraction well past 2050) are losing popularity while momentum is building for the smaller climate-conscious parties. Rebels believe they’ve moved Norway’s climate agenda forward, but doubts remain if it will be enough to cause a political upset. 16 - 20 AUG | Berlin, Germany Elections in Germany are fast approaching, but in the face of rising temperatures and mass extinction, no political party has a satisfactory climate plan. In response, Berlin rebels launched the August RiseUp, a week of actions demanding immediate political change. But as they hit the streets, they found them filled with police. Rebels sang in front of the Brandenburg Gate and erected tripods in a nearby park, but bigger plans (and the equipment to launch them) were hindered by the extraordinary police presence. Even police union chiefs criticised the numbers involved, citing fears of ‘unattractive images before the elections’ as the motive. Protests instantly draw a massive police presence. Credit: Gerald Matzka. Despite the flood of fuzz, the rebellion thrived, and complacent politicians felt the heat. An action at the Social-Democrat party (SPD) headquarters was impeded, but the Christian Democrats (CDU, the current party in power) building was sprayed with fake blood as rebels glued themselves to the glass. Rebels also occupied the building of the CDU’s economic council, chalking down helpful suggestions like “change your diet, not the climate”. They later blockaded the state building of North Rhine Westphalia - Germany’s mining and industrial heartland. Rebels operated small excavators next to a pile of coal while wearing masks of fossil fuel friendly politicians. Red Rebels present the German parliament with the key to reducing emissions. Inscribed: transport change, agricultural change, energy change, construction change, consumption change, industrial change, constitutional amendment. The ravishing Red Rebels were spotted parading in front of the Food and Agriculture Ministry, and when their oversized black coffin was confiscated by the police and driven away, the symbolism matched any that was planned by rebels. Ghost nets (old fishing nets pulled from the sea) were spread out over one of the city’s main squares for an ocean-themed action, and a Volkswagen car showroom was blocked by 150 rebels to protest the automobile lobby. Despite occasional acts of unprovoked police violence, most rebel actions proceeded peacefully. Rebels rise up to the top of the Brandenburg Gate. Credit: Stefan Müller. The RiseUp ended as it began - with another massive blockade under the Brandenburg Gate. Swarms of rebels halted traffic, two rebel trucks drove onto the intersection to block it for good, and tripods and beehives (hexagonal protest structures) were speedily erected. 6 brave rebels scaled the great Gate itself, while others chained themselves to the trucks and tripods. Despite a rapid response by police, spirits were high as rebels staged a final and spontaneous die-in. 23 AUG - 4 SEP | London, UK Stop all fossil fuel investment NOW! That was the demand, made to the government, by XR UK’s fifth major Rebellion, which saw thousands or rebels take part in two weeks of daily protests (no site holds this time). Backed by the International Energy Agency, the demand was a test of the government’s commitment to climate action ahead of hosting COP26. So far there has been no formal response to the demand, but a total of 508 rebels were arrested for making it. With the British Establishment claiming immediate action on the climate crisis is impossible, the first week of this Impossible Rebellion focused on crisis talks. And for talks you need tables. The humble table became the symbol of this Rebellion, and citizens across the UK were invited to ‘pull up a chair’ by 200 specially trained table hosts. The world’s largest pink Crisis Talks table lived for 24hrs. RIP. Credit: Andrea Domeniconi The second week of action was focused on The City, the square mile of London where the offices of major global financial institutions are located: banks, hedge funds, stock exchanges, and the Bank of England. The City invests so much money in fossil fuels, if it were a country it would be the 9th biggest emitter in the world - that’s more than the entire output of Germany! And not only is The City a major engine of the climate crisis, it was also built on blood money from the slave trade, and continues to profit from colonialisation and exploitation today. IN CASE OF CLIMATE EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS: XR women await arrest after breaking windows at JP Morgan (the ‘World’s Worst Bank’) Credit: Gareth Morris. UK rebels feel the Impossible Rebellion has marked a return to the vibrant, Samba-band powered energy of pre-Covid actions. While the movement feels slightly leaner than before, with less arrests than previous rebellions, there is also a sense that it is stronger, and that a majority of the public now ‘get’ where XR is coming from. Outreach rebels reported how the tables had turned as concerned citizens approached them to express their fears about the future. In the run up to Rebellion a record-breaking £100k ($140k) was raised in just 24hrs. For more and more people, disruption works. Media interest has been constant, and notably more supportive, with primetime news presenters giving respectful interviews, refuting tired old attacks, and even issuing mea culpas over previously 'wrong' and 'lazy' positions! Animal Rebellion held crisis talks over McDonald’s tables in central London, part of their campaign to make the restaurant chain plant-based by 2025. The Impossible Rebellion also cemented how XR UK now prioritises global justice. The Opening Ceremony coincided with the 230th anniversary of the Haitian Revolution, the only successful rebellion by enslaved black people in modern history. Moving speeches made clear that UK rebels should not see themselves as ‘saving the world’, but rather following in the footsteps of Global South activists who’ve been rebelling against the same forces for centuries. Both rebels and the police brought new tactics to London’s streets. Large marches became distractions for smaller, more disruptive rebel actions nearby, while police quickly surrounded and cleared protest sites to stop them spreading. Police beat and drag rebels from a protest bus on London Bridge Credit: Gareth Morris. Rather than holding sites for as long as possible, rebels stayed mobile and unpredictable, launching pop-up actions via a broad family of sister movements that included Animal Rebellion, XR Youth, XR ISN and Money Rebellion. Over-policing was rife, and rushed officers occasionally used shocking violence to stop new protest sites from blossoming. Rebels were beaten with batons and nearly crushed by toppled protest structures but always remained calm and committed to non-violence.

A surrealist Rebellion of One points out that, in the month Indonesia celebrates independence, the country is not free from the Climate Crisis. 16 AUG | Moratumulla, Sri Lanka. Rebels both human and animal took part in a beach clean-up, though numbers were limited by the pandemic.12kg of nurdles (pellets used by the plastics industry) were collected. 21 AUG & 3 SEP | Vancouver, Canada. Rebels marched through downtown Vancouver and brought along a carnival band. There was dancing, street art, and thanks to all the police, arrests. It didn’t stop rebels returning to the same streets two weeks later. 25 AUG | Rotterdam, Netherlands. Thirty Dutch rebels shut down Shell for the day! Using banners and bamboo structures they blockaded Shell Pernis, Europe’s largest oil refinery. Watch a short video of the day and sign up for the incoming Dutch rebellion. 25 AUG | Buenos Aires, Argentina. Rebels protest outside the Chinese Embassy. A political deal will see industrial pig farms opened in the country to export pork to China. 25 AUG | Herzliya, Israel. Rebels use fire extinguishers to spray-paint the Israeli headquarters of the American oil company Chevron. 28 AUG | Worldwide (pictured France, Tunisia, Bangladesh). Over 100 rebels based in countries all around the world are taking part in an XR Earth Fast. Some went without food for a day, others a week. A brave few are still going until their demands are met. 3 SEP | Brasília, Brazil. Over 1,000 indigenous protestors celebrate a surprise decision by the Prosecutor General to affirm their rights to historic lands. Whatever the courts decide, the far-right government is still set on seizing their lands and handing it over to agribusiness, mining and logging interests. The unprecedented protests will continue. From 29 SEP | Milan, Italy Milan will soon be hosting both the YouthCOP and PreCOP. These preparatory meetings will affect the negotiations and decisions made during COP26. XR Italy believes this is humanity's last chance to avert climate chaos, and that it’s time for the ostriches to get their heads out of the sand. We invite rebels from all over the world to join us during these conferences for a week of rebellion in Milan. Actions will start from 29 September.

This exceptional work of fiction from the Polish Nobel laureate is difficult to categorise and even harder to put down. It tells the story of Janina, a reclusive and eccentric old woman living in a remote Polish village. She is beset by ailments, fascinated by astrology, and dismayed by a world where animals are mistreated with impunity. When a series of men from a local hunting club are found dead, and the police seem unable to solve the mystery, Janina finds evidence that points to the incredible - the local animals are finally seeking their revenge on humanity. Part crime thriller, part environmental diatribe, part darkly humorous character study, this wild and unconventional novel is an absolute joy. Its plotting will grab you, its insights will move you, and its masterful use of language will leave you spellbound. Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops by buying your books at Bookshop or Hive. I am from Ogoni, the Niger Delta part of Nigeria, and presently based in London. I became involved with Extinction Rebellion because they are demanding global climate justice. If a person is passionate about justice, but sees it manacled, before they realise it he or she is an activist. Shell were once a darling company to the Ogoni people. As a boy, I saw their arrival on Ogoni land in 1958. Their workers enjoyed the welcome from the indigenous people who were excited to do business. Attitudes changed against Shell only when the people realised their darling company was responsible for their predicaments. The unlucky thing for the Ogoni people was that realisation came too late. Shell operated 96 oil wells which were connected to 6 oilfields. Soot from the wells billowed into the atmosphere - 24/7 for 35 years. We used to drink rainwater and stream water. Now that is no longer possible. Such situations motivated me to join the Ogoni struggle for justice when it started in 1990. When times are tough, never give up. Justice always sails through, despite temporary setbacks. The future is bright for Extinction Rebellion. More and more people are joining their activities. The truth has to be told, and the only person to be offended by the truth is the wrongdoer. I was asked, by people who were aware of my first-hand knowledge and involvement in global campaigns, to write a book on the Ogoni people and their struggle for justice. ‘OGONI: The Struggle for Justice’ by Simeon B.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/08/20/global-newsletter-54/,"A pram burns in front of Australia’s Parliament House after their Environment Minister appeals Duty of Care to protect young people from the climate crisis. In this issue: A Brief History of COP | Good COP, Bad COP? | XR Australia Dear rebel, This summer has seen a terrifying escalation of extreme weather. Every day seems to bring another record-breaking heatwave, another devastating flood, another uncontainable wildfire. Last week the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published their latest report. Eight years in the making, involving hundreds of experts, and signed off by nearly 200 governments, it represents the global consensus on the science of climate change. Its basic conclusion: things will inevitably get worse. Drastic action is urgently required to ensure things don’t get catastrophically worse. And this is all definitely our fault. Humanity is guilty. A Greek woman loses her home to wildfire on the Island of Evia Photo: Bloomberg Of course, we are not all equally to blame. While those who have done the least to cause this chaos starve to death among arid fields, those who have done the most compete with one another to leave the planet altogether. The same governments that agreed on the IPCC report’s findings will soon meet at the UN’s climate conference, COP26, to negotiate a policy response. COP26 is being billed by those world leaders attending it, and much of the world’s media, as the place for a climate crisis turning point, the moment when words must become action, and this spiralling emergency is finally brought under control. But what is COP26? How does it work? And if this is where we are after 25 of them, why would the 26th be any different? Rebels march through Madrid during COP25 in 2019. In this issue we take a sober look at COP26. For a brief history of these ongoing ‘Conference of Parties’, and the problems that must be overcome in November, head to Action Highlights. There you will also find a range of expectations for the summit from informed rebels across the world. For a basic guide to COP26, as well as deep dives into what must be achieved there and how the negotiations actually work, head to Must Reads. Finally, this issue has a fascinating piece on rebel protests in Australia, triggered by their environment minister’s appeal against a landmark court ruling stating that she has a ‘duty of care’ to protect young people from the climate crisis. In the face of such random devastation, such billionaire folly, such down-to-the-wire political complacency and cowardice, it is easy to let our anxiety turn to despair and despondency. But we must not let it. We must turn it into rage, into loving rage, into rebellion. We must meet with our fellow rebels on the streets, join the international wave of rebellions about to begin, and show our political leaders that this ‘new normal’ is not acceptable.

Support the Rebellion 1-12 NOV | Glasgow, Scotland What do the delegates at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) need to agree on for it to be considered a success? What, if anything, have previous COPs achieved? Should we be hopeful that this year will lead to a breakthrough? Delayed for a year by the pandemic, COP26 is cited as critical, ranking in significance alongside 1997’s COP3, when the Kyoto protocol was established; and the 2015 COP21, which led to the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rise below 2°C, and preferably at 1.5°C. Conclusion of COP21 with the Paris Agreement. Despite the ‘breakthroughs’ at COP3 and COP21, a UN report last year confirmed that even if current emission reduction pledges under the Paris Agreement were fulfilled, the world would still be headed for a catastrophic 3.2°C increase this century. The levels of ambition in the Paris Agreement must be tripled to achieve 2°C, and increased more than fivefold for 1.5°C. COP26 must also agree on a response to extreme weather events, particularly in the global south, where millions are already suffering from severe climate change. Organisations such as Climate Action Network are urging developed countries, which are largely responsible for the climate crisis, to include the impact of their historic greenhouse gas emissions in setting new targets; this is referred to as ‘fair share accounting’. But wealthier nations are yet to even deliver on the promise made at COP15 in 2009, to provide at least $100bn per year by 2020 to assist developing countries adapt to climate change. Photo: Climate Action Network. Finally, COP26 needs to either make its agreements binding (existing Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs come under a nonbinding section of the Paris Agreement!), or set up systems to enforce and monitor these commitments for years to come. The last COP in Madrid completely failed to resolve these issues, despite running two days over schedule. There was little progress on NDCs, with industrialising economies such as China and India arguing that rich countries must lead, all while adopting more modest targets, themselves. There was also a focus on carbon markets at COP25, seen by many as a scam to enable rich countries to continue burning fossil fuels while paying poor countries to deal with the negative impacts. Greta Thunberg speaking out at COP25 in Madrid. Is there reason to believe things will transpire differently this year? Not really. The G7 summit in June, for instance, failed to make any meaningful progress on climate finance; they couldn’t even agree on a timetable for the phase-out of coal. The Climate Ambition Summit last December showed how far off track we are on Paris Agreement goals: over 60% of countries have yet to submit new NDCs, and the 74 countries that have submitted them represent just 13% of global CO2 emissions. Will our appointed leaders fail us again, even at this eleventh hour? Probably. Can the continued escalation of worldwide nonviolent protests get us to a solution that the science requires? We think so! AUG | Everywhere As we near the next big international UN climate summit, we asked rebels around the world - from Indonesia to New York City, Uganda to the UK - to tell us how they felt about COP26. Hopeful? Fearful? Angry? This is what they said. Melissa, XR Indonesia Personally, I am not hoping for much from COP26 itself, as most negotiations are done with the basic interest of protecting existing economies’ structures. Anything we do with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as an anchor, will not result in the climate justice that we deserve. However, I am hopeful that COP26 will serve as an additional spark of momentum for a greater thirst for change to come in our respective countries, as leaders will no longer be able to hide their fake solutions and bullsh*t commitments, which should propel a proper system change everywhere. Moussa, XR Senegal Land of drought, deforestation, famine, flooding, precariousness: Africa contributes just up to 4% of greenhouse gases. COP26, we want the truth. Cathy, XR COP26 I fear that power politics will dominate COP26, and the rich world will fail to act to repair the global catastrophe their emissions have created. It would be transformative for the whole of humanity if immediate, just, and enforceable decisions are made keeping temperatures below 1.5 degrees heating, and if these solutions are rooted in Nature. XR Rebel, Africa As only government affiliates get to be involved in decision-making during the summit, collaborating in greenwashing with COP26 organisers, any results are ruined. COP26 will misrepresent deadly climate change, as well as the ecological and social crisis situation on the ground. We are not hopeful! Clare, XR UK COP is set up to fail humanity again. International negotiations never had the mandate to change the rules that drive the crisis, nor a mandate to address the economic model that drives the crisis. It's always been a decade behind the green movement; a theatre of concern rather than a platform for global change. This is why we rebel. Dag, XR Norway The COP negotiations have failed us for more than thirty years. Norway, for example, is a vocal proponent of international climate negotiations and proudly boasted that it was one of the first nations to sign the Paris Agreement in 2015. Yet it continues to heavily subsidise oil exploration. This kind of hypocritical theatre sabotages the COP negotiations. Emma, XR Youth Uganda The world cannot turn a blind eye any longer when climate crisis issues here are so critical. They do not give us enough media because we are in Africa. We will be the media ourselves, then. Eric, XR NYC I wish politicians would stop talking and start doing something to actually reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the air. So much of what they say are merely goals for 2030 or 2050, rather than actual reductions in today's levels. But the record heat in British Columbia and Sicily is happening in 2021 - this summer, not decades from now - as are record floods in China and Germany, and all the wildfires around the world. Act now, before it's too late. Rebel, XR Rwanda It would be better if we realised we are all indebted to the planet in some way. The test is whether we are still willing to identify responsibly and honestly with that debt and act urgently. Orthalia, XR South Africa Africa’s situation deserves extraordinary attention at COP26. African countries need a platform to address their needs: the continent contributes the least emissions but suffers the brunt of the consequences. Developed countries need to stop shifting their climate responsibilities, particularly regarding the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions. 6 & 10 AUG | Canberra, Australia On 8 July, the Australian Minister for the Environment was found in federal court to have a legal 'duty of care' to protect young people from the climate crisis. She immediately appealed. We are appalled. Rebels responded with an escalating series of disruptive ‘duty of care’ protests. Following some artistically bloody mayhem at the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, resulting in five arrests, rebels returned two days later covered in fake blood, splashing red paint over the floor, and supergluing themselves to the reception desk. Eight more arrests were made. Environment minister Sussan Ley is reminded of her ‘duty of care’ at her workplace. Even more dramatically apt was the action at Parliament House a few days later, where rebels glued themselves to the courtyard, spray painted the outside walls with ‘Duty of Care’ and set fire to a baby pram. They also spray painted the fence of the prime minister’s residence. This action finally got both the media attention and publicity the rebels had been seeking, as news outlets scrambled to cover the drama and XR recruitment numbers surged. Again, eight people were arrested, this time with seven remaining in prison on remand. Rebels send a clear message to Australia’s Minister for the Environment. In a predictable response from a leader who in a recent press conference effectively blamed climate change on the developing world, prime minister Scott Morrison decried the actions as “selfish protests” and “foolishness”. He neglected to acknowledge the fact that by appealing against the federal ‘duty of care’ ruling, the government is selfishly fighting for its right to continue damning future generations. A painted plinth exposes the government’s criminal negligence. More heartening was the response of the judges, who have repeatedly articulated that they respect the rebels’ actions and care about the endangered future of their own grandchildren. Running into some arrestees in the supermarket, one judge even said “I’m glad I bumped into you because it gave me some atonement.” Connect with XR Australia and follow their progress here. 6 AUG | New York, USA: Topless rebels blockaded and glued themselves to the lobby of NBC studios, demanding the network news corporation tell the naked truth about the Climate Crisis.

Welcome to Must Reads, rebel. What is COP26? How can I join the protests there? What needs to happen for the COP21 Paris Agreement to be finalised? Why did COP25 go so wrong, and what are the alternatives to COPs, anyway? Answers are below, rebel! Answers! XR Scotland: COP26 Info Hub Featuring a quick guide to the conference, practical info for rebels wanting to come down for the protests, and a five-point agreement that should be followed by those who do. Climate Action Network: COP26 - Delivering The Paris Agreement A report by developing countries outlining what is expected of developed countries to ensure real progress in Glasgow. Within these pages are traces of the historic arrogance and broken promises of the rich nations that have made previous COPs so inert. Youtube: Boiling Point | COP26 Webinars (6 x 1hr) This series of six webinars created by the COP26 Coalition gives you a potted history of each conference, the big issues still to solve, what to expect from COP26, and the inside story on what the negotiation process is actually like. The Strait Times: 5 Reasons COP25 Failed Reasons include poor host facilitation, the presence of hundreds of oil lobbyists, Chinese stubbornness in the face of Western broken promises, a global rise in nationalism, and Donald Trump. One of those can be struck off the list for COP26. What about the rest? Intelligencer: UN Climate Talks Collapsed In Madrid - What’s The Way Forward? Fresh from the failure of COP25, journalist David Wallace-Wells asks whether we can ever expect world governments (and oil lobbyists) to broker a deal on the climate crisis, and what the alternative mechanisms might be. This beautiful book has been crafted with a clear goal: explain the climate crisis in a way that engages young children, allows them to understand its causes and effects, and empowers them to take preventative action. Each page is lavished with lovely illustrations, clear explanations of complex subjects, and illuminating facts. It is not just younger readers who will enjoy poring over these pages! Peppered throughout the book are mini-bios of changemakers: young climate activists from around the world who have done amazing work to heal our planet. Importantly, care has been taken to always give young readers ways that they can actively address the many problems that a book such as this one raises. And though hope courses through it, Stevens doesn’t flinch from portraying just how devastating some of the effects of this crisis will be, particularly on biodiversity. That said, while the author does an excellent job of delving into all sorts of controversial solutions - from dietary changes to reducing consumerism - the book restricts its solutions to the individual level. Systemic changes are not addressed. Given the age of the audience such an approach is understandable, but the lack of any mention of citizen assemblies - and why they might be preferable to our current politics - feels like a missed opportunity. Still, there is a whole section about becoming an activist, making placards, and getting one’s school to declare a climate emergency. It may wear it lightly, but this is still a radical children’s book, and one every child would gladly spend time with. Looking for more rebel reading material?

I was an architect for 45 years, and for the last 15 of those I was a full-time sustainability professional working in the built environment. Among other things, I was invited to speak at the United Nations Renewable Energy Congress, and helped develop the supposed “Sustainable Economic Recovery Plan for Europe” for 2010 to 2020. I set aside that work a little over two years ago to care for my wife, who has a progressive neurological condition. I have now also turned my attention to environmental activism. I joined XR shortly after turning down an invite from the Chinese government to speak at their Sustainable Coastal Cities Development Programme Congress. I decided I didn't need to go halfway around the world to have my message ignored! I’m a member of XR Glasgow, where we're preparing for COP26. We’ve spoken about various steps that will be taken throughout the programme, with a focus on our response to an unsatisfactory outcome, including a potential blockade - be it symbolic or actual. My expectations for COP26 are very low. On the one hand, I don’t think the government or businesses are willing to act with the urgency we need. And on the other hand, I don’t think any of us fully understands just how far along we are on the trajectory toward collapse. We need to square up to what is at stake here - for humanity, but also for us individually - and decide whether we’d be prepared to face that.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/07/26/fast-fashion/,"Over the last thirty years, our relationship with our clothes has drastically changed. Our shopping habits are transformed and our wardrobes expanded. Where once we shopped with the seasons, it’s now normal to bag a weekly bargain with just the spare change in your pocket. Yet while our bursting wardrobes may make us feel more 'complete' for a little while, it’s the environment which is bearing the devastating cost. The personal wardrobe has become intensely political, and it’s time we all got informed. Source: Unsplash The Google searches which return the most hits for fast fashion all describe it in the context of three key qualities: i) Speed of production ii) Low prices and iii) Immense profits for the consumer-facing companies involved. The Wikipedia entry, for example, goes as follows: Fast fashion is a term used to describe a highly profitable business model based on replicating catwalk trends and high-fashion designs, and mass-producing them at low cost. Wikipedia, January 2021 True. Fast fashion is indeed the rapid production of apparel which copies runway fashion trends. Garments are made for retailers at the lowest possible cost and then sold in vast quantities online and in high streets across the world. So far, so informative. However, whilst these definitions are correct, they are also incomplete. All lack a fourth element, specifically, the element of exploitation. Retailers try hard to hide it, and many of us try equally as hard to ignore it. But when clothes are produced quickly and cheaply, they are also produced exploitatively. ""Why?"" ""How?"" And ""Can I still love clothes and skip the exploitation?"" I hear you say. Well, for all you denim devotees, flare fanatics and lycra lovers, this is the blog for you. The site of The Rana Plaza Building, 2013. Source: nyusternbhr, Flickr Broadly speaking, we can use two big economic leaps to explain fast fashion’s path to power - The Industrial Revolution, and the later global push to neoliberalism. In the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution saw textile machinery displace garment production from the household into textile mills and factories. In the UK, large numbers of poor women, men and children became the labour force behind a growing ‘ready-made clothes’ industry. By ‘sweating’ labour, factory owners paid them incredibly low wages, enforced mandatory overtime and maintained abysmal working conditions. All the while, the raw materials needed for this transformation in the productive process were 'outsourced' to the colonies, where slavery ensured cheap, unceasing labour. Jumping forward two hundred years and we find ourselves in the midst of the increasingly globalised, neoliberal nineties. This brought on a rapidly changing system of worldwide clothes production. Acting on rising customer demands and new free trade agreements, western brands began to shift production overseas. They hired manufacturers, who in turn hired contractors, who hired subcontractors, who hired garment workers in the Global South. Large production bases for western brands were formed in countries with cheap labour and few regulations, and this lengthy 'commodity chain' means less transparency so big name brands can get away with murder, sometimes literally. As this outsourcing continues today, our clothes workers are locked into a miserable race to the bottom. Factories throughout SouthEast Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia still compete to win subcontracts from western retailers. The vast majority (approximately 80%) of world’s garment workers are women, and gender discrimination is rife. Hourly-paid supervisor roles are often occupied by men, whilst women are paid piece-by-piece, often subjected to verbal and physical abuse, and deprived of social security benefits. Child labour is not uncommon, nor are life threatening conditions or 20-hour days. Factory owners push wages ever lower, enforce overtime, and maintain conditions that are at best unsanitary, at worst, deadly. Some would call this efficiency improvement. Better to call it sweating 2.0. This time, gone global. Source: Unsplash Fast Fashion is, quite literally, addictive. Studies have shown that when we bag a new bargain, dopamine reward pathways in the brain are activated. Dopamine is a feel-good neurotransmitter associated with addictions to smoking, drugs and caffeine. As clothes have become cheaper and more available, so has the opportunity to gain that addictive dopamine dose. Misguided, for example, proudly states on its website that it releases around 1000 new styles a week - misguided indeed. To shift such vast quantities of stock, brands play psychological games. They make emotive, celebrity-backed advertising campaigns. They create a false sense of urgency through sales and change store layouts frequently, placing cheap items next to similar more expensive ones to create a false perception of value. They collaborate with ‘buy now, pay later’ apps to encourage impulsive spending, and so on. It’s behavioural psychology 101. The result: compulsive consumerism and fast fashion addiction. Whilst brands make us want to spend more, their poor quality garments reinforce our practical need to. These days, clothes are designed to be disposed of, and quickly. Statistics show that the average American shopper now owns at least five times more clothing now than in 1980. For every five fast fashion garments produced, the equivalent of three end up on landfill sites or incinerated in under a year. To use the words of economist Tim Jackson, we find ourselves deep within a system in which: People are persuaded to spend money we don't have, on things we don't need, to create impressions that won't last, on people we don't care about. It’s a great quote, to which I have to make just one small adjustment. There is one place on which our spending is leaving a lasting impression, and it’s that one we all depend on - our home, planet Earth. Source: Pexels From cotton crop into crop top, each step a garment takes from the farm to the fiesta has immense environmental implications. When displayed in carefully curated shop floors, it can be hard to imagine the farming, factories and ferrying behind our clothes. Yet the impacts of these processes are vast and wide reaching. From fossil fuel use, river pollution, depletion of fresh water systems, immense waste production, ocean plastics, the damage is ever increasing. Source: Pexels It is now hotter on our home planet than it has been for at least 12,000 years. This is, in no small part, thanks to the global fashion industry. Soft fabrics in pretty pastel colours don’t immediately scream out oil and coal, but they are the base upon which most of our clothes are built. Increasingly popular synthetic fibres are produced using both coal and petroleum. Whilst they use less water than their natural counterparts, the energy required and CO2 emitted is higher. Synthetic fibres also pollute. As an oil-based plastic, polyester does not biodegrade like natural fibres. It can stay in landfill waste for hundreds of years. When washed, synthetic fibres shed and eventually end up in waterways and oceans as microplastic fibres. As high-speed, low-cost fashion has come to dominate, so has the use of cheaper synthetic fibre such as polyester. If you check your t-shirt now, there’s a high chance you’re sporting at least some of the synth - it’s now estimated to make up 60% of garments globally. As garments are being produced, they can travel many times around the world before they even make it to the shelf. Estimates show that fashion’s carbon impact industry has an impact carbon greater than Aviation and Maritime Shipping combined. Every new tonne of this carbon released pushes the global temperature average rise closer to the 1.5°C limit - a pathway at which we are already seeing irreparable damage. From giant whales down to tiny bacteria, Earth’s species diversity gives and sustains life on our planet. Yet we are losing at an alarming rate. Pesticide-intensive fashion agriculture plays a major part in this demise. As the demand for clothes has increased, so too has the demand for high turnover and fast-growing crops. This has led to a marked shift towards pesticide-intensive, biodiversity-destroying agriculture. To produce the high turnover of cotton now demanded by the fast fashion supply chain, farmers use toxic chemicals in excess. These all but eliminate natural organisms such as fungi, insects or weeds. They contaminate the surrounding soil and water. They destroy insect populations, reduce soil fertility, toxify aquatic systems and leave them all but devoid of life. Environmental activist and scholar Vandana Shiva labels pesticides as ‘ecological narcotics’ as the more a crop receives them, the more it depends on them. In China, the joke goes that you can tell the “it” colour of the season by looking at the colour of the rivers - a joke that, by now, has surely lost it’s humour. For years, waterways which once served as the lifeblood of communities throughout Asia have suffered an unrelenting discharge of untreated wastewater from the dyes, heavy metals and other toxicants of surrounding clothes factories. Left with no other option, communities continue to use this water for drinking and bathing. Diseases such as cancer, gastric and skin diseases are endemic, but continue to go largely unacknowledged by polluting brands. And it’s not just water abuse, but also water use, that affects vulnerable communities. Fast fashion is incredibly thirsty. To make just one basic cotton T-shirt, estimates show that it takes roughly 2,700 litres of water. That’s more than the equivalent of 25 bathtubs of water for every cotton T-shirt you own. To take a more immediately obvious example, the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan was once the world’s fourth largest lake, surrounded by fishing communities and lush forests and wetlands. To sustain the garment export industry, throughout the late 20th century, the Government started to divert its fresh water to irrigate cotton crops and sustain the growing cotton industry. Fishermen lost livelihoods. Pollution from salt and dust from the lake bed caused widespread health problems. In 2014, NASA released shocking images showing that the Sea was all but completely dried up. Whilst with careful restoration action the water is slowly returning, local communities are still suffering the impacts. Unemployment is high while thousands suffer respiratory diseases and long-term health impacts. The Aral Sea, Uzbekistan, almost completely dried due to cotton irrigation. Source NASA Earth Observatory Mountains of Landfill Waste. Source: Pexels Our fashion system causes tonnes and tonnes of fabric to be discarded, burnt or dumped in landfills. As much as 73% of material going into the clothing system ends its life in landfill or incinerated. Design bases tend to sit in Western countries within the EU or US, whilst production bases are in the global south. This means that mistakes, misunderstanding and misprints are commonplace. Often entire batches are thrown away before clothes even make it out of the factory. After the point of sale, things aren’t much better. Poor quality garments mean clothes have to be replaced quickly, and more often than not carelessly. Approximately 85% of the clothing Americans consume is sent to landfills after use, rather than resold or recycled. Often brands actively encourage this disposal cycle, in order to shift more stock. In 2017 and 2018, brands such as H&M, Burberry and Nike were exposed to burning mountains of unsold items in a bid to prevent the devaluation of their current stock. In H&M’s case, this was claimed to be as much as 19 tonnes of obsolete clothing, or the equivalent of around 50,000 pairs of jeans. In a system where mountains of unworn clothes are burnt and slashed, whilst the process that produced them destroys lives, it’s clear something is drastically wrong. Source: Unsplash It is often said that if we would just stop buying so many clothes, everything would change. Whilst this has an element of truth, it also serves to remove the blame from the multinational brands that have so much power. Yes, we can make important changes as individuals, but we did not create the problem. Yes, our shopping habits must change, but our power as consumers extends far beyond just that. Individual changes aren’t always easy, but it’s important to remember that no-one is a perfect ‘environmentalist’. Doing what you can and pushing your personal boundaries to live your values and create the change you want to see is key. Fast fashion is a big beast to slay, but as consumers and citizens we have many lines of attack. If you feel inspired to act, here are just a few suggestions to start you off: Demand transparency – If you can’t imagine a life without shopping; get informed and mobilise. Take part in Fashion Revolution’s #whomademyclothes campaign and fight against the system that locks so many workers into barely-paid, exploitative and dangerous work. Read the yearly Transparency Index, support the most sustainable brands and hold the others to account. The Fashion Checker is a great source which allows you to check any brand, for living wage, transparency and public commitments made. Take the 30-wear pledge - When buying an item thing ‘Do I really need this item? Will I wear it 30 times? Is it of high quality and will it last?’ Check the quality of clothes before you buy them. Click here for a detailed guide on how to. Shop second hand - Many cities are now populated with trendy vintage and traditional charity shops, whilst platforms like Depop offer access to a wide variety of used and vintage garments. UK-based Depop alternative Esooko offers second hand vintage clothes with proceeds going to environmental activist causes. Repair, Rewear, Recycle, Rent – Organise clothes swaps. Don’t throw away clothes, find a seamstress in your area, or see if you can have a go yourself. Donate old clothes to charity. Rent the clothes you need for big occasions - Rent the Runway is perhaps the most well-known. By Rotation is another UK based peer-to-peer platform facilitating the sharing of people's personal wardrobes, for more casual, day to day wear. And finally, and most importantly... Rebel! –Fast Fashion brands will never engage in meaningful system change unless law forces them too, but fast fashion is currently low on the political agenda. Demand government action.

This month Newsletter Xtra brings you reports from Australia, Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, the USA and many more... 23 JUN | Sydney, Australia. Oh how we love a win! Yesterday 5 rebels who took part in a Sydney Rebellion 2020 action that targeted the Independent Planning Commission were acquitted of all charges. The rebels were charged with trespass, malicious damage (for writing in chalk spray & gluing hands to windows), and obscene exposure despite having scenes from the catastrophic ‘Black Summer’ bushfires painted on their bodies. Port Botany, Sydney Peterhead, Adelaide 10 JUN | Australia. Rebels blockaded fossil fuel distribution centres in Sydney, Adelaide and Tasmania, demanding an end to extraction and a just transition for workers. 1 JUL | Vienna, Austria. The highlight of the day was Greta Thunberg’s devastating summit speech. ""Let’s be clear - what you are doing is not about climate action or responding to an emergency. It never was. This is communication tactics disguised as politics."" JUN | Dublin, Ireland. Rebels joined Climate Case Eire and students from Trinity College Dublin to call on the Irish Government to deliver a Citizens’ Assembly on Biodiversity. 2 years ago the Irish parliament committed to a citizens’ assembly but still hasn't set a date. 29 JUN | Brussels, Belgium. Activists held a spectacular demonstration calling on the Belgian government to make ecocide a crime. 25 JUNE | London, UK: A vast carpet of living grass imprinted with a message by Nigerian poet and novelist Ben Okri floats on the River Thames. The mega-artwork launched the Paint The Land campaign that is being organised by Writers Rebel in the run-up to COP26. 24 JUN | Naples, Italy. Extinction Rebellion Naples, together with other climate activists staged an action in the Piazza Municipio to demand that the city achieve zero emissions by 2025 and involve its people in decision-making through a citizens’ assembly. 30 JUN | Washington DC, USA. Climate activists blocked five entrances to the White House “in solidarity with our indigenous brothers and sisters”. 28 JUN | Prague, Czech Republic. Rebels blocked the entrance of the Czech National Bank’s headquarters. Locked-on protesters occupied the lobby inside the building. The blockade lasted several hours before police intervened.

Despite declaring a Climate Emergency in 2020, the Basque government of Navarre has taken no decisive action. 14 JUN | Darwin, Australia. Arm in arm with a door! “We’re peacefully protesting and actively resisting the expansion of the gas industry, the fracking of the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory,” says rebel Julie. “We call on the Fannie Bay government to stop using public money to enable the development of gas infrastructure.” Fannie Bay is a suburb of the city of Darwin. 17 JUN | Perth, Australia. Sandwiched between police vehicles is the truck that rebels Carmen and Kelly drove into the entrance to the APPEA Oil and Gas conference. They then climbed onto the roof and locked themselves to each other.

In this issue: Italy’s G20 Rebellion | UK/US Free The Press | Finland’s Summer Rebellion | Indonesia’s June Rebellion | August Rebellions in Berlin, London, Oslo | Newsletter XTRA. Last month a village in Canada became one of the hottest places on the Earth. For three days temperatures in Lytton, British Columbia broke all national records, peaking at a staggering 49.62°C (121°F). On the fourth day it was consumed by wildfires accelerated by high winds. Lytton was burnt to the ground. The unprecedented heat wave that hit the Pacific north-west, a region usually known for its mild climate, is thought to have killed hundreds of people and over a billion aquatic animals. Lytton is consumed by wildfire. Photo: Today News Post The devastation is changing the conversation about the climate crisis. Global Heating is bringing extreme weather not just to warmer parts of the world like Pakistan and Madagascar, but the most temperate parts of the Global North. Unless we change how we treat our planet, these heat waves will keep getting deadlier and more common. Those hoping this stark reality would spark our politicians into action will be disappointed. A few days ago the financial controllers of the world's largest economies met in Venice for G20 talks. There was progress made on corporation tax, and silence on the climate crisis. But for each day of the summit, Italian rebels stood brave and defiant. They organised disruptive protests across the ancient city, and you can read all about them in Action Highlights. Police clear a blockade outside the Finnish Parliament Photo: Pietari Purovaara/ Elokapina You can also read about ‘Free the Press’ actions in both the UK and US that targeted billionaire media barons for minimising the climate crisis, XR Indonesia’s ambitious month of protest, which was sadly curtailed by their government’s mismanagement of the pandemic, and XR Finland’s successful summer rebellion in Helsinki, where temperatures have also been soaring. Over the last two decades 475,000 people have died from extreme weather events. The tragedy of Lytton shows that the next victims could live anywhere.

Support the Rebellion 8 - 11 JULY | Venice, Italy Rebels glue themselves around the perimeter of the G20 Summit. Finance ministers and bankers from the world’s largest economies flew into Venice for a series of meetings about money, and Italian rebels were waiting for them. Around 150 rebels from all over Italy took part in actions throughout the G20 summit, gaining an unprecedented level of media coverage and turning heads across the ancient city. The disruption was designed to deliver two key messages to the delegates. One; that meetings which define the future for so many should never be held behind closed doors. Two; that their collective inaction on the climate crisis has already killed too many, and threatens too many more. The blood of the victims of climate change pours down the iconic Calatrava bridge. 20 rebels delivered the first message by approaching the ‘red zone’ - the no-go security perimeter around the summit - and gluing themselves to security barriers and paving stones. For 3 hours the site became a place of song and dance, though police remained calm. If previous rebellions are anything to go by, steep fines and trial dates could still be incoming. The second message was delivered using a range of spectacular and theatrical actions. Fake blood was poured down a bridge stairway in solidarity with the 475,000 people who have died from extreme weather events over the last two decades. Children's shoes lined another bridge to represent the thousands more who will perish in the future. A group of mermaids lay lifeless along a canal to highlight the death of our children’s dreams, our ocean life, and Venice itself. The city is destined to be underwater before the end of the century, and could be classified as an Unesco endangered site within weeks. Poisoned mermaids lie dead along a Venetian canal. While the media and locals paid attention, the politicians did not. They made progress on reforming global corporate tax, but none on funding the global transition to clean energy. The G20 nations are responsible for 75% of global carbon emissions, yet since the Paris Agreement in 2015 they have largely ignored their emission pledges and invested on average $600bn per year into fossil fuels and related industries. The trend is expected to worsen as governments jettison other concerns in the quest for economic growth after the pandemic. State leaders of the G20 nations will meet in Rome in October to continue talks. Italian rebels will be waiting for them there as well.

Photo: Gareth Morris Rebels on both sides of the Atlantic have called out the corrupt billionaire media-owners who have minimised the Climate Crisis. In the UK, rebels targeted four press barons who dominate the nation’s newspapers. 7 tonnes of horse crap was dumped outside the joint offices of the Daily Mail Group and The Independent. A 2nd dung delivery was intercepted before it reached The Telegraph. Later more than 2,000 rebels and other activists met at Parliament Square and marched across London to the News UK headquarters, owned by the infamous Rupert Murdoch. Rebels were arrested once police got a ‘whiff’ of plans to dump a 3rd load of manure at the site, as well as for chalk-spraying the forecourt and chucking paint at the entrance. The march included activists from Black Lives Matter (BLM), Hacked Off, and the Muslim LGBT Network. The journey was spiced up by a lively Samba band, enlightening speeches, and pop up performances. A small pile of the crap intended for the doorstep of News UK. Photo: Gareth Morris Days before the action, 40 police officers raided an XR warehouse and an art studio, arresting 12 people ‘caught in the act’ of creating artwork for the march. The draconian move came as no surprise. When rebels blockaded Murdoch’s printworks during the September rebellion last year, the government illegally pressured the police to react with more force. It is now introducing legislation that threatens to outlaw even mildly disruptive protests. Part time clowns outside Fox News HQ (full time clowns inside). Photo: Felton Davis Over in New York, rebels staged a satirical circus outside the headquarters of Fox News (also owned by Murdoch). They were joined by BLM activists who’d protested at the same site earlier in the day. The action was hosted by clown versions of the TV channel's most popular presenters, and passersby were invited to play games that parodied the network’s dishonest programming. A punk rock band provided a suitably profane soundtrack to the evening. As one rebel present explained, ‘Fox News tells the biggest lies and they have the biggest audience… they reach people who could influence the course of events… and the world needs help right now.’ Learn more about XR UK's Free The Press campaign, connect with XR NYC, and listen to this Rebel Radio Special for more. 16 - 24 JUNE | Helsinki, Finland A roadblock dance performance of Britney Spears’ song Toxic inspired by XR Netherlands’ Toxic System Rave. Photo: Tiina Jalonen/ Elokapina Around 140 rebels set up a road blockade outside the Finnish Parliament in Helsinki. The police reacted with surprising leniency, and the protest continued into the night. Many rebels brought tents and sleeping bags, and by morning the blockade had turned into a beautiful campsite. This was one of a string of blockades held in the capital. Another major gathering was in Senate Square, the heart of the older part of the city, where rebels could take part in training or relax by listening to music and dancing. After four days the police moved in to dissolve the camps, and 120 rebels were arrested. Some of those detained were people who had joined the protest spontaneously during previous days. Rebels camping out in front of the Finnish Parliament. Photo: Elokapina For the 2nd week of rebellion, Finnish rebels gatecrashed a government event on climate issues and demanded to speak to the politicians in attendance. While some chose to flee the building via a backdoor, the Finnish Prime Minister and three ministers from left-leaning parties chose to face the rebels and discuss climate policy. The politicians refused to make any concrete promises about declaring a climate emergency, but all except the Prime Minister accepted that Finland must do more to solve the crisis. Overall XR Finland see their summer rebellion as a huge success. Their movement had grown online over lockdown, but these newly recruited rebels actually trekked down to the capital from all over the country to join the offline protests. The Finnish Prime Minister answers rebel questions. Photo: Satu Söderholm/ Elokapina The media attention was also unprecedented, with the rebellion covered on regional and national news. On the flipside, there was also attention from far-right groups, including outright neo-nazis, who spent hours shouting at the rebels, drowning out their chants with racist music, and threatening them with violence. Police did nothing, claiming the nazi goons had registered their demonstrations. XR Finland will file a complaint about the police’s disregard for their safety. While such harassment is new to Finnish rebels, it has in no way deterred them. Plans are underway to join the Nordic Rebellion in Oslo that begins in late August.

June marked the launch of a nationwide month-long rebellion by XR Indonesia. The ambition of the protestors matched the ecocidal decision-making of their government. Extractive industries have a huge hold over Indonesia’s political elite. It can be seen in the Omnibus bill that passed into law last month and that slashes environmental protections in the name of job creation. It can be seen in the effective dismantling of the country’s main anti corruption body. And it can be seen in the long history of farmland confiscations using unjust contracts and armed guards. One land grab in particular helped to spark rebels into action. This is not only a human rights issue. Half of Indonesia’s carbon emissions are tied to land use. On the first day of rebellion, rebels gathered in cities across the country wielding various forms of sound making equipment to ‘sound the alarm’ on the Climate Crisis. When the rebels in Jakarta reached the city centre, they held the government on trial for endangering the lives of their own people. They also projected messages onto the Corruption Eradication Commission building. Rebels in Jakarta hold their government on trial for negligence over the Climate Crisis. Successful marches also took place in the city of Makassar, and a campaign to amplify the stories of climate refugees and the victims of farmland theft was launched on Instagram. But this is where the actions started to falter. The pandemic has been poorly contained across Indonesia, and another devastating wave of infections, along with more aggressive policing, kept rebels away from the streets for the rest of June. Despite the rebellion being cut short, rebel coordinators believe public frustration with the status quo is reaching a tipping point, and the group is making links with other resistance movements like Clean Up Indonesia. For the time being XR Indonesia is continuing to interview victims of the Climate Crisis and extractive exploitation. View them on their Instagram page. Indonesian rebels help villagers grow food organically during the June Rebellion, breaking the cycle of fertilizers and debt that the government encourages local farmers to get into. 3 JUL | Gothenburg, Sweden: Rebels launched a campaign to highlight species extinction during their own heatwave, and called on their government to criminalise ecocide. “The fight against extinction feels extra relevant today when we have gathered despite the heat, which is nothing compared to the heat of death that is going on right now in western Canada. Such waves of death will become much more common in the future and large areas of the Earth will be uninhabitable before today's children even turn 30,” they said. 24 JUN | Wroclaw, Poland: Temperatures have also been soaring in Poland. Blood and heat death were the themes of this rebel action in Wroclaw against coal-fired power company Kogeneracja SA, part of the Polish energy conglomerate PGE. 25 JUNE | UK: XR Buddhists meditate outside the London HQ of ecocidal bank Barclays. Days later Money Rebellion launched it’s Earth Tax Strike. At least 3% of the UK’s tax revenue is spent subsidising fossil fuels and ecocide, so rebels are pledging to withhold that amount to fund ecological repair instead. More info here.

The sitters wore sandwich boards with comments from people in the Global South. In Hamburg, 2 glue-ons stuck to streets for over 4 hours and 20 rebels were arrested.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/06/18/global-newsletter-52/,"Dead mermaids line the beach while the G7 serves up stale empty promises. In this issue: G7 Rebellion | G7 Pass The Mic | XR South Korea | XR Muslims on Palestine. Subscribe to the Newsletter Outside of comic books and Hollywood blockbusters, it’s not often that a small group of people can decide the fate of humanity. But that’s what happened a few days ago in a conference room on the coast of England. The leaders of the world’s seven wealthiest democratic nations, and select guests, met for the annual Group of Seven (G7) summit. 5th place on the meeting agenda was a discussion about ‘climate and nature’. The climate and ecological crisis has been overlooked at such events for decades. Previous pledges by the G7 nations to switch their economies to clean energy, and help finance the transition for countries in the global south, have fallen flat. With the climate crisis spiralling out of control, and the crucial negotiations of COP26 just months away, rebels across the globe were determined to make this G7 different. A march to the G7 media centre. Journalists were told to stop overlooking the climate crisis. The result was the G7 Rebellion - a week-long festival of action targeting the G7 summit and demanding an end to the era of empty promises and disdain for the global south. There was a wave of pre-summit protests along the UK coastline, as well as coasts across Europe and Asia, highlights of which are featured in Action Round Up. Then there were the three days of flotillas, theatrics, and last-ditch blockades during the summit itself in Cornwall. We’ve somehow crammed it all into Action Highlights, where you can also read about ‘Pass The Mic’, a unique digital action that ensured voices from the frontline of the climate crisis were heard loud and clear throughout the rebellion. XR Sudan outside the British embassy in Khartoum, Pass The Mic, June 10th. Finally, we’ve got a report from a greenwashing extravaganza in South Korea, one of the guest nations of this year’s G7. It’s the first time we’ve covered the region in this newsletter, and shows the incredible reach and bravery of our movement. Ultimately, the climate and ecological measures announced by the G7 were pathetic. It wasn’t just more empty promises, it was old empty promises repackaged as new ones. The complacency on show was difficult to stomach. Amassed through exploitation and destruction, we cannot rely on economic power to diminish itself for the sake of poorer nations or future generations. We have to focus instead on building people power through global protest movements like our own. We have to use our mouths to speak the truth, and our bodies to stop a system that issues puffed up promises with a smile while driving billions to their deaths. The Group of Seven have failed to keep the world safe. It is our voices and actions that now matter. Not theirs.

Support the Rebellion 11 - 13 JUNE | Cornwall, UK The Day 1 march was a loud one, but earplugs were available. Photo Tristian Herbert One thousand rebels descended on Cornwall last weekend for the G7 summit, many arriving by foot or bike after epic multi-day treks. The disruption started with a dawn wake up call. Mermaids lay lifeless on the beach as a viking boat raised 5 long blasts from its foghorn. The G7 leaders were sleeping nearby. If they didn’t wake up they must have been wearing some pretty good ear plugs. Day 1 of the rebellion was all about sounding the alarm, and that’s what rebels duly did in an array of friendly, theatrical and noisy actions within earshot of the summit. The highlight was a march through the local town of St.Ives that featured a samba band and other noisy instruments. Among the hundreds of rebels in the procession were activists from the global south, each carrying letters for the G7 leaders. The cowardly summit gatekeepers refused to deliver them. Do your dirty investments need washing away? Call the rebel scrubbers! Photo: Chris Jerry Day 2 was dedicated to greenwashing, with actions that exposed how the G7 and their banks promise ‘green growth’ but then invest in fossil fuels and other ecocidal industries, while the media turn a blind eye. Rebels marched to the G7 summit’s media centre in Falmouth, home to thousands of journalists from around the world, and demanded they do better. Along the way, rebel scrubbers stopped at local branches of HSBC and Barclays bank to give them a good clean after all their dirty deals with the fossil fuel industry. In the evening, a flotilla of Ocean Rebellion ships projected messages onto the vast cruise liner housing the thousands of police needed for the summit. Slogans highlighted the vast carbon footprint of such vessels, and how fuel subsidies systematically destroy our oceans. 100 Penitents carry the sins of the G7 through Cornwall. Photo: Tristian Herbert On day 3 came the results of the G7 discussion on ‘climate and nature’. They announced a plan to help finance renewable energy infrastructure in the global south, and pledged to protect 30% of land and ocean globally by 2030. It all seemed strangely familiar. Both were old promises repackaged. The G7 also announced an intention to stop investments in coal unless it was ‘clean’ (using carbon capture technology to nullify emissions). It was a dismal failure to match the urgency of the crisis we find ourselves in. With so much unfinished business, frustrated rebels set up blockades to try and stop the G7 leaders from leaving. Dozens of rebels locked on and danced across one main road, while 3 rebels parked a van across a nearby roundout and let off smoke flares. Police responded fast and in numbers, using a cherry-picker to remove the locked-on rebels from the van’s roof, and clearing both blockades within a couple of hours. G7 proved to be an event of mesmerising folly that glorified our world leaders while they collectively achieved nothing. The race is on to ensure COP26 does not end the same way. Relive each day of the rebellion by watching these G7 livestreams on XR Youtube. Two arm-locked rebels try to stop the complacent G7 leaders from leaving Cornwall. 5 - 13 JUNE | Worldwide Companies founded in G7 countries have wreaked havoc in the global south for centuries. The latest example is Canadian company ReconAfrica destroying the fragile ecosystem of Namibia’s Kavango Basin as it drills for oil. Local activists who highlight and fight this exploitation are routinely threatened with violence. In the run-up to G7, rebels in the global north were asked to “Pass the Mic” to rebels in the global south and help amplify the messages and demands of activists already bearing the brunt of capitalist extraction and global heating. XR and FFF Brazil outside their National Petroleum Agency on World Ocean Day, June 8. For one week, XR groups in the north handed over their social media accounts and media resources to XR groups in the south. At the same time a Global South Uprising was launched to take advantage of this boost in media reach. 50 groups from the global south were paired with groups from the global north, who then posted about their partner’s actions, and liked and shared other groups’ content. Efforts were made to bring in lesser known voices within the XR organism, and build new bonds between international chapters. The action organisers, XRCOP26, provided financial support and media training to ensure any interested rebels could get involved.

Not all that calls itself green truly is, and the P4G Summit held in the South Korean capital perfectly exemplified this. P4G (Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030) is a glorified investment fund that helps funnel private and public money into green enterprises to deliver the capitalist fantasy of climate action with big profits. South Korea meanwhile was hosting the annual summit to demonstrate its commitment to stronger climate action. The 1st problem was that the summit guests included some of the worst corporate polluters on the planet. The 2nd was that the Korean government’s record on climate action is abysmal. It plans to build 7 new coal power plants at home, invest in more in Vietnam and Indonesia, refuses to raise its NDC target, and readily engages in the paradoxical practice of large-scale ‘logging for climate neutrality’. On the day of their president’s summit speech, Korean rebels organised a more literal take on this gratuitous greenwashing. On the plaza outside the venue, 13 rebels splashed the ground with green paint then attempted to unroll their specially prepared protest banners. The greenwash summit gets a greenwash entrance. It’s only fair. With the president nearby, the police had other ideas, confiscating ladders used to make rebel speeches and resorting to unusually aggressive tactics to disband the peaceful protest. Multiple rebels ended up with bruises. The Red Brigade, blocked off by security, could only look on in horror. Thankfully, help came from nearby citizens and protesting members of the Green Party. They recovered the ladders and restored access to the ‘space of truth’ where rebels could tell their stories and sing popular Korean songs with altered lyrics about rebellion. While some members of the public refused to take the rebels seriously, and some even accused them of being part of an anti-government conspiracy, many were supportive. A lucky few made it past the police barriers and ascended the ladders where they were able to echo the demand for genuine climate action and speak their truth. The Red Brigade are blocked off from the rebels by heavy security. 7 - 10 JUNE | Make The Wave: In the run up to G7 100+ local groups living on coastlines took part in co-ordinated actions.

Lautaro during Indigenous Emergency Day, London, August 2020 Photo: Talia Woodin The founders of XR reached out to me when the movement was just beginning. I was campaigning in London with ‘Stop the Maangamizi!’ to demand the British government pay reparations for its colonialist exploitation of Africa and the global south. Rebels and non-rebels came together to set up the XR Internationalist Solidarity Network and fight for indigenous and global south communities who have been attacked and displaced by imperialism and extraction. I am Muiscan. The Muisca are an indigenous heritage community in Columbia. I came to G7 to remind the world leaders of the climate debt they owe the global south for polluting our civilisations. And to make them understand that unless they act now, the world’s temperature will rise by 4°C, which will turn most of the global south into desert, including my homeland. I was part of a small delegation of MAPA (Most Affected People & Areas) who joined the rebellion in Cornwall. On arrival I performed a Muiscan spiritual ceremony, burning tobacco leaves to give thanks to my ancestors. When our group tried to deliver letters to the G7 leaders the next day, we were blocked by police outside their hotel. These leaders are captured by corporate interest and their summit pledges were not nearly good enough. My focus is on helping XR UK establish a Global People’s Assembly. Our dream is for it to be up and running by next year, and for it to involve 2000 people from all over the world. People’s Assemblies can get us out of this mess.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/06/08/rewilding_to_save_planet/,"A lot has changed in Yellowstone Park in the past twenty-five years. Healthy stands of willow trees line the banks of streams. Songbirds sing from tree branches. Beaver dams made of willow dot the streams. If you’re lucky, you can spot a beaver slapping its tail on the surface of the water. Twenty-five years ago, it would’ve been difficult to find any of these species. What changed? And what made this healthy ecosystem possible? In one word: wolves. Before the 1900s, wolf packs roamed across the United States. But by the early 20th century, wolf populations declined due to habitat loss and hunting programs. In 1973, the government, scientists, and conservation groups took steps to restore these dwindling wolf populations. The Fish and Wildlife Service listed the wolf as an endangered species and made Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem a recovery area. And twenty-five years ago, forty-one wolves were released in Yellowstone. Many species that had disappeared after the wolf populations declined, such as the songbirds and beavers, began to reappear. Before the reintroduction of wolves, Yellowstone elk numbers had exploded. Without wolves to hunt the elk population, the elk could overgraze on willow, aspen, and cottonwood plants. Willows, however, are important to beavers who use it to build their dams. As elk populations grew and overgrazed the streambanks, crucial plant species disappeared, which caused the further disappearance of beaver populations. Once wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone and could help control elk population size, plant and animal species returned. The wolf reintroduction program had a goal not only to restore wolf populations, but also the health of the Yellowstone ecosystem as a whole. This conservation concept of reintroducing species into a landscape to help restore ecosystem health is called rewilding. As ecosystems around the world suffer on the verge of collapse, rewilding could be a method to help save the planet’s biodiversity—and in turn, ourselves. Rewilding was first defined by conservation biologist Dave Foreman in an issue of Wild Earth in the Fall of 1992. A few years later, two American conservation biologists named Michael Soulé and Reed Noss built on the concept. In their now highly-referenced article from 1998, Soulé and Noss originally defined rewilding as a conservation effort that “emphasizes the restoration and protection of big wilderness and wide-ranging, large animals—particularly carnivores” (Soulé and Noss, 1998). More specifically, rewilding is a conservation method that focuses on restoring biodiversity and ecosystem health by doing three things: Since the late nineties, the method has been adopted globally. And the term itself has come to include a range of approaches: We began with an example from Yellowstone Park in North America because it is a well-known example, but rewilding has been used to restore ecosystems around the world. These global efforts include all three rewilding approaches. Read some case studies below: Copyright: Knepp Wildland In brief: Knepp Estate. A pioneering, promising rewilding project in the United Kingdom that turned an aristocratic estate into a biodiversity sanctuary. Some of the rarest species in the United Kingdom, such as the purple emperor butterfly, reside here. An example of passive rewilding that offers hope for replication across other rewilding projects. The rewilding movement has formed strong roots in the United Kingdom. A number of projects are happening across the UK. One famous example comes from southern England. Knepp Estate is a 3,500 acre estate in West Sussex County in southern England. Since 2001, it has been a pioneer in the United Kingdom’s rewilding efforts. For over 200 years, the estate was used for dairy farming. Much of the land was cleared for pasture, which prevented wildlife species from living there. In 2001, however, the estate became a rewilding project. The land was encouraged to heal itself with minimal human influence through the use of grazing animals. Unlike dairy cows, which emit methane gases that contribute to climate change and require clear-cut pastures, grazing herbivores, such as cattle, ponies, pigs, and deer, roam freely between forest and open spaces. As a side note, the difference between pasture-grazing dairy cows and free-range cattle is that, while both release methane, free-range cattle cancel out their negative impact on the climate by restoring habitat, as outlined below. Copyright: Knepp Wildland These free-roaming creatures can then lead to a whole chain of positive reactions across the landscape: by munching and trampling on scrub plants, grazing animals prevent forests from turning into densely-packed woodland. This dense woodland with brush and scrub prevents wild species from moving freely, foraging, and breeding—a poor habitat for wild species. Grazing animals can also disperse nutrients and seeds through their dung or carried on their fur. This helps distribute plant species across the landscape and allows for a richer mosaic, or array, of flora. As a result of these grazing animals and letting nature heal on its own, the results at Knepp Estate have been positive. Many rare or endangered species have returned: turtle doves, nightingales, peregrine falcons, and purple emperor butterflies. Many of these rare or endangered species use Knepp Estate as a safe breeding ground—one of few in England. The Estate has a number of statistics to be proud of, boasting the largest population of purple emperor butterflies in the United Kingdom; the frequent appearance of one of the rarest birds in Western Europe: the black stork; and all five UK species of owls. Copyright: Knepp Wildland This haven for critically endangered or rare species is a promising step not only for the United Kingdom, but also for global rewilding efforts. As wild spaces and safe habitats become increasingly fragmented, places like Knepp Estate offer potential solutions and glimmers of hope. Having wildlife regions like Knepp Estate also becomes incredibly important if we hope to preserve our planet’s rich biodiversity. However, Knepp Estate has recently faced some challenges. At the moment, Knepp Estate is an important wildlife corridor between neighboring St Leonard’s and Ashdown forests. This allows species to migrate safely between habitats. But potential housing developments of 3,500 new homes could turn Knepp Estate from a corridor into an island. There is, of course, fierce opposition to this housing development project. It remains to be seen whether this flourishing rewilding project will be able to continue providing a safe haven for rare and endangered species in the United Kingdom. Copyright: Pleistocene Park In brief: Pleistocene Park in Siberia. A famous example of Pleistocene rewilding. Not only seeks to rewild the Russian steppe, but also mitigate climate change in the process. Siberia in Russia is famously known as a cold and isolated place. Many may know it as a region of exile in Russian history. It is less known, perhaps, as a rewilding park. Pleistocene Park in Northern Siberia is a rewilding site. Run by the Zimov family—the elder Sergey Zimov and his son Nikita Zimov—since the late 1980s, the Park seeks to restore the mammoth steppe ecosystem; in other words, to restore the land to what it was when woolly mammoths roamed the land during the last Ice Age. How? And maybe more importantly, why? Pleistocene Park is a prime example of Pleistocene rewilding: the reintroduction of species to bring back the balance of ecosystems that existed before human contact. The Park uses large grazing mammals, such as moose, musk ox, bison, horses, yaks, etc., to change the landscape. These herbivores prevent dark trees from growing and help grass species grow instead. As a result, grasslands similar to those during the Pleistocene era have spread across the Park. But why does this matter in the first place? These grasslands are powerful players in the fight against climate change. First of all, permafrost, the thick layer of icy soil that stays frozen in cold places like Siberia, stores a lot of carbon. Warming temperatures from climate change, however, threaten to melt the permafrost. When this happens, permafrost turns formerly frozen organic matter into greenhouse gases. Grazing mammals can change all of that. When they graze on the grasses in the winter, the herbivores trample down the snow. In turn, the snow acts as a protective layer over the permafrost to prevent it from melting and releasing greenhouse gases. Another reason why grasslands can help prevent climate change is their light color. Because grasslands are lighter than shrubs or trees, the surface reflects sunlight back into space, which keeps the Earth’s surface cool. This is called the albedo effect. Copyright: Pleistocene Park Finally, Pleistocene era grasses have a deep root system that can absorb more carbon from the atmosphere than most modern plant species. Grasslands like those in Pleistocene Park can act as powerful carbon storage sites as carbon emissions rise worldwide. In addition to bringing back these grazing animals, Pleistocene Park is charging ahead with an even bolder plan: bring back the woolly mammoth. With help from the Church Lab at Harvard and the wildlife conservation organization Revive & Restore, the Zimovs hope to de-extinct the woolly mammoth. As very large herbivores, woolly mammoths can more effectively restore the Pleistocene grasslands. Scientists are able to bring the woolly mammoth back by using technologies that can edit a species’ genes. In this case, scientists edit the genes of woolly mammoths’ closest living relative: the Asian elephant. By giving the Asian elephant woolly mammoth qualities such as hair, these altered elephants can live in the Arctic conditions of Pleistocene Park. These efforts to bring species back from the dead is called de-extinction. There are, however, controversies attached to these efforts. Opponents question whether humans have the right to mess with the laws of nature. Opponents to the Pleistocene rewilding concept as a whole also argue that rewilding with exotic animals will not bring back the healthy ecosystems of the Pleistocene era. They say that landscapes have evolved too much since then to be able to go back. Additionally, opponents warn that Pleistocene rewilding could have too many unpredictable consequences that are not worth the risk. In brief: Tanzania’s Kitulo National Park. Translocation rewilding efforts to bring back some of the globe’s most iconic species: the zebra. An example of a holistic approach to rewilding efforts. When you picture African grasslands, what animals do you imagine? Lions? Gazelle and antelope? Zebras? All of these vibrant animals are closely tied to the African landscape. But imagine if they disappeared. This is what happened to zebras in Tanzania over fifty years ago. It is a familiar story that has repeated in places across the globe. Half a century ago, zebras were hunted to local extinction or removed to make room for ranches and farms. In 2018, however, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Tanzania reintroduced zebras into Tanzania’s Kitulo National Park in the Southern Highlands region. The reintroduced zebras included 16 adult/subadult females, six adult/subadult males, and two juvenile males. The reintroduction of these zebras is a part of rewilding efforts in the region and an idea that began in the early 2000s with Dr. Tim Davenport, Director of the WCS Tanzania Program, who designed the reintroduction. “It was thrilling to see the zebras moving across the plateau as they had for untold centuries. This collaboration proves that we can restore wildlife in once degraded landscapes—provided there is political will and good science behind these efforts,” Davenport said in a WCS press release. The rewilding efforts in Tanzania’s Kitulo National Park don’t stop at zebras though. WCS has planted 4 million indigenous trees and takes care of the region’s rare montane, or mountainous, grasslands. These replanted trees serve as corridors for other animal species to pass safely from one habitat to another. Like Knepp Estate, the rewilding efforts in Kitulo National Park prove that, as Dr. Davenport says, the restoration of degraded landscapes is possible. If after losing one of the most iconic animals in Tanzania—if not on the African continent—conservationists and activists can successfully restore them to their native habitat, then it is also possible in other degraded landscapes. With rewilding efforts at Kitulo National Park, Africa’s grasslands may once again be the site of numerous animal species—not just a place in our imagination. Copyright: Simon Fordham/NaturePix In brief: Tiritiri Matangi Island in New Zealand. An island sanctuary for some of the nation’s most endangered birds. A blueprint for other rewilding projects and an example of united civilian and scientific efforts. Tiritiri Matangi Island sits 30 kilometers east of central Auckland. This 220-hectare island is one of the most successful conservation rewilding projects in the world. Each year, it attracts more than 20,000 visitors. Visitors from all over the world come to see many rare species, such as the kōkako and takahē birds. But it wasn’t always a flourishing ecosystem. Like many of the other rewilding stories we explored, the island experienced intense loss of vegetation. When European settlers arrived on the island in the mid 19th century, they cleared much of the land for farming. The Maori had been living on the island for 400 years prior, so the island had experienced some human contact. After European settlement, however, the island lost 94% of its native bush. Between 1984 and 1994, a bold push for rewilding occurred. A group of volunteers planted 250,000 - 300,000 trees. This has led to the return of a healthy ecosystem. Now, sixty percent of the island is covered in native forest, and 40% in grassland. Birds, reptiles, and insects that might not find a home on the mainland have returned to the island. Birds like the takahē, for example, find a safe home on the island, where they can forage and breed. With only around 200 birds left in the total population, the island provides a sanctuary for these rare birds and prevents the species from disappearing completely. In addition to the tree planting efforts in the 80s and 90s, another reason why rewilding efforts have been successful on the island is the removal of unwanted or invasive predators. These predators, such as house cats, rats, and possums, were introduced to the island when European settlers arrived and caused native bird populations to fall. Their removal has helped bring back populations of native species. This method of rewilding, however, does not always meet approval. Pest removals in New Zealand have involved use of poisons, which critics argue are harmful to all animals, including native species. These efforts are part of the New Zealand government’s goal of being predator free by 2050. While there is some pushback to the methods involved in this effort, however, there is overall support for this nationwide rewilding project. These rewilding efforts on Tiritiri Matangi Island offer a blueprint for other sanctuary projects in New Zealand, as well as around the world, that hope to protect native species. Sanctuaries like Tiritiri Matangi Island provide crucial safe spaces that endangered or rare species in New Zealand wouldn’t otherwise be able to find. These sanctuaries with healthy populations can even increase populations in other regions that may be suffering. By providing a healthy, breeding individual to another species population on another island with few individuals, for example, conservationists can strengthen populations elsewhere. For these reasons, Tiritiri Matangi Island remains a crucial rewilding site that can help New Zealand restore its unique native species populations. Copyright: Tompkins Conservation In brief: Tompkins Conservation purchased tracts of land in Chile and Argentina to turn into national parks. An example of rewilding philanthropy at the forefront of nature conservation efforts. Since the 1990s, Doug and Kristine Tompkins have pretty much stood at the helm of global wildlands philanthropy. Kristine Tompkins, Former CEO of the clothing brand Patagonia, and her late husband Doug Tompkins, clothing tycoon of The North Face and Esprit, have contributed to rewilding efforts in Argentina and Chile for a quarter century. Together, they have contributed $170 million to rewilding projects in the Patagonian region, which stretches across Argentina and Chile. Their efforts have also raised around $45 million from philanthropists around the globe. Through the Tompkins Conservation and its partners, the Tompkins have helped protect 14 million acres of land and reintroduced many endangered species. Their rewilding projects rest on two main principles: 1. Buy land to turn into national parks, and 2. Set up wildlife programs that reintroduce native species to these parks. Their vision has led to the return of endangered species such as the huemul deer, puma, Darwin’s rhea, Andean condor, and pampas cat in Chile, and giant anteaters, jaguars, and green-winged macaws in Argentina. Copyright: Tompkins Conservation Before his tragic and unexpected death in December 2015, Doug Tompkins had felt a sense of urgency in buying these vast tracts of land in Patagonia. His vision was to buy up as much land as possible in order to prevent the sixth mass extinction. Kris Tompkins has helped continue this vision even after Doug Tompkins’ death. In 2018, for example, Kris Tompkins and then Chilean president Michelle Bachelet reached a ground-breaking agreement. The Tompkins Conservation would hand over 9 million acres of land to the Chilean government by April 2019. This agreement would put the land under the protection of the Chilean government and in turn, create five national parks and expand three. The Tompkins Conservation donations of fully-functioning national parks are the largest in the history of wildlands philanthropy. The Tompkins’ projects were not always well-received, however. When the Tompkins were first buying up land in Chile, locals eyed them with suspicion. Here were two multi-millionaire foreigners purchasing huge amounts of land. Conspiracy theories started to fly. Some theories proposed that the millionaires were going to use the land as a nuclear waste dump. Others thought the Tompkins were going to introduce American bison. Rumors and conspiracy theories aside, there were also many locals who were and continue to be opposed to the Tompkins’ rewilding efforts. Local ranchers held a protest in 2013, afraid of livestock removal and attacks from newly introduced pumas. Many local ranchers see these national parks as a threat to a traditional way of life, and a valuing of wildlife over livestock. Since Doug Tompkins’ death in 2015, however, public opinion has changed. Many Chilean and Argentinian citizens realized the sincerity of the Tompkins’ efforts. What at first seemed like a suspicious power move or cover up by wealthy Americans, is now seen as a project for public improvement to educate and inspire people on the beauty of Patagonia. Over the last quarter century, the Tompkins Conservation has shown the power of philanthropy. In its own way, like Tiritiri Matangi Island, Pleistocene Park, or Knepp Estate, the Tompkins’ wildlands philanthropic project sets a blueprint for others to follow. Whether through private or public investment, or scientific inquiry, global rewilding efforts need all the tools in the shed. As outlined briefly above, arguments for or against rewilding could go on for days. The case studies mentioned only scratch at the surface of rewilding challenges and controversies. Rewilding has many supporters and has had success worldwide, but there are also examples of failed attempts and many scientific, political, and ethical arguments against rewilding. For some, the idea of wild animals roaming their backyards is not a welcome idea. While there is a range of attitudes towards wolves and their reintroduction, Yellowstone Park’s efforts have faced pushback from local landowners. These opponents worry about their personal safety, and for farmers and ranchers, they worry that wolves will kill their livestock. To give another example from North America, some American scientists want to introduce Pleistocene rewilding to North America (like Pleistocene Park in Siberia). Others, however, argue that introducing large Pleistocene-era mammals to North America could reduce diversity of species or harm other environmental efforts in the Great Plains region, such as the return of buffalo herds to Native American reservation lands. In addition to the controversies, some rewilding projects have faced dramatic challenges. Oostvaardersplassen in the Netherlands dealt with public anger in 2018. It is the site of a rewilding project that went wrong. With few predators in the small 5,000 hectare reserve, the herbivore population exploded. But then came the winter of 2017-2018 which was much colder and more wet than usual. With such high numbers of animals in a small area of land with limited food resources during the winter, many animals starved to death. The population of red deer, horses, and cattle fell from 5,230 to 1,850. Almost 90% of the dead animals were shot by the Dutch state forestry organization, the Park’s managers, because they were starving. Another important debate in the conservation community is the history and definition of rewilding and its connection to the concept of ‘wilderness.’ Kim Ward, in ‘For wilderness or wildness? Decolonising rewilding,’ argues that restoring wilderness and returning to a landscape before human contact is an idea that erases thousands of years of cultural history. The concept of rewilding to a state of ‘wilderness’--an idea of nature ‘untouched’ by humans--is one tied to white, patriarchal colonization because it removes the indigenous cultures that may have existed on that land for tens of thousands of years. Instead, rewilding efforts should focus on restoring ‘wildness’ and be sensitive ‘to existing cultural interpretations, social impacts, and indigenous livelihoods,’ writes Ward. As with any environmental conservation method, rewilding requires careful planning and research. When we humans interfere in an ecosystem, we take on the risk of disturbing a complex web of interconnections. After centuries of disruption, however, rewilding offers one of many possible tools we can use to heal the planet.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/05/17/xr-goma-street-performance-dance-action/,"Two dancers in costumes made of plastic bottles performed in the street surrounded by curious passersby. Together with local artists, Extinction Rebellion activists marked World Water Day in Goma, a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Image Credit: XR Université de Goma, World Water Day Performance, March 22nd 2021 Holding placards, they marched through the city and stopped to perform in public places. A placard reads “Polluting the water is to stab the world”, denouncing plastic pollution and lack of access to clean drinking water. Goma, a city of 1.1 million people relies on Lake Kivu, one of the African Great Lakes, as its sole source of drinking water. The lake is not spared by problems such as urban waste, agrochemicals and sewage. Goma’s XR chapter was formed at the beginning of 2020 by a group of university students who use dance and performance based public actions to connect with the public. Antoine, a member of the group, said that performance helps to draw attention to the cause and to appeal to everyone’s responsibility, not just the government’s. It is also the safest and most non-violent way for them to express themselves and get the message across. Safety is of primary concern in a region marred by civil war with a weak security system. Fearing for their physical safety, they formed the group in secret at first, but later got approval from their university. At the moment, the group is composed of 25 members, among them two women, most of them “from modest or even poor families”. The parents are usually with them in their cause, but often try to forbid them to take part in actions because they consider it too risky within the country's context. Antoine explained that “Many demonstrations, peaceful or not, are repressed and sometimes with real bullets.” Many of their friends support them, but do not dare to participate in the actions. Image Credit: XR Université de Goma, Demonstration “Oil, no thank you”, March 2nd 2021 The danger doesn’t just come from the authorities though. By opposing oil extraction plans in the region, they risk drawing the ire of powerful international companies. Virunga is Africa’s oldest national park and World Heritage Site near Goma and one of the most biodiverse regions on earth. The park keeps making headlines with park rangers being ambushed and killed by armed militia groups living in and surviving off the park by poaching and chopping down wood. There are national and international laws that ban such activities in the park but the government continues to grant oil exploration licences to companies to drill for oil in the park. In the past, British oil company SOCO became notorious for bribing and threatening locals and for contributing to the destabilization of the entire region. In 2014 SOCO agreed to withdraw under mounting international and local pressure. Another company ‘Total’ which is based in France, withdrew from an area adjacent to the park in DRC in 2018. Yet the threat remains as the government is still open to the idea and Total is still active in the wider region. The company is currently building a huge oil pipeline through neighboring countries Uganda and Tanzania which has the potential to revive the DRC government’s oil dreams in Virunga Park. Last year XR Université de Goma joined the fight against oil exploration in Virunga National Park with a performance showing the beauty and destruction of the forests. Activists informed people on the street about the detrimental effects of oil drilling with a loudspeaker and held placards linking the oil business to violence. Image Credit: XR Université de Goma, performative action against oil exploration in Virunga National Park, October 2nd 2020 Before every action, they inform authorities of their plans and call on them to ensure their safety. So far, all their actions remained peaceful. In 2021 they hope to expand their group beyond their university and become XR Goma. They are also planning to create local XR groups in villages around Virunga National Park to facilitate environmental education. Besides that, they are going to keep denouncing exploitative and polluting behavior of multinationals in the region.

This month Newsletter Xtra brings you rebel reports from France, America, South Africa, Scotland, Australia, Indonesia and more... 4 MAY | Paris, France. 11 rebels chained themselves to the gates of the National Assembly during the vote on France’s Climate Law. The law came out of the Citizens Convention for Climate set up in 2019 by the French President, who said its proposals would be implemented “without filter”. But of the 149 proposals made by the 150 randomly selected citizens, 90% were abandoned and the rest drained of substance. The law was still passed by 332 votes to 77, with 145 abstentions. XR France said: “It is not an ambitious law. It is not a sufficient law. It is not a climate law. The government shows once again that it’s incapable of taking the necessary measures in the face of the major challenge of our century.” 22 APR | San Francisco, USA. Rebels in cities across the US demand that their President declare a Climate and Ecological Emergency. 22 APR | Washington DC, USA. Rebels deliver cow dung to the White House, emphasising that any climate plan other than zero-emissions by 2025 is bullshit. 27 APR | Waterdal, South Africa. Activists celebrated Earth Week by marching to raise concerns about the many mine quarries in the area that have been deserted for more than 15 years. 5 MAY | Heidelberg, Germany. Rebels blockaded Heidelberg Cement, the second largest CO₂ producer in Germany. The cement industry emits 8% of global CO₂ emissions, twice as much as the whole of Africa. 23 APR | Aalborg, Denmark. “You are cementing climate collapse” was the slogan of 30 rebels who blocked the main entrance of Aalborg Portland, Denmark’s largest CO₂ emitter. The cement manufacturer made a special deal with the Danish government that it could cut emissions by only 30% by 2030 - rather than 70% like everyone else. 7 APR | Rotterdam, Holland. Animal Rebellion Netherlands and XR Rotterdam occupied FrieslandCampina. The giant dairy multinational refuses to acknowledge the harmful impact of dairy on our planet. The placard: “Choose vegetables”. 30 APR | Faslane, Scotland. Three women from XR Scotland attached themselves to giant flower containers and blocked the north gate of the Faslane nuclear submarine base to demand a “Safe Green Future” free from the threat of nuclear weapons and environmental destruction as part of the International Peace Lotus Campaign. 15 APR | Narrabri, Australia. Rebels descended on the Narrabri offices of Santos Ltd, the country’s 2nd largest independent oil and gas producer, to deliver a statement in solidarity with Linda Whitten of the indigenous Gomeroi people who are trying to prevent Santos’ Narrabri Gas Project desecrating and destroying their sacred lands. 16 APR | Czech Republic. Across the country, local groups protested against the dirty banks (especially Ceska Sporitelna and Raiffeisenbank) who exacerbate the climate crisis by lending to the biggest polluters. The actions were part of the global wave of Money Rebellion. 3 MAY | Jakarta, Indonesia. Rebels “congratulate” Standard Chartered bank on funding the Indonesian coal miner, Adaro Energy. At Tabalong on the island of Borneo, Adaro operates the largest single-site coal mine in the southern hemisphere (110,000 tons of coal per day). 27 APR | Tel Aviv, Israel. Rebels entered the offices of Menora Mivtachim investment company with simulated oil tanks and called on them to wake up to the climate crisis. It’s the 4th time rebels have invaded Menora & they’ll continue to until divestments happen. 23 APR | Gothenburg, Sweden. Rebels protest outside the office of SEB to draw attention to the bank's financing of Arctic oil drilling to the tune of €3 billion. In a classic example of banker greenwash, SEB’s website claims “sustainability is about who we are and what we do”. 7 MAY | Washington DC, USA. Rebels smeared fake oil over Wells Fargo and demanded that the bank stop funding the Line 3 tar sands pipeline, which is on indigenous Anishinaabe land in northern Minnesota. 7 MAY | New York, USA. Rebels took part in the Stop the Money Pipeline coalition march on the head offices of BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase. Photos: Erik McGregor 17 APR | Cambridge, UK. Rebels demanded that Barclays and HSBC, Europe's biggest bankers of fossil fuels, tell the truth about their oily investments. Banks have poured trillions into fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement, funding death & destruction. 23 APR | London, UK.

From Alaska to Israel, lone rebels are sitting in the streets. They are facing not only arrest but oncoming traffic, baffled onlookers, and potentially aggressive drivers. So far more than 450 rebels have sat on the world’s tarmac and refused to get up. This is the Rebellion of One (Ro1). It’s powerful and it works. They may look alone, but each rebel sitter has a hidden support team, ready to step in the moment they are needed. It requires training and a great deal of personal bravery, but by using this tactic, a handful of rebels can stay Covid-safe and gridlock an entire area. In Action Highlights we report on the recent Ro1’s in Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and Israel. Earlier efforts in the UK, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic and Alaska are covered in a special Ro1 edition of Action Roundup. A rebel is force-fed fake oil in a performative roadblock for Norway’s Spring Rebellion. We still love a traditional Rebellion though, and in this issue we highlight the spectacular Spring Rebellions that took place across Norway and in Vancouver, Canada. With boats sailing into city centres, and performative roadblocks involving oil vomiting, it’s clear that traditional Rebellions will never go out of style!

April / May | Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, Israel A Ro1 wave has swept across Europe and the Middle East over the last few weeks. Below are special reports from 4 Ro1’s, with the rest covered in Action Roundup. Bydgoszcz, Poland: A rebel faces oncoming police. Her sign reads: ‘It scares me that capitalism is killing joy in people.’ Photo: Santus. Spurred on by their president’s reckless plan to keep coal mines open until 2049, 41 rebels sat alone in the roads of 10 Polish cities. Each rebel stayed put until the police carried them away, with the blockades lasting from 5 minutes to over 1 hour. A couple of plucky rebels decided that one Ro1 was not enough and returned to face the traffic a second time, resulting in a total of 44 blockades on the day. In Toruń, a topless rebel with ‘I have only fear with me’ written on her body sat in the cold for almost an hour. When police finally removed her, she was shivering so hard they asked her whether she was mentally stable. Toruń, Poland: A rebel puts on a shirt after sitting topless in the cold. The sign: ‘I shudder at the thought that my parents aged 80 will have to fight for a glass of water’. Photo: Nadia. This confusion summed up much of the reaction from the Polish authorities and public. Rebels were asked whether they were suicidal (rather than the system) and why they didn’t just protest on the pavement. Despite these mixed and often patronising responses, attendance at XR inductions has boomed since the action. The Swiss rebel’s sign: ‘I am terrified by the idea that children don’t have a future anymore because of the Climate and Ecological crises’. The Swiss Ro1 was extra special as it marked XR Switzerland’s first ever nationally coordinated action! More than 20 rebels sat in 8 locations with around 100 rebels onsite to support them. Some affinity groups were so new that the co-ordinators didn’t know they existed until the day itself. Now that's decentralised organising at its coolest! While a Ro1 in Zurich ended with a round of applause from the public, an extremely brave and determined rebel in Lausanne was twice dragged from the road by a driver. The steely rebel still returned to sit in the road before being arrested by the police. While the vulnerability of the Ro1 actions definitely impacted the Swiss public, it has also built trust among the regional rebel groups. XR Switzerland feels unified and re-energised. Some teams even want to make Ro1 actions happen weekly. Södertälje harbor, Stockholm. Sign: ‘I’m terrified that the fossil fuel industry will destroy our future’. Swedish rebels were nervous, but after a series of successful Ro1 blockades across 5 cities they are buzzing, and they want to get back on the streets. 16 rebels sat for upto one hour on main roads in Stockholm, Uppsala, Gothenburg, Malmo and Lund. The public reaction was mostly positive, with many sitters receiving thanks, thumbs up, and even flowers. The police reaction was more mixed though. In some cities traffic was diverted and the sitters had time to move on, but in others police instantly forced them to the sidewalk. One rebel in Malmo was charged with obstruction and held in a cell for 4 hours. He is likely to face a hearing and be fined. Malmö: A sitter is given flowers by a touched passerby. A young man gave the rose earlier. Her sign: ‘Baghdad 50°C I am terrified that places on Earth will be uninhabitable due to the climate crisis’. XR Israel’s Ro1 started in Ashkelon, a southern city that neighbours a major oil plant. The rebels found themselves largely welcomed, with sitters given food and drinks (it was an extremely hot day) and advice to stay clear of the road so they didn't get hurt. Blockades then started in Haifa on the north coast where reactions were more mixed. While one sitter received the wrath of impatient drivers, another was backed by enthusiastic students. A sitter negotiates with a driver in Tel Aviv. Her sign: ‘I’m dead scared for what my generation will have to deal with because of the climate crisis’. In the afternoon came the big push - a co-ordinated Ro1 wave involving 15 sitters blocking roads across a number of cities including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. You can watch these Ro1’s unfold in this multi-location livestream hosted by XR Israel. While police remained vigilant at the Ro1 sites they stayed largely hands off. One rebel was fined and another sitter in Jerusalem was arrested though later released without charge. A Ro1 in a shopping mall in Haifa, Israel. The sign: ‘I'm dead scared that the world burns from heat waves and fires because of the climate crisis and we go on as usual’. 3 MAY | Norway Fake oil is poured over Mother Earth outside Equinor's offices Photo: Sunniva Haugene XR Norway staged a day of dramatic actions involving over 100 rebels across 5 different cities and the target was the state-owned oil company Equinor. Rebel groups put on spectacular roadblocking performances themed around drowning in Equinor’s oil, with rebels being force-fed fake oil and submerged in glass tanks full of it. At Equinor’s offices in Bergen a professor from the nearby university poured several buckets of fake oil over a rebel representing Mother Earth and called for the Bergen University to cut its ties with the oil and gas industry. Rebels also unfurled a banner that read “Equinor is heading for disaster” while a special protest ship sailed in called the ‘Equitanic’. Equinor operates in 36 countries and continues to explore for oil in Norway without regard for the climate crisis. Rebels stage an opening performance in front of Oslo District Court. Banner reads: ‘Equinor - criminal oil exploration’. As is so often the case, it was the activists who were penalised rather than the criminals. 18 rebels were arrested in Oslo and each fined around €2000. We reported on the Norweigan government’s repressive tactic of mass-arrests and sky-high fines in our March issue. On a positive note, and possibly thanks to earlier international criticism, police showed more restraint with the rebel roadblockers, and their actions got mainstream media coverage. Norwegian rebels are dreaming up longer roadblock actions for the future.

Photo: Yvonne Hanson XR Vancouver started their Spring Rebellion in style, creating a space in the city centre for a crew of 5 rebels to sail their ‘boat of truth’ into. The pink vessel was named Tahlequah after the killer whale who mourned her calf. Over five days, rebels organised teach-ins, occupied bridges, and held meetings with indigenous communities to unite against a government that seems set on ecocide. Unlike the rest of the G7, Canada’s carbon emissions have increased since 1990. This is primarily thanks to the Canadian Tar Sands - the largest deposit of crude oil on the planet. Alone it contains half of the world's estimated emissions budget! 8 rebels were arrested shutting down Granville Street Bridge on the 2nd day of Rebellion. Photo: Ryan Walter Wagner & Yvonne Hanson Yet the Canadian government is pressing ahead with plans to ramp up oil extraction from the Tar Sands via the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion (TMX).This would increase Canada’s fossil fuel exports almost sevenfold when countries should be slashing their emissions to prevent mass extinction. On the Rebellion’s 3rd day, rebels marched to Lions Gate Bridge, a major access point into the city. They planned to occupy the bridge and call for an end to TMX and oil exports but were met by police on the way who told them to stop. When the rebels obeyed and peacefully sat on the sidewalk, the police arrested 5 of them! The crowd chanted ‘bullshit charges’ as the wronged rebels were led away. XR Vancouver responded: “When state actors crackdown on totally mundane activities, it means they are worried. If enough people sit down - this pipeline doesn't stand a chance.” To join XR Vancouver or find out more, visit their Facebook page or website. 1 MAY | UK: A rebel stops traffic crossing Tower Bridge in London.

It reads ‘I am terrified by how much suffering the climate crisis will cause’. There have been one or two Ro1’s every week since late March, and the action has sparked more media interest than any other. This Ro1 video got 400k views. A nationwide Ro1 will happen in June. 27 MARCH | Germany: A rebel is helped out by a passer by in Berlin. His sign: ‘I am afraid that my children will suffer because of the climate crisis.’ Over 100 rebels in 44 cities took part in Germany’s Ro1. With the country in lockdown since November, the action required online training and serious bravery from rebels facing angry drivers and bad weather. Watch this excellent video compilation of the day and hear from the rebels involved. 9 MARCH | Netherlands: This Rotterdam rebel’s sign: ‘I'm terrified for our futures because of the climate crisis’. 30 rebels trialled the Ro1 tactic in a nationwide effort that included blockades in Amsterdam and Utrecht. A bigger Ro1 is planned across the country in June. 13 JAN 2020 | Russia: Legend has it that this lone rebel in Moscow inspired the whole Ro1 movement. Here he disrupts a busy crossroads outside the Kremlin. His sign: “Our planet has great capacity. But it’s not limitless”. In 1.5 years of solo protesting he has been jailed for 81 days and arrested 22 times, most recently in Red Square.

The author begins by telling a story; learning of the Exxon Valdez spill while watching TV in a bar, listening to experts debate who was responsible for all the oiled wildlife, he realized it was him. He was responsible because his lifestyle depended on petroleum products, meaning he helped create the demand that ultimately caused the disaster. He resolved to utterly change his life. This book is about what he did and how he did it. Merkel focuses entirely on personal lifestyle change. We know that’s, at best, incomplete, as it ignores the roles of government policy, industry practices, and the economic realities that leave most people in little direct control over their footprint. If personal lifestyle changes were going to save us, it would have already. However, to look at a big, multifaceted problem, take full personal responsibility for it, and dedicate one’s life to addressing it - that’s the heart of what rebels do. It’s a lot like a Rebellion of One. Here are a few other books recommended by our team and our readers…. The ABCs of Global Warming: What Everyone Should Know About the Science, the Dangers, and the Solutions, by Charles Siegel One rebel wrote, “This book is the best overview of the climate crisis that I have read...I understand many of the issues better because I have read this book.” Siegel explores possible solutions and debunks common denier claims, too, in clear, accessible language. How to Blow Up a Pipeline, by Andreas Malm Not actually a manual on how to blow up things, this book is instead a manifesto on why we should blow up things. “Many rebels will be shocked and dismayed by this argument. If that is the case, then all the more reason to read this timely book.” Rich Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops by buying your books at Bookshop or Hive. The banner: ‘Climate crisis fears made me abandon my dream career’. I brought the Rebellion of One to my city in February because it is a simple and powerful idea that anyone can do, showing both determination and vulnerability. I am usually the trained de-escalator for our actions so it was great to be taking a stand myself. I was busy with other parts of the Rebellion Wave on the day, but I made sure I had time to think about the words for my banner. It was just me, the paper and the markers. When it came to the action itself, I was calm and I just tried to be present in the space. There was a mixed reaction; some people gave me a thumbs up, others just carried on with their rushed journeys, and some drivers got aggressive - suggesting I was insane for what I was doing. But I wasn’t afraid, because nothing is scarier than the Climate Emergency. I joined XR Poland after overcoming my own mental health struggles with climate anxiety. I knew I wanted to take some serious action and XR just looked so cool and inspiring compared to traditional environmental activism. I thought this approach could actually work! I have had to re-imagine all the ideas I had for my life in facing up to my fear of the Climate Emergency, including my dream of becoming an architect. But I do this willingly to protect what I care about most. My future is less important than the whole of humanity. I was detained for my Ro1 action by the police and issued a fine which I didn’t accept. I am now facing legal action. But every action I do grows my confidence in dealing with the police. I know my rights and the laws they must follow, so they are becoming less of a threat. Instead I can focus on improving how I handle being detained and sharing my experience with other rebels. Because this is what activism is all about: spreading the knowledge to enable us, together, to change the system.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/05/14/xrcop-xr-universities-uganda-worldwaterday/,"On the 23rd March, XR Universities Uganda organised an action for World Water Day. The group wanted to raise awareness to ensure the preservation and environmental protection of Lake Victoria. The action was coordinated by Aaron Niwarinda who is the coordinator and team leader for XR Universities Uganda and key members Judith, Brendah, and Moreen. Lake Victoria is a large transboundary lake which runs through Uganda. This Lake is hugely important to the local communities as it provides a number of uses such as its fisheries. It is also one of the largest lakes in Uganda and is a critical freshwater source. However, over the years, Lake Victoria has become intensely polluted with plastic building up within the lake and washing up on the shores. The pollution has had an effect on the local residents as well the lake's fragile ecosystems which many people depend on for their livelihoods. Aaron explained that the State Government has been slow at ensuring that local residents have access to fresh water and so many people have been fetching water from the lake itself. However, due to the pollution, this water is not pure and can cause sickness to those who use it. XR Universities Uganda organised a lake clean-up to fight pollution along the shores of the lake. Aaron explained that the XR rebels targeted the plastics which had washed up along the shore of the Lake. XR Universities Uganda also donated cleaning materials such as racks and brooms to people to assist with the clean-up. Aaron explained that the action itself also raised awareness to prevent people from dumping plastic and other wastes into the lake. Aaron hopes that the local residents will become more conscious of the damaging effects of pollution. The action itself was a huge success as the XR rebels were able to pull large amounts of plastics from the lake. Also an important message was made - that fighting pollution is essential to preserving Lake Victoria. World Water Day is an important day for stressing the need to protect freshwater sources. It is a day where XR rebels from across the world can stand up and fight against pollution and protect freshwater which communities from all over the world depend on to survive. Aaron and XR Universities Uganda have highlighted how effective these actions are at not only clearing pollution, but also at making a message to show just how important pollution free water is. This action highlights that XR members across the world must fight for the preservation of fresh water. For more information on XR Universities Uganda please see here for their facebook page.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/05/11/Anthropocene/,"Anthropocene. Ever heard that word before? It’s new(ish). The terms Holocene and Pleistocene might sound more familiar; they’re geologic names for epochs. An epoch is one of the smallest slices on the geologic time scale (GTS). Briefly, the debate about whether to use the term Anthropocene for our current epoch is between folks who wanna hold onto Holocene (which began around 12,000 years ago), and those—including us XR rebels—who say we must update to Anthropocene. Marked by the explosive uptick in toxic emissions, the Anthropocene began in 1950. For us, it’s a 20th century line in the sand. Among the Holocene holdouts, though, some have a huge financial stake in the rest of us keeping our heads in the sand. Or elsewhere. Photo: author. This diagram, from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), provides a pretty good path of Earth’s existence, showing how recently the Holocene and Anthropocene epochs—and we peeps—appeared. Kind of amazing all that we have done—for better or worse—in such a relatively short amount of time, but more on that in a bit. Humans like to name stuff: each other, places, plants, animals, objects, and historic events, to name a few. Names help us remember and distinguish things, even if the name we’ve chosen seems odd. Take, for instance, the red-bellied woodpecker. Red belly. Really? Huh. Bluebird. Agreed. (Mostly.) Photos: author. Yet, if a name ​does​ help us understand—and​ is accurate—that’s all to the good, right? Well… what if a name makes sense, yet implies blame? Massive, no-doubt-about-it, world-destroying blame? Even, or especially—if many of us never even heard of it? So, let’s examine this word, Anthropocene, why it’s so controversial, and why the overlords of the underground non-renewables would not want you to know it. The prefix, “anthro,” means human. You know anthropomorphization. It’s like when you look at a floor, and see a face. Yup: ​ that​ face. Or, when you talk to your dog or cat, ​AND​ answer back for them. The suffix, “cene,” means new or recent. Seems as though the suffix doesn’t make sense, right? Case in point, the Pleistocene epoch—the one before the Holocene? It began nearly three million years ago. However, names in the world of rock layers (stratigraphy) aren’t always scientifically meaningful; they can even be seemingly random, or certainly obscure. (The Silurian period gets its name from an old Welsh tribe. Go figure.) But the Anthropocene—the recent impact of people upon our planet—from 1950 on—is rock solid. It’s hard to think long term. That’s kinda programmed into us, so no judgment. How so? Well, say you’re 19 years old. If you start thinking about your own mortality, let alone that of other animals AND the world, how are you gonna win a game of Fortnight or Among Us? Go on a date? Get up in the morning and start those 10,000 steps? Do ANYTHING, for crying out loud? That said, looking back is absolutely necessary to get a handle on what lies ahead. As it’s probably easier to see someone else’s mess (and someone else’s mistakes) than our own, begin there. Ever had a sloppy sibling, roommate, or partner? It’s like that. You know how aerial/drone photos are all the rage? Their popularity provides a good metaphor: the long range of such images gives a fuller sense of climate catastrophes, such as… 2020 brought the worst flooding China has seen in 30 years. This aerial photo—courtesy of Getty Images—shows the devastation caused by a breached dam in Jiujiang, central China. A kangaroo flees the ever-spreading bushfires in Lake Conjola, Australia, 12.31.19. This iconic photo, taken by award-winning photographer Matthew Abbott, was shot midday. Image courtesy of Matthew Abbott. Nuclear bombs, fracking, and the biggest: burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the air—the main driver of global warming—are spiking ever higher. Today, carbon dioxide levels are ""higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years..."" and climbing fast. Additionally, as the world's ice sheets begin to melt, sea levels are now on an inexorable rise upwards: a slow, determined and all-encompassing giant. Storms, floods, and fires. ⇢ Waters rise, glaciers collapse. ⇢ Animals go extinct. The latest ​it’s-all-about-us​ crisis of the past century is, of course, COVID-19. It took a deadly rampage of humanity to awaken us to the deadly response of a destablilzed Earth. So be it. At least we’re woke. This planet doesn’t need us. It got along quite well without us for billions of years. Now that we are here, we must not only acknowledge the hellfire we have wrought upon our home, but do our very best to fix it. And if you’re going to fix a problem, the first thing to do is name it. The Anthropocene is a literal naming of the problem: us. With such clear and damning evidence, switching to an appropriate name for this epic epoch should be a no brainer—a fast and easy first step before rolling up our sleeves and rolling out repairs, right? Nope. Only geologists—or those familiar with that world—know that the naming process is never fast. In fact, comparatively speaking, this one is moving quickly. Too quickly for some. Furthermore, mostly fossil-fuelers—or those familiar with that world—know that their planet-raping endeavors are best assured if we all do not pay attention (but do continue paying them). You’ll meet the good guys—the scientists—shortly. They move slowly, steadily, scientifically. The heroes are Dutch atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and—IMHO—British geologist Jan Zalasiewicz. But let’s begin with the bad guys. Your soundtrack starts here: The Devil Put the Coal in the Ground, by Steve Earle. “Major fossil fuel companies have known for decades that their products—oil, natural gas, and coal—cause global warming. Their own scientists told them so more than 30 years ago.” “They knew about global warming… and did worse than nothing… they deceive(d) shareholders, politicians, and the public… about the facts and risks of global warming.” —Union of Concerned Scientists, June 20, 2019 The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) keeps a Climate Accountability Scorecard, ranking eight of the leading investor-owned fossil fuel companies on four broad areas: disinformation, business planning, policies, and disclosure. The ratings are: advanced, good, fair, poor, and egregious. Lots more info is on their site, but just check out the 2018 ratings for disinformation: In a 2019 article from “The Guardian,” titled Revealed: the 20 firms behind a third of all carbon emissions, the authors rely on analysis from the Climate Accountability Institute (CAI), which they call “the world’s leading authority on big oil’s role in the escalating climate emergency.” The CAI’s Richard Heede assembled both investor-owned firms (such as Chevron) as well as state-owned companies, the biggest being Saudi Aramco. Here are the four worst polluters from 1965 to 2017: And what about f##ckers? That’s frackers, btw, although the top hit in my DuckDuckGo search displayed an... interesting... adjectival form (one I have learned scifi fans will recognize): Fracking, a “nickname” for hydraulic fracturing, is when chemicals and water are injected into bedrock at mad-high pressure to crack the rocks and extract whatever gas or crude oil is there. Kinda like blasting into a vault and grabbing the gems. But, with a gasmask on, as one of the main pollutants released by fracking is methane—about 13 million metric tons a year—within the US alone. As stated in a 2019 Investopedia article, “Methane is a major greenhouse gas. Its global warming potential is 84 times that of carbon dioxide on a 20-year horizon, and 25 times on a 100-year horizon.” A 2020 article in Bloomberg Business tags the US company Halliburton as being the world’s biggest fracker. (About 70 percent of oil and gas extracted in the states is done by fracking.) Geologist and Professor Jan Zalasiewicz said that there has always been a strong link between geologists and the oil industry, and that a lot of research has also been funded by oil: “It’s useful to find out about rocks if you want to find oil in them.” When asked about Anthropocene—a name that might be used to blame frackers or anyone in the oil industry—Zalasiewicz points more to geologists, for whom an epoch lasting only 70 years can be a radical notion, especially an epoch including things such as, “... plastics and concrete as characteristic ingredients; that is quite a change for people who have been brought up in traditional geological mode.” But circling back to big oil and its slippery ilk, Zalasiewicz says their aid “...used to be called ‘The Light Side.’ Now for many incoming geology students —‘who are much more wary of the oil companies than my generation was’—it’s ‘The Dark Side.’” Further, Zalasiewicz adds this meaningful caveat on foreseeable pushback from entities that would be held accountable: “The Anthropocene clearly is describing the trajectory that Extinction Rebellion and others, Greta Thunberg, say very clearly: this is a very dangerous road for humans… the rise in CO2, the decline in species; all of these things are part of the description of the Anthropocene. And it’s an ongoing, rapidly moving trajectory.” Your next song: Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology), by Marvin Gaye. Let’s go back to the importance of carbon (in the ground) and carbon dioxide (in the air). ‘Cause it can be confusing. Carbon Dioxide (CO2)... Up in the Air Carbon (C)... Down in the Ground Picture carbon curled up underground, fast asleep in fossils and rocks. Zzzzzz. Snore. Zzzzzz. It is then violently awoken and dragged up to become fuel. Released into the atmosphere, carbon (C) combines with oxygen (O2) to become carbon dioxide (CO2). “Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat,” reports the US government agency NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). NOAA continues, “Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out.” Those bricks are heating our sky. For a visual, try this: aliens in a bubble. Each alien weighs a gigaton of carbon dioxide. Q: Hold the phone. A gigaton? What on earth is a gigaton? A: A gigaton is a billion tons. And it’s more, like, over the earth. Q: Back up. What is a ton? I mean, what does a ton look like? A: Picture a 1979 Volkswagen Beetle. It’s a ton (around 2,200 pounds/1,000 kilograms). Now, back to wrapping our minds around a gigaton, both in size and weight. NASA offers this chilling reference. Central Park in New York City is about 2½ miles long and half a mile wide (4 kilometers by 0.8 kilometers). Imagine the entire park covered in a sheet of ice. Next, that ice is thickened, making it rise a good 1,120 feet high (over 340 meters). That’s higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, higher than the tallest building in the entire Southern Hemisphere—the Sky Tower in Auckland, New Zealand. And, don’t forget about the whole width and length thing. That crazy-big ice cube weighs a gigaton. Enter, aliens, hovering heavily in our atmosphere, each weighing a gigaton: Of course, our troubles have nothing to do with aliens, and everything to do with us—what we do, and how we try to spin what we do. At first, there was a burst. The light-bulb moment occurred in Mexico, during a February 2000 forum about our planet. Then and there, the name Anthropocene was created by Dutch Nobel-prize winning atmospheric chemist and meteorologist Paul Crutzen (1933 - 2021). Sadly, Crutzen died during the time I was writing this article. Happily, a good 20 years before his death, during that conference in Mexico, he got ticked off. The results were most excellent. Listening to a presentation, Crutzen grew increasingly angry at the repeated use of “Holocene.” He stood up and stopped the meeting. Heads swiveled; jaws dropped. His words: ""I suddenly thought this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: ‘No, we are in the Anthropocene.' I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked. But it seems to have stuck.” It sure did. The Earth System science community—those less focused on the past and more on the present—found it extremely useful. It linked all kinds of changes: in the climate, atmosphere, glaciers, ocean currents, biology, and evolution. A key advocate for dropping Holocene and switching to Anthropocene was American chemist Will Steffen, then executive director of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Steffen encouraged Crutzen to write an article about it, which Steffen would (and did) publish in the IGBP newsletter of May 2002. As Crutzen further plumbed the depths of the word Anthropocene, he discovered that American lake ecologist Eugene Stoermer (1934 - 2012) had used the word before, in the late 1980s, both with students and peers. (Makes sense: it is an intuitive term.) Crutzen, determined to give Stoermer his fair share of the credit, asked if he wanted to co-write the IGBP article. Stoermer, described as a “laid-back scientist,” did co-author the piece, but didn’t pursue the word’s recognition any further. Crutzen did, though. Big time. And for those within the geoscience sphere, Crutzen is the man. In 2002, he penned a piece for one of the oldest and most respected journals in science: Nature: “Geology of Mankind.” A Nobel-prize winner for his work on the ozone layer (he helped discover how the ozone hole was forming), by 2002 he was the most cited author in his field... in the whole world. And mind you, being a scientist, Crutzen wasn’t merely pitching the name Anthropocene; he was developing and monitoring the science behind it, paying close attention as sites around the world were tested and measured for comparable results. Plus, Anthropocene makes so much sense—imagine: a name that is descriptive and useful. Accordingly, its popularity skyrocketed. Some eye-opening proof of its growing usage? Entering “anthropocene” into Google Trends, we see that in February 2004 it had no worldwide action; February 2020 marked the height of its traction. The spike at 100 represents the maximum search interest for anthropocene. (That’s close to ten million hits. [Two years earlier, at the start of 2018, the count was ”only” two million.]) Clearly, the word struck a chord, and stuck. But it also got stuck. Why? Within the multi-tiered official scientific ecosystem of commissions and subcommissions, geologists identify each slice of time. And chronologic dating? It is as essential as it is complicated. Not only complicated, but unprecedented. Never before has a new time slice been assigned to modernity. At the start of the last “new” one, 12,000 years ago (ya), writing hadn’t been invented (~7,000 ya). Nor were shoes (~ 5,500 ya). Not even the wheel (~5,000 ya). But art? Yes! (~ 45,000 ya.) And, while the earliest attempts to define and name the tiers of time go back a ways—the nomenclatural system of today began in the late 1700s—that ain’t exactly yesterday. Just to put things in perspective, bicycles weren’t around yet. Over the next few decades—into the early 1800s and onward—fossil evidence was used to define the different levels. British geologists took the lead—it was the 19th century, after all—and from around 1840 on, they pretty much set everything in, ahem, stone. Then, in 1913, just before World War I, the very first time scale with fixed dates appeared. Skip ahead 60 years to 1974, when the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) was formed. The ICS are the researchers; they date all those periods and such, producing charts for every site tested. The sites are called GSSPs (Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points). Each GSSP (aka “golden spike”) defines the lowest level—age and depthwise—for a geologic boundary. Kinda like a birth certificate, but for a rock (and much harder to certify). GSSPs are examined worldwide. It’s a ton of work (pun-intended), but the experts are optimistic. So much for dating. Now for naming. Because while the ICS does all the heavy lifting (and digging), the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) are the true deciders. And as you now know, the name Anthropocene is a problem. AWG, at the tip of the upside-down triangle, stands for Anthropocene Working Group. They and those listed above meet every four years for the International Geological Congress (IGC). The first IGC took place in 1878, in France, thereafter convening every four years. (Due to COVID-19, the 2020 meeting was postponed until August 2021.) Remember Paul Crutzen’s “Eureka!” moment in 2000? Here’s what went down eight years later: In 2008, the aforementioned British geologist Jan Zalasiewicz, then-chair of the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London, proposed to the international community that the Anthropocene Epoch be used as a formal geological interval. The paper he and his colleagues wrote led to the creation of the AWG one year later, with Zalasiewicz as chair. As Zalasiewicz put it, the key questions were, “Is the Anthropocene real geologically? Does it make sense? Should it be formalized? Can it be formalized on the time scale?” It took several years for Zalasiewicz et al to accept and agree that the evidence—“physical, chemical, and biological… (showing) the dividing lines of history”—was sound. “The Anthropocene matters,” he said. “We have something real on our hands, and we should try and do something about it.” Zalasiewicz, a veritable force of nature when it comes to pushing the acceptance of Anthropocene, is also relentlessly modest. In the interview for this article, he gave all credit to Crutzen, as well as the 30+ people in the AWG. Zalasiewicz has co-authored and solely authored both scholarly articles on the Anthropocene as well as those for the public at large. Said approach—reaching out to both audiences—is key, though writing for the general public is pretty much terra nova for geology. Geology is decidedly not in the fancy, shiny spotlight of science, which is an important point. Why? Money from funding councils—and attention from anyone—is often lacking. And don’t forget: big money can spend big money to cover its ass… ets. Yeah. Assets. Over two billion in US dollars. Cruisin’ the Fossil Coastline Artwork © Ray Troll, 2017 As for speed from within the geologic world, that’s not a thing. The GSSPs described earlier? Many established time units still don’t have one, including the Cretaceous Period (spanning 145 million to 66 million years ago). And it is now 200 years after it was recognized as a unit! The more recent and thus easier to research Holocene—which began 12 thousand years ago—only gained its GSSP in 2008. Crikey! So, no spotlight on geology, maybe, but people and politics in it? Oh, yeah. Says Zalasiewicz, “There can be a lot of politics involved. Stratigraphers can get very heated about their particular favorites and interpretations. And like a lot of science, it’s very difficult to hurry.” Regarding the Anthropocene, he adds, “For most time units, most people don’t care, except stratigraphers… with the Anthropocene, people do care… and so, we have felt a bit of pressure.” Acknowledging that vibe, in 2015 the AWG took action, suggesting that the Anthropocene might be formalized using a short-cut in the procedure, by simply choosing a time boundary (a ‘GSSA,’ or Global Standard Stratigraphic Age [technically, it’s allowed by the rulebooks]) — rather than going through the long, expensive, and complicated process of finding a GSSP ‘golden spike.’ The ICS response? Zalasiewicz: “... they hated that.” The AWG took note. Timed for the 2016 quadrennial IGC meeting—where the results would be announced—the AWG held a virtual (online) vote, and AWG’s members overwhelmingly recommended the Anthropocene as a formal geologic epoch – and to do so via a ‘golden spike.’ Furthermore, due to the aforementioned ICS 2020 summit postponement, Zalasiewicz reckons they won’t decide on the Anthropocene until 2024. The forestalled formalization notwithstanding, in late 2020, the ICS itself gave Zalasiewicz a leg up, as he became chair of the Quaternary Subcommission. As of December 2020, still quite new to the group, Zalasiewicz was not at all sure how the many voting members felt about sealing the deal on Anthropocene. “We need more than 60% acceptance at each level for it to go through… It’s a big ask.” Patient and understanding, he’s also tenacious and determined. “The main thing we’re trying to do is to demonstrate the reality of the phenomenon.” And as any XR rebel can tell you… No surprise there: XR is famous for garnering worldwide attention using glorious garb and stunning scenes within peaceful protests. Another group focused on global arts, science, and politics, has not only been on the stage with theatrical productions, it has also been at the bank. The Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW—House of the World’s Cultures), based in Berlin, Germany—are phenomenal fundraisers. And for years—since 2014—HKW has focused on the Anthropocene. “In the Anthropocene, geological and human history are deeply interwoven, making it difficult to maintain categories like nature and culture.” In 2018, the HKW acquired “serious funding” (Zalasiewicz’s words) from the German government for the AWG to test all those GSSP sites: €800,000. (In US dollars, 800,000 euros is roughly one million bucks.) Zalasiewicz estimates it’ll be sometime in 2022 at the very earliest for all the testing to be done, all the analyses assembled. The AWG should then, by the 2024 IUGS meeting, have all its ducks in a row. Leading the AWG now, and guiding this process, are Colin Waters as Chair and Simon Turner as Secretary. Only then, at the tail end of a very long interview, does Zalasiewicz reveal that he and two colleagues—paleobiologist Mark Williams and historian / humanist Julia Adeney Thomas—had just written and published a book, “The Anthropocene: A Multidisciplinary Approach.” No doubt the forthcoming reviews will help sound the alarm. (Prepare yourselves, librarians. ; - ) The reins of power are rarely willingly released. Therefore, we must not be complacent.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/04/26/10-facts-sea-level-rise/,"Source: Heye Jensen, Unsplash. For a long time the ocean has been our greatest friend. It has helped us to survive, explore, and connect with one another over many thousands of years. We owe our lives and many of the privileges we enjoy today to our relationship with the sea. But deep trenches have formed in this relationship that are manifesting in terrifying ways – and our species is entirely to blame. Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, humans have exploited both land and sea at ever-increasing rates for profit and power and our planet has become warmer and warmer as a result. Now our actions have transformed the ocean into a formidable foe: sea levels are rising faster than at any other point in recorded history and these swelling tides threaten to swallow up the land that many of us call home. It is now clear that this observable threat will have consequences never before seen in human history, some of which might just surprise you. Source: Jean-Christophe Andre, Pixabay. Human activities such as mass extraction and burning of fossil fuels have led to the planet warming at an alarming rate, As a result, our largest polar ice sheets have begun to melt and sea levels have continued to rapidly rise. If you thought that the melting of Antarctic ice was our greatest problem when it comes to sea level rise, then you wouldn’t be alone. The media bombards us with images of cascading ice sheets, lonely icebergs and suffering wildlife in order to depict the climate crisis and its impact on rising sea levels. While the Antarctic is certainly melting, the biggest problem is actually happening much further north. Greenland is currently the single largest source of sea level rise in the world. The large ice sheet that covers nearly 80% of its land is melting at a record rate, and scientists believe it now has the capacity to raise global sea levels by up to seven metres. In fact, according to NASA, if Greenland’s ice sheet continues to melt at its current pace it alone will subject more than 100 million people to flooding each year by the end of the current century. This means that low-lying coastal regions in countries such as the United States, China, India, and Thailand will be entirely swallowed up by the sea unless urgent action is taken. Source: David Mark, Pixabay. The ocean is silently and rapidly creeping up on us. According to a study published in Nature Communications, coastal areas currently home to more than 200 million people could be permanently below sea level by 2100. So what exactly will this look like? Here’s what we can expect if seas continue to rise at their current rate: Source: Masarath Alkhaili, Unsplash. In the last few decades seas have risen at unprecedented rates. Before the industrial revolution, seas would typically rise just a few centimetres each century. Since mass industrialisation and its associated warming effects, this has increased dramatically. In fact, in the last 20 years we’ve gone from a growth of about 3 centimetres every century to approximately 3 centimetres every decade. Why have the seas risen so quickly in such a short amount of time? Well, it has a lot to do with us. Our reliance on fossil fuels has caused global warming to accelerate and in turn speed up its consequences such as the melting of ice sheets that cause sea levels to rise. If we continue our destructive ways, we are ultimately choosing to surrender many of our beloved coastal cities and towns to the waves. It’s not just the ocean water we have to worry about, it’s our drinking water too. As the ocean breaches our coastlines it can mix with ground water supplies that are used to provide drinking water for local populations, making the water unsafe to drink. In addition to this, the mixing of saltwater and freshwater can damage water infrastructure and impact other vital industries that rely on freshwater – such as farming. It has been estimated that 30% of the world’s irrigated areas are already facing problems with saltwater intrusion and the desalination process (removing the salt) can be very costly, time-consuming, and environmentally hazardous. If we do not act quickly while our coastal communities begin to slip beneath the sea, perhaps our most vital resource will begin to disappear too. Source: Maruf Rahman, Pixabay. Just as our freshwater supplies are at risk, so too are our food supplies. Many industrial farming processes are heavily reliant on freshwater supply. For instance, the agricultural industry alone currently uses 70% of the world’s freshwater. If rising sea levels continue to interfere with water supply, the impact on the farming sector will be nothing short of catastrophic. A significant amount of the world’s fruit, vegetables, and other important crops (e.g. rice) will be negatively impacted. This is because many plants are sensitive to salt and so when low-lying coastal areas are flooded, the saltwater can prevent important crops from growing. The impact of sea level rise on the food industry is already being felt in countries such as Bangladesh – one of the largest producers of rice in the world. In fact, it is now estimated that rice yields in the country will decrease by 15.6 percent by 2050 as a direct result of salt water invasion from sea level rise. It’s no secret that global warming is making our weather worse. But did you know that sea level rise alone is a major factor in storm severity? This is because higher seas can lead to more dangerous storm surges (i.e. when coastal waters are pushed inland by strong winds). Coastal regions such as New Orleans in the United States have already borne witness to just how disastrous sea level rise can be in relation to storm surges. Hurricane Katrina was the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history: its impact was considerably worsened by higher-than-average seas that led to the storm surge that ultimately put 80% of New Orleans underwater. As ocean temperatures continue to warm and the seas continue to rise, coastal communities in high risk areas will have to bear the consequences of wild weather events that could ultimately have the potential to wipe them out completely. Source: Nicolas T Lopez, Pixabay. We are currently in the midst of a biodiversity crisis that will only be made worse with rising sea levels. Many important plant and animal species grow and thrive in coastal regions where sea levels are rising. In fact, a report by the Center for Biological Diversity found that 17% (or 1 in 6) of the United States’ federally protected species were at risk of losing their habitats to sea level rise. If we continue on our current path, we stand to lose a large number of important species that are integral to the maintenance of healthy ecosystems such as Hawaiian Monk Seals, Western Pond Turtles, and Florida Key deer. When coastal habitats sink beneath the sea and species begin to disappear, the effects will be far-reaching and the negative ripple effect will impact the biodiversity of wider ecosystems. This does not bode well for us, either, as many of the jobs, food, and services that are centred around this biodiversity (e.g. seafood industry) will gradually vanish too. Since the industrial revolution, our global economic system has been dominated by myths of unlimited growth. This has created unsustainable business models and lifestyles that have huge environmental consequences. This endless pursuit of profit and power, however, is actually beginning to drain our pockets too. Rising sea levels could cost the world 14 trillion dollars a year by 2100. Money will be lost on real estate, infrastructure, and disrupted business supply chains, and that’s just for starters. In fact, if we do not begin to prepare for rising sea levels now, it is estimated that between 0.3%-9.3% of global goods and services (i.e. GDP) will be lost annually as a result of coastal flooding. by 2100. While this might not sound like much, the consequences will be far-reaching. Many of the industries that we rely on for food, shelter, and leisure such as farming, real estate and tourism will see significant losses in the coming years. It appears that underestimating the impact of sea level rise is one costly mistake we don’t want to make. Source: Pixabay. Another surprising fact about sea level rise is that it has the potential to lengthen our days. As ice melts, more water is distributed into the ocean. This shift in global water weight causes a change in Earth’s axis as more water accumulates near the equator which slows down Earth’s rotation. Scientists often explain this phenomenon using the example of a figure skater who slows down their spin by spreading their arms wide – in this case as the water spreads around the equator, Earth’s rotation gets slower. And what does this mean for us? Well, our days will marginally grow in length over many years as it takes Earth longer and longer to complete its rotation. In fact, our days are currently lengthening at a rate of approximately 1.8 milliseconds a century. While we won’t likely notice much of a difference in this lifetime, our future days could look vastly different if we continue on the same path. Source: laurentriem from Pixabay Rising seas aren’t just shrinking coastlines, in some places they’re actually growing them. This is most evident in the Pacific Islands, where land mass has increased as seas have risen over recent years. One such example is the island of Tuvalu – which grew in total land area by 2.9% between 1971 and 2014 despite sea levels in the same area having risen at twice the global average. Scientists believe this is likely due to local storms and wave patterns shifting sand and gravel around the island and indirectly protecting it from corrosion from the rising tides. This fortunate discovery bodes well for the 11,000 people who call Tuvalu home as the island was originally expected to completely disappear under the water within the next few decades, though little consolation for the majority of resilient Pacific Islander communities as they continue their fight for immediate climate action in order to save their homelands. So, what does this interesting phenomenon teach us? If anything at all, it is proof that the effects of sea level rise and man-made climate change generally still have the ability to surprise us despite the scientific consensus as to its general direction. While this may be a small positive, who knows what other unpredicted effects will arise as we enter the uncharted waters of a world where our climate impact begins to bite back? Did any of these 10 facts about sea level rise surprise you? They certainly surprised me. It is clear that we are currently heading towards a potentially disastrous future with devastating social and environmental costs if we do not change our current course now. It might be too late to prevent all of the consequences of sea level rise, but it is not too late to prevent some of the worst. You can help turn the tide by joining the growing community of concerned citizens that are choosing to stand up and rebel against the current path of destruction. Together we can act now and create the wave of change that will ensure a safer, brighter future for humankind and the planet we call home. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

(Subscribe to the Newsletter) In this issue: Global Scientist Rebellion | World Water Day | Poland Rebellion Wave | Global Money Rebellion | Scientists of XR | Science Must Reads | Donut Economics | XR XTRA | Dear rebels, We have understood the science of the climate crisis for over 30 years. The first IPCC report, where the world’s scientific community set out the scale of the problem, came out in 1990. But our governments chose not to act then, and still fail us today. It is from that failure that protest movements like XR have sprung, and scientists have played a generous role in supporting our rebellion and offering us expertise. But, though integrated with our movement, they have tended to stay away from direct action. All that changed during the UK’s September Rebellion last year. Two physicists threw green paint over the Royal Society in London, the oldest scientific institution in the world, and called on scientists to engage in civil disobedience. Scientist Rebellion was born. Scientists in Lausanne, Switzerland prepare for direct action. Scientist Rebellion believes that scientists and their institutions must act like the climate crisis is an emergency - and speaking about an emergency is not enough. Only non-violent civil resistance truly validates the science, and shows people how urgent this situation is. Now Scientist Rebellion has hundreds of members all over the world, from Australia to Kenya to Mexico. They recently came together for 4 days of global action, which you can read about in Action Highlights. You can also learn about the latest climate science in a specially curated Must Reads.

Over 100 scientists around the world engaged in direct action to expose the terrifying extent of the climate crisis. The 4 days of disruption marked the first Global Scientist Rebellion. The rationale for the rebellion was that unless those best placed to understand our emergency behave like we’re in one, the rest of the world will not. Or as Einstein put it; “Those who have the privilege to know have the duty to act”. Scientists went on hunger strike across Europe and in Djibouti, Mexico, Australia and the US. The hunger strikes lasted from 4 days to over 2 weeks in the case of a software engineer in Djibouti. This Djibouti software engineer, maths teacher, and rebel went on hunger strike for 18 days. In cities across Spain, Germany and Switzerland, scientists plastered the walls of universities and research centres with scientific papers warning of the severe destruction to come if climate science is ignored. In London, 2 scientists were arrested for throwing paint at the News Building, the headquarters of Murdoch’s media empire. His newspapers and TV news channels have persistently misled and misinformed the public about the climate crisis. Political buildings were also targeted. In Berlin scientists tried to plaster climate crisis papers to the Federal Ministry of Food & Agriculture, but were quickly intercepted and fined by police. It took 3 hours, a specialist team, and over a dozen police officers to cut away one scientist who locked himself to the gates of Downing Street where the British Prime Minister resides. Scientists in Geneva, Switzerland plaster their university with scientific papers. Meanwhile, in lecture halls and campus spaces rebel scientists held teach-ins where the normal syllabus was replaced with lessons on the climate crisis. The tactic of civil disobedience was clearly endorsed. Scientist Rebellion is just 6 months old but has academic activists in 20 countries. Plans are already underway for the 2nd Global Scientist Rebellion from June 21st - 28th.

But in Africa, rebel groups in 11 countries came together to highlight what it’s like to live under constant water stress right now in the present day. XR Université de Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo denounced plastic pollution and lack of access to clean drinking water in a powerful street performance, with two dancers in costumes made from discarded plastic bottles. Rebels in Sudan protested the fact that nearly half their people don’t have access to safe drinking water. Groundwater can be salty and rural communities often depend on rainwater collected in small pits and ponds which tend to dry out over summer. Drinking water then has to be laboriously transported on donkey carts over great distances. Sudanese rebels on World Water Day. The big banner features the Qur’an quote; “We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe!” South African rebels in Vaal produced a video about people’s relationships to water, covering sewage problems and how a local coal mine’s excessive use of water left local residents without an adequate supply. XR Sierra Leone meanwhile made it onto national television. Together with a national school club, rebels raised awareness on proper water management, and linked their regional water crisis to climate change and migration. Other groups, including one in Uganda and another in South Africa, used World Water Day to launch ambitious tree-planting actions. Many more actions took place in Nigeria, Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia and Senegal. Rebels of XR Uganda hold tree saplings before beginning a tree-planting action. XR COP, the rebel group focussing on the upcoming climate summit COP26, organized a special fundraiser to support these African World Water Day actions. In their view, the water issue is not discussed enough among activists in the global north whereas for African activists it is a very real threat to their daily lives. Days later, the group hosted 'The Water Crisis IS the Climate Crisis' - a webinar featuring frontline activists and which connects the two crises via issues such as fracking, mining, changing weather patterns and water privatization. 24 - 27 FEB | Poland ‘Czas na Bunt’ (Time to Rebel) is painted on rebels outside Parliament. Photo: Karo Zieba XR Poland has relaunched itself as a movement. Over four days of rebellion across 11 cities, rebels engaged in actions that have set a new disruptive benchmark for the region. The Polish rebels locked, glued, and chained themselves to government buildings, media outlets, and across major roads. The result has been an unprecedented amount of media attention and an influx of new recruits. The rebellion wave started in Warsaw with rebels silently tying ribbons to barricades around the Polish parliament. As police insisted they move on, each rebel had a letter of the phrase ‘Time to Rebel’ painted on their backs. A Rebellion of One in Wrocław. Lone rebels (with hidden support teams) blocked roads across Poland. The banner: ‘Climate crisis fears made me drop my dream career’. Photo: Cyjon & Alicja Kozuchowska The solemn ceremony marked the passing of a deadline that XR Poland had set 3 months before - a deadline for the government to announce a climate citizens’ assembly. Rebels knew it would not be met. Their government is led by a man who boasted of having 200 years’ worth of coal at a climate summit. But XR Poland set the date more for themselves. Until now, rebel actions in Poland were mostly artistic and performative, but XR Poland wanted this rebellion to be more disobedient and disruptive. Within a few hours it was clear that their wish had been granted. In Warsaw, a rebel glued herself to an entrance to Parliament, eventually choosing to release herself with the help of a fellow rebel and some acetone, after police and firefighters puzzled over her predicament for 5 hours. The next day, a dozen rebels braved heavy rain to stay locked together across a major road for 8 and a half hours - a national record. In Krakow, rebels blockaded an Orlen gas station. As well as refining oil and selling petrol, Orlen’s CEO owns most of Poland’s local newspapers, all of which have remained silent about the climate crisis. Rebels in Toruń chain themselves to the gates of Radio Maryja - a media group infamous for spreading climate denial and far-right conspiracy theories. Photo: Marek Krupecki In Wrocław, police used an electric saw to cut through the D-locks of road-bound rebels, and things got dicey. No ear plugs were provided, and one of the locks was still bound to an operating street light. Thankfully, nobody was electrocuted. One rebel was seriously injured in Bydgoszcz though; local police didn’t understand that the pipes joining the arms of a dozen rebels were genuine locks and tried to wrestle them apart. While arrests were minimal overall, many rebels were brought into police stations to present their ID cards. This could lead to court hearings and potential fines. The judicial process is slow though. Hearings for the September 2020 Rebellion are still to start. XR Poland is thrilled by how well it met its own deadline. The movement is now bigger than ever and seen as radical by a much more interested media. As for interest from the public - XR Poland has been forced to upgrade its Zoom software.

Youtube: 10 Yrs to Transform the Future of Humanity or Destabilize the Planet (8 min)Scientist Johan Rockström delivers a simple message: the systems that regulate our climate are destabilizing and could make the Earth uninhabitable for our children. Scientist Rebellion: The ScienceA primer on climate science split into sections on climate feedbacks, rising seas, ecological breakdown, food & water security, the human cost, climate solutions, non-violent resistance. Frontiers: Underestimating the Challenges of Avoiding a Ghastly FutureAn article penned this year by 17 scientists that provides a sobering assessment of the state of the planet. It warns world leaders that a ghastly future awaits us if action isn’t taken. WWF: Living Planet Report 2020This comprehensive report shows how our destruction of nature is having catastrophic impacts on wildlife populations and human health, and calls for an economic system that values nature. PNAS: Future of the Human Climate NicheAn article that predicts how, over the next 50 years, one third of the global population will experience mean annual temperatures currently only found in the Sahara desert. BioScience: World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency11,000 scientists “tell it like it is”. They make a clear case for why the planet Earth is facing a climate emergency and outline political steps that should be taken immediately. Is endless economic growth the enemy of our planet? Turning traditional thinking on its head, Kate Raworth’s radical book argues for a new kind of economics fit for the 21st century. Her model, ‘The Doughnut’, identifies a “safe and just space” for humanity, where humans have everything we need to survive and thrive without exceeding the boundaries of our planet. The Doughnut marks out a space where foundational human needs like peace, education, and equality are met, without destroying our natural world through pollution, biodiversity loss and climate injustice. But to enter this Doughnut space, we need to ditch our obsession with endlessly expanding GDP, and move towards a circular economy where we value more than goods and services. Doughnut Economics has been hugely influential amongst sustainable development thinkers, progressive businesses, and political activists. Raworth has also presented it to audiences ranging from the UN General Assembly to the Occupy movement. Listen to Kate Raworth discuss her model on the XR podcast and learn more here. Here is another book recommended by our readers… Active Hope: How to Face the Mess We’re in Without Going Crazy, by Joanna Macy and Chris Johnstone “A really inspiring manifesto for facing the huge challenges and choosing the only psychologically viable way forward—getting actively involved in the solutions.” (Alister) Not only is Joanna Macy a scholar in systems theory and deep ecology, she’s also who conservation scientists seek out for insight on accomplishing change.

I have just completed my first ever non-violent direct action for Scientist Rebellion and I feel relieved and surprised at how well it went! More scientists need to step up and use their position to speak out, and that’s what I’m trying to do. Because the conventional ways of influencing government have been exhausted and change isn’t coming fast enough. That’s why we just stuck giant copies of scientific research papers to the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Berlin. I come from a rebellious family, so those close to me are supportive of what I am doing, although some friends are skeptical it will make a difference. But I am getting their attention, and I am helping to reach more people because I am not really known for putting myself out there like this. Being part of Scientist Rebellion is about being the kind of person I want to be and showing others you can do something about the ecological crisis. And if I want more of my scientific colleagues to act, first I need to do it myself. Action inspires action! I have made so many new friends through XR and it is relaxing to be around like-minded people. Even though it can be hard to fit the activism around my job, it is so rewarding and a source of strength because I don’t feel I am alone in trying to help save the world. As the Climate Emergency is a Health Emergency, I am bringing more of what I am learning into the way I teach to try and prepare medical students for what they will face in the future. I will definitely get involved with more research paper poster drops and bring more people with me next time!

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/03/31/xrcop-global-conversations/,"XR COP Action recently linked groups of rebels from all over the world to discuss and share their ideas and experiences in the run up to COP26. This is hugely important as it allows rebels to build upon each other's experience and for rebels to learn about actions around the world. Over 25 groups were involved in this project from Countries such as: UK, Sweden, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Senegal, Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, India, Canada, Argentina and the USA. These conversations show that, despite our many countries and languages, we share one common goal as rebels - to fight for our earth. This image is of Rebels from XR Stockholm, Sweden. Recently, XR Stockholm and XR Sheffield had an incredibly productive conversation. Both groups exchanged ideas on how to build actions during the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has prevented XR from a number of actions due to the safety of our rebels. However, XR Stockholm and XR Sheffield shared ideas on how groups can get creative to get our message out into the wider world and how campaigns can take many different forms other than protests. Both groups agreed that these sorts of conversations truly make XR global and more need to happen in the future. This allows rebels to learn from each other as well as keeping rebels informed of actions around the world. Image of a XR protest in San Francisco by XR San Francisco Bay. XR San Francisco Bay and XR Chesire met and discussed the importance of actions at the upcoming COP26. This is a hugely important climate summit and XR groups around the world recognise the need to take action to put pressure on their governments to ensure that COP26 is not a COP out. Both groups discussed similarities of the challenges they have in putting pressure on their Governments to take action. They agreed that: “The challenge for countries like the US and UK is to encourage our leaders to recognise the global injustice that countries least responsible for Climate Change are often most impacted by the consequences. We must show leadership and cut carbon emissions faster and sooner than those countries with less developed economies.” XR Chesire and XR San Francisco Bay also highlighted an important point the groups must consider moving forward in the run up to COP. They stated that future conversations must include how XR can organise ourselves to be an effective nuisance to drive change. Image by XR Buenos Aires, Argentina (90% intentional fires Winter 2020). XR Buenos Aires and XR Barcelona discussed the hugely important point of the reversal of neocolonialism. They discussed neo-colonial dynamics of capitalism and how they are used for the benefit of the economies of the global north, at the expense of the global south and MAPAs. This needs to change. Another important discussion was on the topic of embracing the worldview of indigenous groups and critically deconstructing ourselves by accepting our place and privilege. The two groups also discussed ways in which rebels can educate each other on the actions taking place around the world by different XR groups. This can be done in many different ways, through readings and films created by rebels. Image of XR Protest in England, UK. The global conversations were hugely successful in highlighting the importance of communication between different XR groups. Every group encourages more of these conversations to connect rebels and increase solidarity within our movement at a global level. Finally, these conversations highlight that, no matter where we are in the world, all of us together want to fight for a fairer, greener, and brighter future. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/03/12/xr-any-solutions/,"It’s sometimes asked why Extinction Rebellion (XR) doesn’t set out any solutions to the climate and ecological emergency. Some critics argue that highlighting the problems is easy, but that XR isn’t doing the difficult part: providing the answers. It’s true that attempting to tackle the climate and ecological emergency is an incredibly complex and challenging task, but it isn’t an impossible mountain to climb. The truth is that the solutions already exist - what doesn’t currently exist is the political will to implement them rapidly enough - changing this is what XR aims to do. XR is trying to force action, rather than just highlighting the failure of government and institutions. © XR Jamaica One reason we’re not proposing solutions is that they’re already well known. There is little benefit in us trying to reinvent the wheel when deliverable solutions exist and are well documented. We know that climate change is being driven by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, and that these are increasing as a result of human activity. In order to prevent further global warming we need to reduce these emissions. Organisations like the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales have set out in detail how we can achieve the necessary reductions in emissions. This will require systemic actions such as ending the use of fossil fuels and individual changes like reducing our consumption of meat and dairy. Another major component of the climate and ecological emergency is the loss of biodiversity. We’re currently in the midst of our planet’s sixth mass extinction event and once again the primary driver for this is human activity. We know that loss of biodiversity is being caused by things such as loss of habitats, use of chemicals and climate change. Knowing what’s causing it means we also know exactly what needs to change in order to prevent it. The problem isn’t being unaware of the solutions, it’s the dangerous unwillingness to implement them. This is the problem that XR is addressing. © Shiraaz Mohamed *(that I like) When people complain about a lack of solutions, this often translates into either: A quick Google search of “what are the solutions to climate change?” offers plenty of answers. This obviously comes with the standard health warning that not everything on the internet is true. However, sticking with reputable sources tends to result in similar solutions coming up fairly consistently. These same suggestions can also be found in numerous books, articles such as this one, TV programmes and films on the subject. You’re also likely to find some of them in the environmental action plans of governments and businesses (albeit, often in a more limited or diluted form than the situation demands). Greater caution is advisable when looking at these; in some cases their inclusion stems from a genuine desire to protect the planet, but in others they’re just greenwashing. So, the truth is, we know what needs to be done - absence of solutions isn’t the issue, it’s unwillingness to put them into practice at the scale and pace that’s required. XR’s first demand is that governments Tell the Truth about the climate and ecological emergency. Doing this will help address the problem of people not knowing enough about the subject. We need as many people as possible to understand our present situation and the actions needed to prevent it getting worse. Our second demand is that governments Act Now and take immediate action on the massive scale that’s required to address the climate and ecological emergency. Given the solutions are well documented and many are already being implemented to some extent, lack of awareness often isn’t the issue. The problem is that these solutions aren’t ones that many individuals, politicians or businesses want to hear or implement. For example, there’s widespread understanding that air travel generates harmful emissions and that reducing it would be good for the environment. Research has shown that a large proportion of these emissions are generated by a small minority. There’s little argument that the solution requires reductions in air travel and the primary obstacle is reluctance to do this. This manifests itself not only in the unwillingness of some individuals to amend their behaviour, but also the reluctance of governments to incentivise or force change through means such as frequent flyer levies or other legislation. ‘Save the World or Aviation’ © XR Sverige It’s a mistake to assume that people in organisations such as XR like these solutions any more than anyone else does. It may be the case, but sometimes the only difference is an acceptance of their necessity. This can simply be the result of a greater appreciation of the terrible consequences of inaction. This interview with an airline pilot illustrates how someone can love travelling and be reliant on the airline industry for their income, yet still recognise the need for change. Accepting that something needs to happen and liking it are not the same thing. Air travel also provides a perfect example of the dangers of being drawn towards seductive hypothetical solutions that don’t currently exist. There’s very little prospect of cost-effective low emission airliners being available anytime soon, yet many people still prefer to focus on this as the way forward. It may happen in the future, but the time-frame is incompatible with the speed at which we need to reduce emissions to prevent catastrophic climate change. Think of the climate and ecological emergency like an illness: climate scientists are telling us that our planet is seriously unwell. However, the good news is that most don’t think it’s terminal (at least not yet) and there are still plenty of things we can do about it. As a patient, once we’d got past the initial shock of learning we were ill, we’d probably be very glad to hear that treatments were available that could save us. It’s also likely that we’d want to get started with our treatment as soon as possible. This is exactly the position we’re in with the climate and ecological emergency, but we’re not responding to it in the same way. Rather than feeling positive that a cure exists, there’s often a focus on the downsides of the treatment. Like treatment for a serious illness, solutions to the climate crisis may have a negative impact on our lives. They may mean that individuals in wealthier countries are no longer able to lead the same lifestyles as before; or that governments can no longer rely on the same cheap, dirty fuel sources. However, these undesirable consequences are much easier to accept once we recognise the simple truth that they’re necessary in order to save ourselves and others. We know that many people are already suffering the consequences of the levels of global warming happening today. However, many still seek to delay action, even though the projected consequences of doing so are much worse. When a person is diagnosed with cancer, the aim is normally to treat it as quickly as possible. In most circumstances people don’t ask how long they can delay treatment or how far they could allow the illness to progress. We need to think about climate change in the same way we think about cancer - there isn't a safe level, which is why we need to take immediate action before it gets even worse. Another sobering parallel is that we can’t say with certainty at what point a cure will no longer be possible. There are incredibly complex inter-relationships in the natural world and potential for climate feedback loops to become established. This complexity means that it’s impossible to predict with any confidence when tipping points might occur that could leave us powerless to prevent further climate change. What we do know is that delay reduces the chances of a positive outcome and that it will mean that more extreme action is required. With a life threatening illness, very few of us would reject existing treatments and gamble on a better cure being developed in the near future. Yet this is what we risk by investing too much confidence in new technologies such as carbon removal. Carbon removal is currently unproven at anything like the scale required to have a real impact on climate change. It may indeed prove to be a solution in the future, but it’s completely irresponsible to bank on this. If we think of the climate and ecological emergency like a life threatening illness, then going with the best solutions currently available represents the most prudent way forward. We are creating solutions to address inaction on the climate and ecological emergency - not technical solutions to climate change and loss of biodiversity, as we already have those. Another reason XR isn’t advocating specific solutions is that our third demand is for the creation of citizens' assemblies. A citizens’ assembly involves a representative cross section of ordinary people learning about a subject and then coming up with recommendations on the way forward. Allowing normal people to determine our collective future offers a far better way forward than relying on politicians fearful of losing votes or a handful of billionaires to make all the difficult decisions. We believe that once people are given sufficient information and understand the options, they’ll be able to determine the best course of action. It isn’t appropriate for us to tell them what their answer should be before they get started. XR aims to increase awareness and understanding of the crisis, while also directly addressing the immoral lack of urgency to act. We want governments and the media to be completely open and honest about the full extent of the crisis we face, so that everyone understands its severity and the causes (Tell the Truth). This is so we can all push governments to take action at the speed the situation demands (Act Now). The solutions are all there and we want ordinary people (not just XR members) to make informed decisions on implementing them through citizens’ assemblies.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/03/09/XR-unchained-49/,"24 FEB | Indonesia The boy’s placard (right) reads ‘Your generation will die because of age, our generation will die because of the climate crisis.’ There’s always far more rebellion happening around the world than we can cover in one monthly newsletter. Unchained is a space to savour those beautiful and creative actions we couldn’t quite fit into the main issue. One of our favourites this month is the rebellion of the trees in the German city of Weimar. Perhaps trees around the world will start sending humans similar messages! 14 FEB | Germany More than 50 trees in Weimar carried arboreal messages: ‘We are screwed’ (left) and ‘At least, make climate protection important’. And trees - their destruction and planting - was the theme of actions in a number of other countries. 13 FEB | Rwanda XR Rwanda is rolling out a tree planting project to schools. They said: “Last year rebel David collected seeds for fast disappearing indigenous fruit trees and made a bed at home. Those who want seeds for pomegranates or guava trees can now contact us. Seeds are already packed. Seedlings are also available.” 27 FEB | France A group of rebels planted 200 trees beside a road in Dijon to draw the attention of the public authorities to the need to neutralise carbon emissions. 14 FEB | Czech Republic In the Czech town of Pardubice rebels demonstrated against the local municipality’s plans to cut down street trees. 12-21 FEB | Reunion Island, Indian Ocean On Reunion Island, a ‘department’ of France in the Indian Ocean, rebels and activists denounced the felling of trees in the Casabona forest, the ‘green lung’ park in the town of Saint Pierre. The town’s mayor said the trees had ‘no value’ and sent municipal police to protect the chainsaw crews. But after a call by Extinction Rebellion Réunion, 100 people gathered at the Casabona site and activists replanted trees where the chainsaws had passed two nights earlier. More than 31,500 people have signed a petition calling for a halt to the felling. 21 FEB | Australia Trees were also the concern of rebels protesting outside the headquarters of Simcoa, the Silicon Metal Company of Australia. In order to make silicon, Simcoa burns every year over 100,000 tonnes of old growth Jarrah, a type of eucalyptus. The timber comes from the south-west of Western Australia, an internationally recognised biodiversity hotspot. 5 MAR | Holland *‘*Burning trees on an industrial scale is bad for the climate, biodiversity and air quality. Palm tree biomass is NOT SUSTAINABLE. The construction of Vattenfall’s biomass plant at Diemen must stop immediately. That's why XR Netherlands is today blocking the entrance.’ 25 FEB - 2 MAR | Denmark 5 rebels were arrested and many more were fined for peacefully blocking construction on part of the Amager Common nature reserve close to central Copenhagen. It contains meadows, lakes, forests and a range of wildlife, including protected species. 4 MAR | Democratic Republic of Congo Rebels from XR University of Goma marched in the town to raise awareness of the evils of deforestation, climate injustice and the illicit exploitation of resources. 6 FEB | Belgium Belgian rebels called upon the city of Ghent to oppose the environmental permit for the expansion of the gas plant at Ghent Ringvaart, which could generate up to 350,000 tons of CO2 a year. 10 FEB | Australia Two brave rebels blocked a Riverside Expressway off-ramp in the heart of Brisbane. They erected a triangle of temporary fencing and attached themselves to it with bicycle locks around their necks. One rebel said she decided on civil disobedience to put ‘pressure on governments driving the climate and ecological emergency with the gas-led Covid recovery.’ 25-27 FEB | Poland Wroclaw Szczecin A coordinated wave of street blocking took place in a number of Polish cities, including Warsaw, Wroclaw, Bydgoszcz, Poznan and Szczecin. Several rebels were arrested. At the same time German rebels held a series of road blockades in the city of Dortmund. The Polish actions were kicked off by a courageous ‘rebellion of one’. In this astonishing video you can watch as the rebel blocks one lane of a busy main road in Wroclaw while cars speed past him in the other lane. Photo: Agencja Gazeta On 4 March, rebels in the city of Lodz followed up with their own examples of ‘rebellion of one’ - in spite of angry drivers and aggressive passers-by. ‘Yes,’ they said, ‘you can say that we disturbed the drivers or caused a traffic hazard. But we did it because NOBODY LISTENS. For years, scientists and governments have known that the climate crisis is a serious threat. For years, activists around the world have spoken, protested and petitioned in the hope that governments and corporations will finally make a difference.’ 28 FEB | Canada Three rebels were arrested after blocking an intersection in Vancouver. It took several hours for the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) to remove two rebels on tripods, using a chainsaw to dismantle the first tripod and a fire truck to reach the second. All three rebels were released quickly and the VPD did not resort to violence - in stark contrast to how they treat Indigenous land defenders. Photo: Kelly Tatham/Grace Grignon. 17 FEB | Indonesia A rebel banner drop demands that Indonesia declare a climate emergency. Boston, USA Hamburg, Germany 1 MAR | Finland Finnish rebels staged a number of actions in Helsinki to demand that Finland’s TV and other media tell the truth about the climate emergency. It included a spectacular ‘blood-soaked’ action in the Sanoma House in Finlandia Park. The banner reads ‘Silence Is Bloodshed - Tell The Truth’. The actions launched XR Finland’s Writing Crisis campaign, which will include demonstrations across Finland during the spring. 1 MAR | Israel Oil-drinking ocean rebels, together with symbolic ‘dead’ turtles, visited the Ministry of Energy in Tel Aviv to protest the devastating oil spill in February on the country’s Mediterranean coast. Photo: Yair Golan and Erez Harodi. 3 MAR | USA A coalition of groups gathered at the New York City headquarters of Black Rock investment firm and Chase Bank to demand that ‘these money monsters stop funding climate disaster’. Watch the oilheads puking on the earth. 1 MAR | UK A Barclays Bank branch in London becomes a Climate Crime Scene. Barclays is a major funder of oil, gas and coal projects around the world. 24 FEB | Holland ‘Stop Financing the Climate Crisis’. Rebels from XR Agriculture blocked the head offices of Rabobank in Utrecht. The multinational Dutch bank is a global leader in the financing of industrial farming. FEB | UK Posters like these appeared across the UK during February as part of an Extinction Rebellion initiative - TruthTeller.Life - to encourage sharing of insider information about the Climate and Ecological Crisis, and to give others the courage to do the same.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/03/09/global-newsletter-49/,"Animal Rebellion in Czech Republic gets caught in a web of lies. Dear rebels, Back in the summer of 2019, a small group of UK rebels felt something was missing from the exciting wave of climate activism that XR had ushered into the world. Our first International Rebellion had pushed the climate emergency into popular culture, and we were busy linking the climate crisis with other systems of human oppression - the crises of Capitalism, and Colonialism, and the Patriarchy. But one oppressive ideology was not being mentioned. Speciesism - the belief that one species of animal can be morally superior to and so dominate another. Animal Rebellion in front of the ministry of agriculture, Warsaw, Poland These rebels felt that speciesism was key to understanding how humanity dislocated itself from the natural world, how the climate crisis came about, and how to solve it. Quite simply, farming animals is one of the most ecologically destructive, oppressive and wasteful activities our civilisation does, and it is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. So they formed Animal Rebellion, a sister group to Extinction Rebellion, that retained our movement’s culture, tactics, and demands - but with one small addition. Their 2nd demand explicitly called for an end to the animal agriculture and fishing industries. Today Animal Rebellion chapters are active in over 30 countries, including Spain, Mexico, and Taiwan, and the movement is growing in every region of the world. They have targeted agri-conglomerates, blockaded meat subsidising parliaments, and campaigned for plant-based meals in schools - with actions involving international collaboration as well as campaigning side-by-side with XR. Animal Rebellion Taiwan march for climate and animal justice In Action Highlights you can see how the two movements formed a rebel alliance to launch the Spring Rebellion in the Netherlands, and learn more about Animal Rebellion’s vision for a plant-based society in Must Reads. Elsewhere in this issue we have a report on a global action targeting Norwegian embassies to highlight that government’s gratuitous greenwashing. We also cover a digital strike in the Philippines where rebels are fighting to stop a dam project that will devastate biodiversity. As yet another major report lands with the verdict that our governments are failing to address the climate emergency, we have to harness the power of as many rebels as possible to bring about the system change we all want, even if there are differences about how we get there. As Extinction Rebellion increasingly becomes a movement of movements, so too will this newsletter. We hope you enjoy the temporary shift in perspective that this Animal Rebellion themed issue brings.

Support the Rebellion 26 FEB - APR | Amsterdam, Netherlands Banner: ‘The Spring Rebellion is Here’ Photo: Robby Hiel XR Amsterdam and Animal Rebellion launched their first co-ordinated action to kick off the country’s Spring Rebellion. Rebels from both groups formed a moving blockade through the city, targeting a major road full of trams and traffic that led into its centre. Around 100 rebels were in attendance, with each movement bringing their own costumes, banners, and style. 3 XR rebels marched naked, each bearing an XR demands on their chest to ensure some messaging made it into the press. Animal Rebellion meanwhile had rebels dressed as bees and cows and chickens. But the Amsterdam police were ready and waiting at the first major crossing. They blocked off the procession and proclaimed that anyone who stayed put would be arrested. Around 2/3rds elected to ignore this warning and were carried by police into waiting buses, which then drove them to the outskirts of the city where they were dumped and told to walk home. Body-painted rebels make sure our 3 demands are seen by all. This pick up and dump tactic is a new and mutually beneficial arrangement for all parties. Images of rebels being arrested make it into the media, but the rebels don’t take up any cell space which is now severely limited thanks to covid restrictions. While protests of any size are legal in the Netherlands, social distancing still applies, and there is a strict 9pm curfew. The rebels who escaped the police buses proceeded to the Museumplein, a large public square, blocking streets with ‘mini-swarms’ along the way. After a few hours they were re-joined by their bussed off comrades, who had walked back into the city centre. But they did not remain united for very long. The rebel alliance meets a heavy police presence Photo: Isa Herzet As the parade headed for the National Opera house, a protest space prearranged with authorities, the police cornered them again, and another 40 rebels were loaded into the buses and deported to the suburbs. The Spring Rebellion will continue intermittently across Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Tilburg until April, with actions increasing in intensity around the national elections in mid-March. After a year of operating largely independently, both Animal Rebellion and XR Amsterdam are very happy with their blossoming alliance, and are already planning more detailed coordination for actions over the year ahead. 4 MARCH | Global Rebels around the world heard XR Norway’s call. They demonstrated outside Norwegian embassies in 26 cities across all 5 continents, while rebels in Oslo called in a crowd of hefty snowpeople to blockade their Justice Ministry. The global action was organised to condemn the Norwegian government’s climate hypocrisy as well as the state’s harsh response to domestic civil disobedience. The condemnation came from as far afield as Brazil, Canada, South Korea, and Uganda. Swedish rebels in Malmö even awarded the Norwegian government with the Nobel Prize of Hypocrisy in a special ceremony. South Korean rebels outside the Norwegian embassy in Seoul The Norwegian government officially plans to be carbon neutral by 2030, yet at the same time pumps out 2 million barrels of oil a day, coming 2nd only to Russia for the title of Europe's biggest oil producer. In Oslo there are smart street lamps powered by renewables that automatically dim when the streets are empty, yet these oil exports are not included in Norway’s territorial emissions. Last year, a new ""climate-friendly"" oil field was opened by the Prime Minister, who proudly claimed that the operation was powered by renewable energy and therefore “reducing emissions”. The state does not take kindly to XR Norway's attempts to point out its blatant hypocrisy. During a blockade of the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy last autumn, police arrested nearly all the rebels who had taken part, kept them in solitary confinement overnight, and then fined them 1 million Norwegian kroner, around 100,000 euros. While Norwegian rebels realise that their treatment by the state is still very privileged compared to authoritarian regimes elsewhere, the thorough police response and crippling fines are making civil disobedience very difficult in Norway. XR Norway is now running a fundraiser to help those 53 rebels fined for the Ministry protest last fall. Snowpeople block the exit of the Ministry of Justice but avoid fines Photo: XR Norway This is why snowpeople were employed for the Justice Ministry blockade in Oslo rather than humans. As one Norwegian rebel put it, “snowmen can’t be fined”. Weighing 50 to 60 kilos each, they also can’t be moved easily. Police examined them, but did not intervene while they were decorated with carrots, hats and placards to the soundtrack of the movie ‘Frozen’. Nobody was fined in the end. Though XR Norway wished there had been more media coverage of their own actions, they were grateful and very touched by all the international support they got. Nobel Prize of Hypocrisy ceremony in Malmö, Sweden 1 - 5 MARCH | Philippines XR Philippines has joined forces with the Stop Kaliwa Dam Network and Project 19 to raise awareness about the devastating effects of a proposed dam in the Sierra Madre mountains. Their campaign included social media posts, infographics, video testimonials, a ‘water for all’ webinar, and a petition. It concluded with a digital strike across Instagram, Facebook and Twitter by international youth groups. The Kaliwa Dam would destroy the habitat of 126 species across 300 hectares and expose 100,000 residents downstream to the risk of severe flooding. It also violates the Philippine Constitution as well as the rights and ancestral lands of 5,000 Dumagat-Remontados people who should be protected by the Indigenous People’s Rights Act (IPRA). Indigenous people protesting against the Kaliwa Dam project. Photo: Maria Tan The dam is only possible with a 210 million dollar loan from China, burdening the whole population with debt while only increasing the water supply for residents of the city of Manila. The terms of the loan allow China to settle disputes about the project using Chinese law. All this destruction for a dam with a lifespan of just 5 to 6 years due to the high rate of sedimentation in the area, and when better water solutions are available. It would be cheaper and more sustainable to repair and improve existing dams and water distribution facilities, adopt water conservation policies, or establish community-based forest management. The Kaliwa Dam project threatens many endemic species including the critically endangered Philippine eagle. Photo: Cornell Lab of Ornithology XR Philippines and other campaign partners will take their petition to the Philippine Climate Change Commission and Department of Environment and Natural Resources to highlight the fundamental flaws of the dam and build momentum for legal action. The indigenous groups involved face the challenge of staying safe in the pandemic while standing up against the dam. They also face serious danger from their own government, since the Philippine's Terrorism Law labels environmental defenders as terrorists. Rebels have been trying to help amplify the voices of local people who have both the most to lose and the best ideas to solve this water crisis. 24 FEB | NAMIBIA: Friday For Future - Windhoek and allies approach the National Assembly to hand a letter to their government demanding an immediate end to petroleum exploration in the Okavango Delta by ReconAfrica. 15 FEB | Petah Tikva, Israel Animal Rebellion activists protest at a logistics center of dairy giant Tnuva.

Animal Rebellion pops up again in Czech Republic. Who is Animal Rebellion? What is speciesism? Why is animal agriculture so terrible? How can farmers transition away from it and still make a good living? What would we do with all the empty fields? Should we all be vegan? The answers my rebels! The answers are all below! Medium: Who is Animal Rebellion? A short article about how Animal Rebellion started and what it’s like being a member. Medium: Now it is Time to Address Speciesism An article about how speciesism (the treatment of one species as morally superior to another) is key to understanding how the climate crisis happened and why Animal Rebellion is needed. Youtube: George Monbiot’s Smithfield Speech (26 mins) A brilliant speech by the British journalist and writer during Animal Rebellion’s blockade of a London meat market. Monbiot chronicles his gradual realisation that no matter how you tweak it, animal agriculture destroys ecosystems and has to be stopped. Vimeo: 73 Cows (dir. Alex Lockwood, 15 mins) A moving short documentary about an English beef farmer who transitioned his farm to sustainable, organic, plant-based agriculture. Harvard Law School: Repurposing UK Agricultural Land to Meet Climate Goals A study showing how if land used for animal farming was turned back into native forest, the UK could align its emissions with commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Novara Media: Should We All Be Vegan? An interview with Peter Singer, professor of Bioethics at Princeton University and author of Animal Liberation - a foundation text of the animal liberation movement. Recipe Corner: Animal Rebellion focuses on system change, not personal change, so doesn’t ask its members to be vegan. But with the understanding that plant-based meals can be damn delicious, why not check out these recipes that our newsletter team keep coming back to… Sudanese Jewish Peanut Sauce (Use hot water not stock. Have it on roast veg or in a stir fry.)Turtle’s Original Recipes (inc. Toasted Tofu Sandwich & Breakfast Apple Pie!)Best Vegan Lasagne (I tweaked this a bit & prefer brown over red lentils, & pre-baked aubergine slices over zucchini - but however you do it this is delicious.)Vegan Banana Bread (So easy so good. The website is a treasure trove of vegan cake recipes.) This may seem an odd choice, since it’s not focused on climate, but for this month’s theme of Animal Rebellion, it’s perfect. The book poses a seemingly simple question: “what should we eat?” The answer is wrapped up in culture, economics, ethics, land management, environmental conservation, and, yes, human survival. Pollan explores all these through four meals representing, respectively, industrial agriculture; two very different forms of free-range alternative agriculture; and hunting and gathering. He buys a steer, slaughters a chicken, briefly becomes vegetarian, and goes hunting for wild boar. Although Pollan does issue some advice, his book is less a prescriptive argument and more an engaging and informative work of first-person journalism. Here are a few other books recommended by us and our readers... Animal Liberation, by Peter Singer Peter Singer is one of the world’s leading moral philosophers and this very readable book, published in 1975, is widely regarded as the founding philosophical statement about speciesism and the treatment of animals by humans, including in animal agriculture and animal experiments. My Year of Meats, by Ruth Ozeki By turns hilarious and horrifying, this brilliant and satirical novel skewers the US beef industry from a cross-cultural Japanese-American perspective, complete with television and factory farming, love, fertility and motherhood. The Tale of the Whale, by Karen Swann A lovely, lyrical children’s book about a friendship between a child and a whale as they learn about the dangers of plastic pollution. Watch out—multiple books share this title, so check the author’s name. Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England, by William Cronon Continuing our focus on animal agriculture, Cronon’s book merges history and ecology to describe the shift between one form of land management and another. An excellent case study of the deeply-entrenched cultural, economic, and political realities we continue to struggle against today. Skyseed, by Bill McGuire OK, this one has little to do with animals—it’s a cautionary novel about geoengineering—but out of everybody who wrote in recommending books this month, almost half of you recommended this one. “As (possibly well-meaning) leaders everywhere grasp for ‘fixes’ in preference to fundamental behaviour/system change, XR readers might be usefully reminded of the dangerous consequences of ‘geoengineering’” (David) Avoid Amazon.

Anatoly’s sign: ‘We come in Peace’ Photo: Lior Klein Over a year ago, it seems like ages now, friends mentioned to me a meeting related to climate and extinction, and some movement whose name I hadn't heard before. Being curious, I found myself there, introduced to XR. The urgency of the situation was shocking, but so clear. Our planet is dying, and we're responsible. We must act. I must act. And the ideas of decentralization and Nonviolent Direct Action (NVDA) got me instantly inspired. I'd love to live much closer to nature, in a little community, and not have to worry about anything else. But I find that I can't just ignore the climate and how we humans are destroying it. I can't sleep well knowing our dear planet, our only home, is burning, and I'm not doing much to save her. So, here I am. In Action and Logistics, in my local/regional affinity group, in Animal Rebellion too... because we're just one animal among many. But my favorite is Regenerative Culture work. Promoting a deep peaceful meaningful enriching connection with ourselves, with each other, and with mother nature. This sort of well-being/caring work is my passion outside of XR too, so it seems to fit well. And If we had that in the first place, this whole climate catastrophe wouldn't happen... radically changing our culture is the only way to make sure it doesn't happen again. NVDA is so empowering! I get to stand up for myself and for the planet. Through my mere presence, to encourage people (hopefully including the decision makers) to search for that softness within their hearts, towards the whole wealth of life, and make those political and financial and organizational decisions that must be made in order to save us. But NVDA can also be stressful, scary, exhausting. I couldn't do it without the loving support of friends and fellow rebels. Without time dedicated to celebration, relaxation, singing, soul-searching, gratitude. A month ago we had an action, the biggest and most daring we've done. So I spent the day before, with much precious help from my friends, making a vegan meal for 40 people, to eat between the training and the action. I hadn't cooked in a long time, especially not for other people, so this was very fun and exciting! The next day, after the training, I went to where the food was waiting. Fellow rebels had already heated all the food and put it in pots and bowls, and everyone was eating and talking and buzzing. That chance, to give with love, was so precious to me. In those stressful moments before the action, seeing everyone enjoy that meal, was so, so sweet.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/03/04/regenerative-agriculture-feed-world/,"© Pexels Skitterphoto Regenerative agriculture. It’s not a phrase that’s easy to spell or pronounce, is it? Nevertheless, it’s a phrase that is set to become increasingly familiar. Why? Because life depends on it. Our current intensive agriculture methods are unsustainable; they destroy ecosystems and diminish biodiversity. Regenerative agriculture heals this damage and strengthens food security. Just like over half of the world, I have lived my life separated from agriculture in urban environments. What do I really know about how my food arrives on my plate? Food packaging and advertising show me happy images of green patchwork landscapes and colourful farming machines ploughing golden fields of lined-up crops. Roughly one-third of the world’s food is wasted every year, which, too, seems to suggest that food is plentiful. There’s no doubt that industrial agriculture has produced fantastic amounts of food for decades, with each technical innovation introducing another way to reduce human effort while increasing production: tractors replaced horses, and then combine harvesters replaced tractors. We identified nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as the elements of plant growth, then created synthetic fertilisers from them. We also discovered herbicides and pesticides, with which farmers could kill weeds and destructive insects by simply spraying them. The industrialisation of farming was a shining example of human ingenuity. So, what’s the problem? The problem is that our short-term farming solutions are cooking up long-term disasters. © Pexels & Tom Fisk Our intensive farming practices have covered Earth in monocultures: fields dedicated to growing only one plant. After all, if you make more money from growing corn, why would you plant anything else? It’s logical from an economic perspective to intensify farming until all obstacles to the final crop are removed, such as weeds, or hungry insects. In business, greater efficiency equals greater profits, so of course we have intensified our agriculture. Unfortunately, monocultures decrease the number of natural interactions between different living organisms, because most of them have been removed, or killed with chemicals, for the sake of the crop. In other words, monocultures reduce biodiversity. In the 2020 David Attenborough documentary Extinction: The Facts, soil ecologist Richard Bardgett explains: ‘Soil should be teeming with life. One of the most important things that animals in the soil do is to break down organic matter, which is used for plant growth.’ Monoculture farming crushes these ecological relationships. We often engage with natural processes as problems to be fixed: we dig up and turn soil before sowing seeds, which degrades the soil and releases greenhouse gases that would naturally stay underground; we clear unwanted plants after harvesting, which exposes bare earth to harsh weather and erosion. Then, as degraded soil cannot retain as much water as healthy soils, we experience unnecessary droughts. Intensive agriculture is at war with nature. What happens when you suppress your natural instincts for the sake of productivity? For example, if I worked in an office for 12 hours every day, didn’t go outside for a break, nor even made time to stop and eat a healthy lunch, I would probably get more work done. But in the long-term, I’d also become stressed, unhealthy and miserable. This is what intensive agriculture is doing to soil. As you’ve probably realised, this is bad news. During a World Soil Day 2014 event in Rome, Dutch activist Volkert Engelsman, an Organic Ambassador for IFOAM Organics International, said ‘we are losing 30 soccer fields of soil every minute, mostly due to intensive farming.’ In Extinction: The Facts, Robert Watson (then the Chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) says, ‘food production in some parts of the world is going down, due to soil degradation and a changing climate’. The upper layer of soil in which plants grow is called topsoil. The speed at which topsoil builds in the natural world depends on numerous factors, such as topography and climate, but it appears to take approximately 500 years to grow one inch of topsoil. Remember this — I’ll come back to it later. If we continue with our current, widespread intensive agriculture practices, we will increasingly endanger our food supplies. © Pexels & Taryn Elliott Farmers who use regenerative farming methods cooperate with nature. They grow plants using methods that revive ecosystems. These methods are complex and various, because each is unique to the ecosystem, soil characteristics and climate of a farm. Some common regenerative agriculture principles, however, include: Create permacultures Carefully manage animal grazing Go organic Grow ‘cover’ crops Compost Reduce or eliminate tillage Was all that information a bit overwhelming? I’m a lifelong city boy with no agricultural experience, so I know how you feel. I recently lived on a small farm called Witchwood, however, which is a great example of regenerative agriculture in action. © Jill Redwood Witchwood farm (above) is a 22-acre farm in the small valley community of Goongerah, 340km east of Melbourne, Australia. Witchwood is owned by Jill Redwood, who also fights to protect the area’s high biodiversity with Environment East Gippsland. When Jill bought the land in 1983 it was a bare, lifeless field. She gradually added trees, gardens, and fences, creating an organic farm with chickens, geese, goats, and horses. Jill lives as sustainably as possible, which has influenced Witchwood’s design. Don’t use chemicals Don’t overgraze Don’t export manure I arrived on Jill’s beautiful farm after Melbourne’s long 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. Jill has worked hard to create an environment of thriving ecosystems and organic ingredients, but her journey was quite simple. ‘When I got here, the degraded soil was hard and I didn’t find many worms’ explains Jill. ‘That was the first thing to fix, so I planted loads of native and European trees — they’re both useful. It felt obvious to use natural methods, which seemed to work well. Nature can do the job of chemicals, sprays and artificial fertilisers, if you give her a chance.’ Brown’s Ranch is a 5,000-acre farm in the USA. During the mid-1990s, owners Gabe and Shelly Brown suffered four years of weather-related crop failure and began experimenting with no-till farming, to retain soil moisture and reduce fuel costs. Next, the farm stopped using man-made fertilisers, fungicides, and pesticides and started growing a wider variety of crops. The movement of cattle between pastures was also changed, so that each pasture is left empty after grazing to regenerate for at least 360 days. As a result, Brown’s Ranch is now a successful business that sells ‘cash crops’, such as corn and wheat, as well as grass-fed beef, pork, lamb and chicken, honey, vegetables and fruit. Gabe Brown is building North America’s regenerative agriculture movement with Understanding Ag and he claims that the farm’s regeneration has produced ‘several inches’ of topsoil in 20 years. © Pexels & Kaboompics.com I have experienced the many benefits of regenerative agriculture for myself, but I fear it might be less efficient than intensive agriculture: it’s no coincidence that population numbers exploded alongside the rise of intensive agriculture. Can we really feed this many humans — and more — without fertilisers, herbicides or monocultures? One of the largest-ever scientific analyses of regenerative agriculture attempted to answer this question in November 2020. The American journal Science Advances analysed 41,946 comparisons between ‘diversified’ (regenerative) and ‘simplified’ (intensive) agriculture practices. Its results are in the title: Agricultural diversification promotes multiple ecosystem services without compromising yield. The brains at Science Advances concluded that, overall, farmers do not experience a reduction in crop yields when they adopt regenerative agriculture practices. The study also underlines that every farm requires its own balanced combination of these practises in order to achieve the best results, which is one of the biggest challenges facing farmers who wish to switch. Crop yields should not be the sole criterion by which we judge the viability of regenerative agriculture, especially not its economic viability. More crops do not automatically result in more money for farmers. In the case of Brown’s Ranch, Gabe Brown claims that after years of financial strife the ranch now generates 100 USD profit per acre, per year. ‘If you build a healthy farm ecosystem, you’re going to be resilient’, says Gabe. In 2017, Project Drawdown released Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming. The book assesses and ranks every global heating solution available. If implemented together, these solutions would cause global greenhouse gas emissions to peak, then decline — ‘drawdown’. Editor Paul Hawken and a team of nearly 70 researchers compiled the book, then an advisory board of 120 people including climatologists, biologists, economists, and financial analysts validated the facts. Drawdown concludes that ‘regenerative agriculture could provide a 1.9 trillion USD financial return by 2050 [globally], on an investment of 57 billion USD.’ © Pexels Pixabay 1.9 trillion USD is a very large pie, so it’s unsurprising that massive food companies want a slice. General Mills plans to bring regenerative agriculture to one million acres of land by 2030. If General Mills sounds familiar, it’s probably because this huge company is behind brands including Cheerios, Häagen-Dazs, Wanchai Ferry, Yoplait, and Betty Crocker. The North American company is promoting many of the ideas I have covered, with its ‘six core principles’. These principles are very similar to those used at Witchwood and Brown’s Ranch, such as minimal soil disturbance, the need to keep soil covered, and the integration of livestock. General Mills is also investing in research, such as a long-term study of cover-crop benefits at the University of Manitoba. General Mills’ plans suggest that sustainable farming practices are spreading, but is this a global trend? Project Drawdown attempted to answer this mighty difficult question in 2017, estimating that the amount of land on which regenerative agriculture is practised would increase from 108 million acres to one billion by 2050 (for context, in 2016 it was estimated that 12 billion acres, or 4.87 billion hectares, were dedicated to agricultural purposes worldwide). Project Drawdown’s (conservative) estimate was based on the speed with which organic farming has been embraced globally, combined with the expectation that farmers currently incorporating one or two regenerative agriculture practises will eventually abandon all degenerative practises (as Gabe Brown did at Brown’s Ranch). Furthermore, Project Drawdown predicts that 424 million acres of abandoned, degraded farmland could be restored using regenerative agriculture by 2050. Trying to judge regenerative agriculture’s global potential is a colossal task, but its economics, crop yield and scalability all show promise. Agriculture, however, is just one part of our global food system, in which many improvements must be made. The World Resources Institute highlighted this in its 2018 report, Creating a Sustainable Food Future. As well as stating the importance of many regenerative agriculture principles, the report concluded that reductions in food waste, a shift to sustainable diets, the restoration of peatlands, and improved wild fishery management were all vital to securing a sustainable food future. © Pexels Pixabay The global food system is complex enough to make your brain explode, but two hard facts are at its core: without healthy soil, food struggles to grow; without food, humans cannot exist. Our overwhelmingly widespread intensive farming methods are threatening soil health across the world. The Soil Science Society of America says one inch of topsoil can take several hundred years or more to develop. Regenerative agriculture defies such limitations: Gabe Brown produced several inches in 20 years; Jill Redwood told me she has found forgotten gardening tools at Witchwood ‘covered by five or six inches of soil.’ We are not destined to fail. Regenerative agriculture is further proof that if humanity works with nature, instead of against it, we can build a healthier and brighter world. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/03/01/climate-action-in-global-solidarity/,"Esteban Servat is an Argentinian scientist who worked in Silicon Valley before returning to the Mendoza province where he created a self-sustaining community. Before his arrival, the local community had successfully fought against mega-mining projects from western multinationals including Coro Mining and Barrick Gold. Ten years later, the government of Argentina began sponsoring fracking projects - again for the profit of western multinationals like BP or Total. These projects destroy Patagonia’s landscapes and threaten the health livelihoods of its inhabitants by contaminating precious water sources. Children in areas with fracking wells are dying of leukemia at a rate three times higher than the national average. In the face of this threat, Esteban became an activist to stop the projects. He was forced into exile to Berlin in 2019 after countless attempts at psychological and physical intimidation. This is his story. As Esteban dug deeper into the fracking project process, he uncovered a document that revealed the process’ huge environmental impact. The government was attempting to bury the evidence and replace the study results with fakes to make sure the local population would not take action and fight against the fracking wells. Having discovered the incriminating document, Esteban and other activists decided to create Ecoleaks, a website that would host leaked confidential documents exposing environmental scandals. They then released the document to the public. Local residents were outraged and organised into the largest anti-fracking movement in Argentina’s history. This also caused the government to pay close attention to Esteban’s activism. The government brought trumped-up criminal cases against Esteban and fellow activists in an attempt to bully them into silence. Following a mounting campaign of violence against him and his family, including death threats, Esteban went into exile to Berlin, Germany. Once in Europe, he focused on the responsibility of western countries in the disaster his community in Argentina was fighting against. Enter climate colonialism and global solidarity. Esteban uses the example of fracking to show how European countries are playing a direct role in the destruction of the environment and the people of front-line communities across the globe. Big oil companies like BP, Total and Shell are actively engaged and even subsidised by European governments to acquire huge amounts of land in Argentina to frack for oil when fracking isn’t allowed by those same governments in their home country. This is a direct continuation of colonial systems of oppression and extraction of resources. Western countries do not apply the same standards to their projects in other countries as they do in their own backyard. This allows them to extract cheaply and enrich themselves at the expense of front-line communities that suffer the consequences of these practises. What can Western-based activists do to support front-line struggles in solidarity? There is a direct link between front-line struggles like the fracking protests in Mendoza and Western countries. Companies based or owned by Western countries are the ones doing the damage with the support of their governments. There are actions that western activists can take at a much lesser cost than front-line communities because they are closer to the headquarters of those perpetuating colonial systems and less at risk of persecution for their activism. European activists for example must organise to force multinational companies to stop climate colonialism. They must get in touch with front-line communities that are protesting destructive extraction processes like fracking and support them by bringing the protest to the companies’ and complicit governments’ doorsteps. And we know this kind of global solidarity works. Have a look at this inspiring video from the Shale Must Fall campaign in Ireland.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/02/18/guide-to-ccs/,"With thanks to Professor Paul Fennell. Whether you’re for it or against it, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is something worth talking about. Carbon dioxide - CO₂ - is a greenhouse gas; after release, it builds up in our atmosphere, trapping heat and causing temperatures to rise. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technique which can be used to stop the release of CO₂ into the atmosphere during certain industrial processes. If this is a completely new concept to you - don’t worry, you’re not alone. It is discussed by academics, engineers and some politicians, but is not marketed enough to be known by the majority of the general public. That’s a problem. These ideas shouldn’t be limited to the experts: they should form part of everyone’s vocabulary. This article exists for you to make up your own mind about CCS. It is not designed to support or condemn CCS. This is an article which puts technology at its heart. I am an engineer. I want you to walk away from this article knowing that carbon dioxide can be captured and it can be stored. The truth is… I have spent four years of my life trying to understand the technology and the debate surrounding it. We only have ten minutes. You will not be an expert by the end of this article, but you will know enough about the basics to understand the complexities of this subject. Let's dive into the details together. Here is a very simple explanation of how CCS works: Imagine a coal-fired power plant: the coal burns, releasing heat and gases. The heat is useful, producing electricity. The waste gases, mostly carbon dioxide and water vapour, must then be removed. The cheapest and most common option is to build a chimney - known as a 'stack' - to allow these gases to leave the plant. What if you could separate those waste gases from the CO₂, keeping it away from atmosphere? That is carbon capture. What if you take that separated CO₂and pump it underground? That is carbon capture and storage, or carbon capture and sequestration. Both terms are interchangeable, used in industry, and are often shortened to the acronym 'CCS'. There are three types of commonly-discussed capture types: pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxyfuel combustion. Pre-combustion capture works by exposing fossil fuels to high pressure steam. Think back to our coal power plant: grinders crush up the coal, ready for reaction. Then, rather than burn it in air, the pipes pump out high-pressure steam instead. If we look at the chemistry for a moment, air contains oxygen (O₂) whereas steam is water (H₂O); oxygen (‘O’) is the key ingredient for burning fuel. Notice that oxygen has 2 Os and water has just one? Well, think of air ‘fully’ burning the coal, and steam ‘semi-burning’ it. When we semi-burn with water, we produce different products - carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The CO₂ can be easily separated from the hydrogen. Pipes carry away the CO₂ for sequestration, and the hydrogen burns in a furnace, releasing energy for either heat or power. This is the key benefit of pre-combustion capture: it can support the transition to hydrogen-based power. Post-combustion capture is easier to visualise - in fact, it works like a vape. Back to the coal power plant. This time, the target is after combustion. The fossil fuel burns in air, producing the waste gases carbon dioxide and water vapour. Rather than venting through a stack, the waste gases travel to a ‘separation station’. The aim is to separate the gases once again. However, this is a different mixture of gases to pre-combustion: nitrogen from the air, carbon dioxide and water. These waste gases bubble through a special pool of liquid (known as a ‘solvent’). The CO₂ ‘likes’ the pool, clinging onto the liquid and staying in solution. The other gases are not as keen, passing through the mixture easily and to the top of the vessel. CO₂ clings less when heaters warm up the pool, releasing the gas and allowing sequestration. Post-combustion capture is useful for existing plants, as the capture technology is relatively easy to add to existing infrastructure, and works at the end of the process. Oxyfuel combustion is the newest capture technology and is yet to be used in industry. It works in a similar way to post-combustion capture, except that the fossil fuel burns in pure oxygen rather than air. [1] Why burn fuel in pure oxygen? It is a more efficient way to produce CO₂, as well as reducing the production of common pollutants. There is so much CO₂ that once all the water vapour is removed, it can be pumped away immediately. Pumps compress the purified carbon dioxide to high pressures, transferring it from the plant to the storage site, before pressurising it to such high levels that it acts like both a liquid and gas (known as ‘supercriticality’). As it has properties of both liquid and gas, scientists call it a ‘fluid’. It is injected underground in this fluid state using a wellhead, where it remains trapped. (The technology is virtually identical to oil and gas drilling). However, CO₂ cannot just be injected anywhere underground. There needs to be enough capacity to store large amounts safely and for a long period of time. This means there are specific types of geological sites used to store carbon dioxide: Deep saline aquifers: layers of rock storing saltwater deep underground Old oil and gas fields: where oil and gas were trapped millions of years ago. Source: Tsar et al. 2013 The CO₂ initially remains trapped due to a layer of rock which sits above the fluid, stopping it from moving upwards towards the atmosphere. As time goes on, the CO₂ mixes with saltwater, dissolves, and eventually reacts with it to form rock. These processes can take millions, even billions, of years to occur. Carbon capture and storage can be used in any industry which produces carbon dioxide. At the moment, the major industry is natural gas processing. Natural gas contains methane - the flammable fuel burned in our boilers - and CO₂. Rather than transport all the CO₂ to the consumer, it is easier to separate it at source. Carbon capture can also be applied to several other industries: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that CCS is a key asset in helping to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Carbon dioxide emissions will not be lowered enough by simply decreasing fossil fuel consumption alone. While the world transitions to low-carbon power, CCS allows us to capture carbon dioxide at source, ensuring it cannot reach the atmosphere and greatly reducing its harmful effects. The effectiveness of CCS is clear when examining a real-life example: Boundary Dam in Canada, which is a CCS plant attached to a coal power plant. The plant was designed to take in one million tonnes of CO₂ each year, and this month it captured CO₂ at a rate equivalent to 900,000 tonnes per year. Using figures published online, I was able to calculate that Boundary Dam would have released 59,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions this month without CCS capabilities. However, with the help of carbon capture, this figure was reduced to 7,000 tonnes. In other words, 52,000 tonnes of CO₂ ‘avoided’ release into the atmosphere [2]. That is a lot of carbon dioxide which will not need to be dealt with further down the line, when its harmful effects are a lot harder to avoid. Importantly, it is not only in the energy sector that emissions can be reduced through CCS. Perhaps the most useful aspect of CCS is that it can be applied to industries which cannot, at present, be decarbonised: notably, cement and steel. Steel is made by heating iron oxide with carbon, and carbon dioxide is the waste product. Concrete and cement are central to our everyday lives, but their production releases CO₂ without any burning of fossil fuels. CCS allows the production of these fundamental materials - used in housing, dams (both hydroelectric and reservoirs), bridges, wind farm construction, and other large civil infrastructure projects-while greatly reducing their emissions rate. CCS not only exists, but the number of sites is growing year on year. There are currently nineteen sites in operation, with thirty more under construction, proposed or waiting for approval. Major universities such as Imperial College London and MIT, and oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are pushing forward development. Yes, Big Oil is interested...but more on that later. CCS does offer some advantages. Fewer CO₂ emissions go into the atmosphere, reducing the impact of burning fossil fuels which, as we know, leads to global warming. Plus, it can do this incredibly efficiently when designed and put in place properly. However, it would be wrong not to question CCS at all. Let’s run through some disadvantages of CCS technology, before you make up your mind. Source: IPCC, Synthesis Report AR5, Fig 1.7 CCS is limited because it can’t be applied to all CO₂ emissions. For example, forest fires and agricultural practices make up 25% of emissions. CCS cannot be applied here because combustion is unplanned. CCS is also difficult to apply to the transport sector. Let’s take the automotive industry: there are approximately 1 billion cars worldwide, each releasing carbon dioxide. In order to store this carbon dioxide on the individual level, each vehicle would require its own collection and storage unit. The carbon dioxide will accumulate, making the car heavier, meaning you need more fuel, meaning you produce more carbon dioxide. Plus, even if you were to make these changes to individual vehicles, then what? Everyone would have to have a carbon dioxide pipe in their homes; there would also have to be local and central hubs to dispose of this personal CO₂ collection, and so on... In other words, it is far easier to capture carbon with a small number of large producers than with a large number of small producers. (As a side note, this is another way in which electric cars help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Factories can easily capture the carbon dioxide when oil is burned in a power plant to produce electricity. It is practically impossible to capture tiny amounts of carbon dioxide when petrol is burned in your car.) CCS is not a moneymaker. Not only that, it requires massive up-front investment for relatively little return. Companies typically do not implement CCS because they have little incentive to do so. There is a world where CCS can exist, but it relies heavily on the world having a carbon tax. If countries and companies have to pay to release CO₂, they will seek out ways to stop releasing it into the atmosphere. Some countries already have carbon taxes, and these are the countries in which CCS is being implemented - Norway being the primary example. However, it is also likely that these projects involve something called ‘Enhanced Oil Recovery’ (see below), as oil (usually) produces profit. Also, there are issues with construction. Carbon dioxide needs to be transported somehow, and building the additional infrastructure to do this takes years. This could reduce its effectiveness, depending on how quickly we can move towards a future of low-carbon power. However, it is possible and some regions, such as Teesside in the UK and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, are planning to have completed construction within the next five years. Back to Big Oil: they have a vested interest in CCS, due to something known as ‘Enhanced Oil Recovery’ (EOR). They can use carbon dioxide from pre-combustion capture, compress it, inject it again and force out more oil from an oil well. Companies can produce more oil per well, making wells more profitable. This increases the number of wells which are considered profitable for the company to exploit, therefore more oil will be produced and we continue the cycle of oil dependence. It is important to note: there are still carbon emissions from EOR. EOR allows oil companies to harvest more oil profitably over a longer period of time, meaning more carbon dioxide could be released than if oil companies are limited by their current oil production. In other words, it may be more effective to kill fossil fuels quickly than let it die slowly. However, there is some balance to this argument. Significantly more carbon dioxide is stored through EOR than is released by burning the crude oil that comes out. It is a much better option than crude oil production without EOR - providing that total oil demand decreases with time. Furthermore, EOR means companies want to fund carbon capture research and development which benefits everyone in the long run, and the implementation of EOR has also proven the safety of CCS on a large scale. And while EOR currently generates the most profit for oil companies, if economies change, so will their approaches to carbon capture. In other words, they may choose to progress from EOR to ‘regular’ carbon capture and storage… with the introduction of subsidies or technological innovation. This being said, there are sound arguments against this continued reliance on fossil fuels in a rapidly heating world. CCS succeeds in decarbonisation models partly because it is the smallest possible change from the current infrastructure. There are other options for energy decarbonisation. However, it is ‘more secure’ to keep infrastructure as it is, and this desire is driven by everyone, whether they be politicians or members of the public. The money that could be spent on these other options is put towards fossil fuel industries. $150 billion was spent by global governments subsidising oil in 2019 alone. Installing such complex energy decarbonisation systems may currently have high political and financial barriers to overcome, but countries will lose more money if they don’t change tactics as soon as possible. Even ignoring the impact of climate change on national economies, there is still an economic case for renewable energy. The price of renewable energy is similar to fossil fuels (with some conditions), and CCS will actually make fossil fuels less competitive. Should companies really be investing in expensive ways of reducing carbon emissions, when they could be investing in available green technologies and eliminate them completely? There are some environmental risks associated with the storage of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is typically stored under oceanic rock. If the rock is placed under too much pressure, it may fracture, or earthquakes may cause rock layers to shift, leading to carbon dioxide leaks. If carbon dioxide leaks into the oceans it causes ocean acidification - a process which is already happening at alarming rates - and destroys marine ecosystems with devastating effects. It is important to note that no sites have leaked in the short-term at present. In fact, one CCS site was shut down rather than risk putting the rock under too much pressure. Right, that was a lot of information. Let it all sink in. This view covers a range of opinions. Maybe CCS should be applied to every single industry it possibly can. Maybe it should be applied to essential industries that cannot otherwise be decarbonised. Maybe the lure of an entry route into hydrogen is too much to resist, and it is a good transition to a cleaner world. If this is your view, the million-dollar question is: why aren’t all capable countries implementing CCS? In short, it comes down to an individual government's priorities. Ten countries have chosen to implement CCS. Hundreds have not. Since CCS is an idea usually left to academics or engineers, there may not be enough public opinion on CCS to make it a priority in some countries. This should change, and is why CCS needs to be discussed by citizens in Citizens’ Assemblies. Fair enough. Sometimes, governments need to take large strides to action rather than walking on their tiptoes. CCS is the equivalent of a half-step. There are different ways to implement decarbonisation - some of which I hope to discuss in future articles. Again, there is no clear answer. These alternatives should also be part of the discussions by citizens within their Assemblies. I would be surprised if ten minutes would convince you to feel strongly either way. Governments have not figured out their stances after several years! To pick just two examples, the Netherlands has flip-flopped on the issue, while the UK government has been indecisive, leading to estimated billion-pound losses. The truth is that global governments are currently unlikely to spend large amounts of money on projects which have little public interest and aren’t economically profitable in the short-term. If, however, public opinion were to change, there is potential for CCS to be pursued more openly. Regardless of your take on the CCS debate, carbon capture and storage should at the very least be part of the discussion. It should form one of many urgent discussion topics for citizens’ assemblies: Extinction Rebellion’s third and final demand. Sign up to the Rebellion here!

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/02/10/climate-refugees-justice/,"The sea water is rising every day …we lost everything. We are not happy, because we must move again. Climate change is making thousands of people homeless — Nurul Hashem (Bangladeshi school teacher) Our ancestors were hunters and gatherers—we began as a nomadic society that moved from place to place in search of food and shelter. Then we found the Fertile Crescent—spanning modern day Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq—which was so bountiful that our needs were met in spades and we settled down in one spot. Food and security were plentiful. We began building settlements, marking the beginning of the non-nomadic societies many of us inhabit today. Fast forward about 11,000 years. The once fertile area has become rife with war, environmental degradation, and displacement. And it’s not alone. More than ever before, people around the world are fleeing their homes, with a total of 79.5 million people forcibly displaced by the end of 2019. Historically, displaced people were seen as refugees because their displacement was usually the result of violent conflict or persecution. But in recent years, many refugees cite the changing climate as one of the reasons they have fled their homes. Scientists are also investigating the role that climate breakdown plays in displacing people from their homes. The environmental question has become so prominent that it has given rise to a new term—‘climate refugees’. Fishermen in Burkina Faso abandon their boats on a dried up lake during the dry season near Ouagadougou. Photo by Yoda Adaman While there is no legal definition for it, the term ‘climate refugees’ has recently entered our vocabulary. It describes people who have fled their homes because of changes in the environment. It describes anyone from people whose homes are swallowed by the sea after a hurricane to those whose homes are burnt down by wildfires to people who migrate from their homes to new areas because slow-onset climate change has devastated their livelihood. The Delta fire in California, Wikipedia I had a moment where I thought, would it be fast if we died? Would my kids suffer? Would they die from the smoke, or would they die from the fire? — Michelle Teixeira, California At the international level, there is disagreement on the terminology. Some argue that people displaced by climatic events do not meet the legal definition of 'refugees'. They say there is no ‘persecution’. People displaced by climate breakdown often migrate within their own country, making them internally displaced people (IDPs) and not refugees. Others point to the difficulty in teasing out the changing climate’s role in displacement, when there are often many factors at play. But others insist that using the word ‘refugees’ emphasizes the urgency of their situation. It also infuses it with demands for justice. It is in this spirit of urgency, political responsibility, and justice that I will use the term ‘climate refugees’ in this article to describe people whose displacement was strongly impacted by climate breakdown. Bangladeshi climate refugees, Photo by Sabbir What climate refugees around the world have in common is that climate breakdown has made their homes uninhabitable, forcing them to leave. Yet not all effects of climate breakdown are quickly or easily seen. Often it can be difficult to untangle the intricate web of factors contributing to displacement. Behind the scenes, climate breakdown may interplay with conflict and war. But this is often overshadowed by sexier headlines of ethnic, national, or regional violence. Similarly, the connections between climate breakdown, hunger, and financial insecurity often aren't clearly presented. The layered factors forcing displacement remain clouded by competing elements. For example, Somalia is often presented as a ‘failed state’— rife with famine and militias. Drought is mentioned, but often without exploring its effects beyond poverty and or aid dependence. Climate breakdown is devastating Somalia, despite having some of the lowest carbon emissions in the world. Reporting for The GroundTruth Project, Laura Heaton tells us how drought can impact violence and how this combination displaced Khalid, a young Somali man, from his home— making him a climate refugee. Humanitarian map of Somalia, showing decreased rainfall and displacement across Somalia, Wikipedia Khalid used to have good harvests from his mango trees, but in recent years the crops began to fail. His income dropped and he had less to eat. Al Shabab, a militant group, preyed upon the vulnerability that comes with hunger and lost income. They imposed a 'tax' on Khalid's harvest, taking one third for themselves. Knowing that if he joined the group he would finally have enough to eat and the 'tax' would be dropped, Khalid eventually gave in. Al Shabab had also taken advantage of the poverty in Somalia by banning international aid organizations— keeping people in poverty and making them reliant upon the militant group. Khalid was a member of the group for two years before ditching an assigned mission and walking to Kenya. At the time of the interview he was living in a refugee camp there. Somalia’s drought had created a life of poverty for Khalid, which reduced his life options. Knowing this, members of the militant group coerced him into eventually joining them as a means of survival. He probably repeated the extortion he had faced and participated in other oppressive activities—perpetuating both poverty and violence. He joined al Shabab not out of ideology, but hunger. Ultimately, these factors forced him to leave Somalia and seek refuge in Kenya. It is this nexus of events and experiences that make the impacts of climate change harder to see. We are used to understanding refugees as the result of one clear cut event—the bombing of a village, persecution, an earthquake. This narrow view, however, risks overlooking the critical role that slow-onset climate breakdown plays in creating—or strengthening—other threats. It is often the amalgamation of these threats that ultimately displaces people, making them climate refugees. Climate breakdown is creating climate refugees all over the world. Here are three examples of forced displacement due to climate change. We start with Somalia because, as Laura Heaton warns us, “as one of the hardest hit on the planet by climate change, Somalia is the canary in the coal mine for the rest of us.” Located in east Africa, people throughout Somalia are being forcibly displaced. Recurring droughts and other effects of climate breakdown in Somalia are creating poverty, hunger, and displacement. People are fleeing their homes to go to the capital, Mogadishu, or crossing borders to neighboring countries. Armed groups use the poverty and desperation created by climate breakdown to recruit members, wreaking more violence on communities, and creating more displacement. The worst is the drought, because with something to eat you can tolerate jail or any punishment [...b]ut facing starvation is worse than insecurity. — Mohamed Abukar, Somali farmer The fact that many of our youth have lost jobs because of desertification, deforestation … It’s not the only cause, of course, of radicalization, but this is one of the major causes of radicalization because of the linkages between violence and environmental degradation. — Buri Hamza, former State Minister of the Environment for Somalia NB: Buri Hamza was killed in an attack by al Shabab in a hotel one month after this interview. I’m betting we’ll vanish from the earth. Somalis will vanish from Somalia [...a]nd you know what? It’s not going to vanish only due to drought; it’s going to vanish due to drought that will bring wars, because we will fight like chickens with a small amount of crumbs. We’ll eat each other alive because this environment is not giving us anymore. — Fatima Jibrell, environmental activist https://thegroundtruthproject.org/somalia-conflict-climate-change/ Located in south Asia, sharing India’s eastern border, and on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladeshis mostly from rural coastal areas are becoming climate refugees. Climate breakdown is creating increased flooding and coastal erosion. Storms are coming harder and each time a catastrophe hits it is harder and harder to rebuild. Bangladesh loses an area the size of Manhattan each year, and is projected to have as many as 13.3 million climate refugees by 2050. People are losing livelihoods and homes and moving en masse to the capital and elsewhere. Climate change has wrecked everything; our people are living in other towns and cities, like refugees. All I wanted was to grow old with my children and their children. But now they are gone and I don’t think they will ever return. — Shamisur Gazi, 83, Chakbara, Bangladesh God knows how long this village will last. If it gets worse I will have to go to the mainland. We know the end is coming. — Jakir Hossain, Bangladeshi fisherman The land here used to be 1 km out to sea…We lost mosques, a school, shops, farms. We are scared of the sea now. Gradually it comes closer to our homes. When we sleep, we are scared. Every year the tide rises more and comes in further. Next year this village may not exist. — Mohamed Rashed, Qumira Char, Bangladesh http://climatemigration.org.uk/migration-stories-from-the-ganges-brahmaputra-delta-2/ The coastal town of Fairbourne, in north Wales. Rising sea levels are threatening to make the town uninhabitable within the next 30 years. In 2013 the town council decided to stop defending the town and give it up to the sea. It will begin relocating residents in 2045, but possibly earlier. Residents are unsure if they will receive financial compensation when the town is ‘decommissioned’. This is not the only town in the UK to be threatened by the rising sea. This is a wake-up call for the country. This is going to happen elsewhere. — Bev Wilkins, 67, Retiree People who want to sell are taking very cheap cash deals. I can’t do that. Where am I going to go? I wouldn’t get enough money to get another house [...h]ow the authorities can sit there and push this forward with no solutions beggars belief. — Mike Thrussell, Journalist We don’t have options. We are just pawns. — Julia Walker, 32, Mother of 4 https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/this-is-a-wake-up-call-the-villagers-who-could-be-britains-first-climate-refugees Broken sea ramp, left unfixed in Fairbourne, Wales, Photo by Julia Wilson While international bodies are bogged down in treaties and semantics, climate breakdown is forcing people around the world to leave their homes. It affects everyone, regardless of income. But we know that it is society’s most vulnerable who are hit hardest and have the fewest resources to rely on. The climate is changing fast, and people are losing their homes, and will continue to do so— regardless of whatever legal category the UN and other international bodies put them in. Photo by Ethan Doyle White, Wikipedia Climate refugees have lost their homes. But they have often also lost their income, stability, community, security of life, and dreams for their future. They have lost everything to something that is preventable. We must continue to petition governments to protect people against harm. We must continue to hold them accountable for their roles in furthering climate breakdown. We must continue to demand governments treat refugees as humans and not disposable ‘problems'. Reactive measures of ‘adaptation’ are not enough. Proactive prevention of further climate breakdown must be at the heart of government actions, and it must be now. Because right now millions of people around the world are seeking refuge in new places. We must work to welcome refugees into our communities and support them and stand in solidarity with them. Our place in life is a roll of the dice of fate, and we should extend the kindness and justice to others that we would hope others would extend to us were the roles reversed. As Lauren Markham reminds us, “People don’t want to be raped along the route north, or die in the desert, or have their child ripped away from them by the border patrol, or be locked up indefinitely without legal counsel, without adequate medical care, with no idea what will happen to them and when. Who would risk this if things were OK back home?” Photo by Alisdare Hickson Many hold the year 2050 in their minds’ eye as a crucial date for the climate emergency. Indeed, projections say that by 2050 climate breakdown may have displaced 1.2 billion people. But this is not a done deal—it is up to us to shape and influence government actions in the next 30 years.

From the far south to the frozen north, from mining protests in Patagonia (left) to the snowy streets of Warsaw (right), young rebels have been making their presence felt. 25 JAN - 8 FEB | Czech Republic: Czech rebels mounted an online campaign against fast fashion. ‘To Na Sebe Nvemu!, meaning I DON’T WEAR IT! 26 JAN | France: Rebels in Orleans covered consumer advertising with a ‘tapestry’ made of face masks. Covid-19 isn’t the only virus from which we need protection, they said, there is also the virus of advertising. In the city of Poitiers, the message was more direct: Make love, not shops! 28 JAN | Argentina: Members of Extinction Rebellion Mendoza joined a protest against the expansion of silver mining in Chubut province in Patagonia. Pan American Silver is seeking to exploit deposits on territory occupied by Mapuche and Tehuelche peoples. The communities say the provincial government has failed to consult them as required by the Argentine constitution and they condemn acts of arbitrary arrest and institutional violence committed by the Chubut government against people protesting the ‘mega mining’. 29 JAN | Canada: Four brave Vancouver rebels were arrested protesting against the Trans Mountain Extension Pipeline. The action took place on unceded Coast Salish territory, and the rebels had permission from the host nation to make the protest. One of those arrested said: “We need to be taking action even during Covid because this pipeline must be stopped before it irreparably harms our environment, our relationships with first nations and the last chance we have to avoid climate breakdown.” Photos: XR Vancouver. 20 JAN | UK: After 10 days without food, Lissy Green and Elijah McKenzee ended their hunger strike against a planned new coal mine in Cumbria. They were advised that weight loss and weakness could lead to hospitalisation at a time when the UK health service is under unprecedented pressure due to Covid. Their protest remained unacknowledged by the UK government. 31 JAN | Reunion Island: Extinction Rebellion has spread around the world, even to the small Indian Ocean island of Reunion, population 860,000, where rebels and others in Saint Leu amassed 1,500 kg of plastic and other waste and dumped it in front of the town hall to protest against poor garbage collection. Reunion is a department of France. 9 JAN | France: Normandy rebels decorated motorway bridges near Caen with the message: AIR POLLUTION = 48,000 DEATHS PER YEAR. Several activists were arrested and later sentenced to 35 hours community service, which they refused, stating that their actions were itself a service to the community, nature, and the planet. 25 JAN | Poland: Extinction Rebellion activists took to the streets of Wrocław to give a clear signal: enough apathy, it is ‘Time For Rebellion’ (Czas Na Bunt). 17 JAN | Spain: The blue-costumed sea brigade of Extinction Rebellion Murcia was collecting signatures for a law to grant legal rights - as a ‘legal person’ - to the Mar Menor (’Minor Sea’), a huge ecologically important saltwater lagoon separated from the Mediterranean (Mar Mayor) by a 22km long sandbar. The lagoon has been heavily polluted, mainly by nutrient runoff from agriculture, in what activists call a clear case of ecocide. The proposed law would recognise the right of the lagoon to “exist as an ecosystem” and to be protected and preserved by three groups: legal guardians, a monitoring committee of “protectors”, and a scientific advisory board. Any citizen or legal entity would be able to file a lawsuit on behalf of the Mar Menor. 18 JAN | Australia: Rebels joined with Fossil Free South Australia to hold a bicycle die-in action in central Adelaide.

The activists trekking across Africa to save Okavango. Photo: First Peoples Southern Africa Elsewhere in this issue we celebrate the extreme disobedience of the tunnel-diggers of Stop HS2 - their cause named after the high cost, high carbon, high speed railway that’s devastating English woodland. We also cover an epic walk to stop the scandalous plunder of the Okavango basin by Recon Oil. The Book of the Month section has been infused with your recommendations (thanks for all of them - and keep them coming!) Lastly, this issue marks the return of Humans of XR. If you know (or are) a rebel somewhere in the world with a story to tell, get in touch at xr-newsletter@protonmail.com If you’d like to help, please check out our website and learn more about XR. To connect to rebels in your local area, get in touch with your nearest XR group. If there’s no active group near you, you can start your own! If you’d like to see previous newsletter issues, you can find them here. We are in a crucial phase of human history, and our Rebellion needs money to make our message heard. Anything you can give is appreciated. Support the Rebellion JAN | Washington State, USA What do you get when you bring together climate activists, a local XR group, indigenous peoples, 5 key legislators, crowd-funding, climate experts and several organisations? The Washington Climate Assembly (WACA)! Inspired by XR's 3rd Demand, this is the first Climate Assembly to take place in the US, and it is hoped that WACA will provide the blueprint for many more across America and the world. WACA has flourished thanks to an open-arm approach to other movements. Organisers have reached out to a range of local activist groups as well as politicians on both sides of the political aisle, and rebels from XR Seattle now work on the project full time. WACA is taking place online due to Covid. Think of this as a symbolic image. WACA has been crowd-funded by local activists rather than commissioned by the state government. While politicians persist in sidelining the Climate Emergency, WACA shows what can be achieved by organised citizens pooling their resources. Members of citizens’ assemblies are chosen through sortition - a technical term for random selection - which ensures they are representative of the whole community. However participation is not mandatory, and people who receive an invitation may have good reason not to attend. With so many communities' fire-fighting Covid, and black and indigenous groups being particularly affected, organisers decided to delay WACA by 3 months to ensure widespread participation. Assembly recommendations will now be finalised in March. An Earth Day Livestream on organising the Climate Assembly The 80 citizens selected for WACA have just completed learning sessions informed by the latest data from climate experts, and are about to enter the deliberation phase. This is where they will debate what they have learnt and form their recommendations. So far the response from the assembly has been positive, with many enthused by what they are learning and happy that their voice is being heard. Meanwhile, WACA organisers like The People's Voice on Climate are busy mobilising support from as many groups, communities, and politicians as possible to ensure that WACA’s recommendations lead to direct changes in the law. Their main hope is that WACA will prove that the climate assembly model works, and put it on the map for others to replicate. They are already in talks with XR New York, whose own campaign for a climate assembly is well underway - their brilliant citizens’ assembly handbook was recently delivered to New York City Council and can be found in Must Reads. FEB 1 | Southern Africa Photo: First Peoples Southern Africa In our last issue we reported how Canadian oil firm ReconAfrica obtained drilling rights in the nature reserves of the Okavango Basin that spans Namibia and Botswana, and how a protest movement was forming against it. Now an indigenous-led group of ten people, mainly from the local Khoe and San communities, have begun a 930 mile walk across South Africa to the Namibian embassy in Capetown, where they are going to deliver a petition and formal objection against the drilling. The walkers are covering an ambitious 60 km per day, with some choosing to go barefoot. On the way they are informing locals about the drilling and collecting signatures against it. The walk was organised by First Peoples Southern Africa along with other groups, and is being covered by XR in an ongoing series of live stream interviews with experts and community leaders. The ReconAfrica drilling site. Photo: Frack Free Namibia & Botswana Namibian activists fear the situation will play out just like Shell’s ruinous plundering of the Niger Delta, and their concerns seem more than justified. ReconAfrica began drilling its first test well in January with a multi-million dollar rig from Texas and a local activist press release revealed that a pond for wastewater from the drilling doesn’t appear to have a water-proof lining. Without proper lining, the toxic wastewater can leach into the groundwater - endangering local wildlife, crops and people. In an in-depth report by National Geographic (which triggered ReconAfrica to threaten legal action) the oil company was criticized for not physically assessing the environment and relying on paperwork to plan the drilling. JAN | London, UK An anti-HS2 tunneler slinks back into the tunnels after bailiffs spend 25 hours cutting through his armlock. Photo: Boots On The Ground News Dug under the cover of night over several months, 9 activists finally settled into a series of underground tunnels in the early morning of 27 January when bailiffs stormed their camp. The tunnels stretched upto 30 meters long and ran under a garden forecourt of Euston Station, one of London’s busiest train stations. Their purpose was to block the construction of HS2, a high-speed railway linking London to cities in the north of the UK. The UK government claimed HS2 would be a climate-friendly jewel in its transport crown, but according to its own calculations, it will never achieve carbon neutrality, and only 5% of its passengers would have driven or flown instead. On top of that, its construction will destroy 5 internationally protected wildlife areas, 108 ancient woodlands, 33 sites of special scientific interest, and 693 local wildlife sites. It will also cost £100 billion in public money. All that just to slice a few minutes off the morning commute. An evictor confronts a tree protector. Photo: Joshua Windsor The tunnels were dug by members of a tree-protector camp which has occupied the gardens outside Euston station since the end of the UK’s September Rebellion. The Euston Square camp happens to face the head office of HS2 Ltd, and over the months has become a regenerative community, welcoming the homeless people who shelter around the station. It’s just one of a number of camps along the proposed HS2 route which together represent the Stop HS2 campaign. While some of the tunnel dwellers are seasoned architects, most are still teenagers. They have supplies to ‘last months’, are strong in spirit, and are not ‘planning to go anytime soon’. While acknowledging the inherent risk of such an action, they add that health and safety has been at the centre of their decisions, of which the same cannot be said for the bailiffs of the National Eviction Team (NET). The activists have warned that NET attempts to remove them could cause a major collapse of the tunnels, but a high court judge recently rejected their concerns. Confined space rescue specialists have been denied access to the site, while HS2 Ltd has got gagging orders on hundreds of companies, of which NET is one. Extinction Rebellion UK has expressed solidarity with the HS2 tunnelers. A few days into the underground occupation, 4 rebels climbed onto the roof of the HS2 offices for a banner drop.

The wetlands are home to many endemic species and play a major role in controlling floods in the capital Colombo, but are threatened by pollution and illegal encroachment. The 59 bags of collected waste were recycled or sent for co-processing. Sri Lankan rebels will repeat the clean up every month until the wetlands are entirely free from waste.

XR Unchained 4 MARCH | Norwegian Embassies worldwide XR Norway is calling for rebels to stand in solidarity with the 53 Norweigan rebels who are standing trial for blockading the country’s Oil and Energy Ministry last year. On 4 March XR Norway will hold a non-violent action at the Ministry of Justice in Oslo. XR Norway asks rebels around the world to assemble peacefully on the same day outside Norwegian embassies and consulates with the message “To the Oil State of Norway: Stop Suppressing Climate Activism!” and “Erna Solberg: We See the Hypocrisy” (Erna Solberg has been prime minister of Norway since 2013). Read more about the action and attend the Zoom meeting on 17 February at 19:00 (UTC). Groups planning to join the action should write to XRNSolidarity@protonmail.com 25 - 28 MARCH | Worldwide Scientist Rebellion is asking academics and scientists around the world to go beyond giving warnings that fall on deaf ears. Act as if the truth is real and join us for 4 days of direct action. We will paste scientific papers to buildings in small, socially distanced groups. We will go on 1-3 day hunger strikes if we cannot risk arrest / leave the house but are in good health. We will provide materials for educational disobedience so planned learning can be replaced by lessons on the climate crisis. Sign up and help make this the largest-ever mobilisation of scientists in direct action. 27 MARCH | Global Coming out of this pandemic will be our last, best chance to remake the world, yet governments around the world are throwing it away. It’s terrifying. We need to do something … in March, we will. Join Rebellion of One and be part of XR’s first international mass civil disobedience of 2021. Rebellion Of One is a brand new tactic: a single-person roadblock... times 1,000. Each rebel wears a sign with a simple and emotive message. They sit in the road alone until they choose to move or are moved. But they have an incognito support team hiding in plain sight nearby. A programme of special training materials has been assembled to help people prepare for the action. We will not be bystanders while the world burns. Watch a short yet powerful video of the UK trial runs, read the full action briefing and sign up. 18 FEB | 18:00 - 19:30 GMT | Online Two years ago, we issued a global callout for letters in response to the climate and ecological emergency. We collected them into a book called Letters to the Earth. Join award winning authors, activists, and academics as they read out their letters for the live paperback book launch, with the invitation again for everyone to write and share their letters. Guests include Booker Prize winning poet, Ben Okri; award-winning novelist, Anna Hope; environmental lawyer, Farhana Yamin; Earth Systems Analysis expert, Professor Stefan Rhamstorf; and climate justice essayist, Mary Annaïse Heglar.

Watch the launch video, learn more about the ambitious project, and get involved Last month we asked you to recommend your favorite climate-related books and you responded with so much great material we will need multiple newsletters to cover them all. But the book this month is an easy choice - so many of you recommended the same one! A Life on Our Planet, the companion book to the documentary of the same name, is half Attenborough’s personal experience as a witness of decades of environmental disaster, half his recommendations for healing and rewilding the planet. It’s an inspiring plea for change from one of the most respected environmental educators around - a plea by one of the world’s most beloved humans for the imperiled planet he so clearly loves. Here are a few other books recommended by readers... The Overstory by Richard Powers. A brilliant novel exploring the lives of people transformed, in one way or another, by trees. Though fiction, it’s meticulously researched - the politics, activism, and science are all real. ""My favourite read in a very long time"" (Sarah) Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants by Robin Wall Kimmerer. A lovely memoir exploring the author’s use of both science and her Potawatomie cultural heritage to understand plants. ""It’s bloody awesome!"" (Nick) Our House Is On Fire: Greta Thunberg’s Call to Save the Planet by Jeanette Winter. A children’s picture-book about Greta Thunberg and her powerful message. Adults can read it, too, of course. ""Very moving, not only about the climate crisis, but also about a family which struggles everyday to help their children come to terms with a world with insane values"" (David) Avoid Amazon. Support local bookshops by buying your books at Bookshop or Hive. I volunteer as an XR regional liaison for Africa alongside another rebel from Gambia. We help local XR groups in Africa get support and put them on the map of the global movement. I was working with Universal Versatile Society to raise awareness about Indian farmers committing suicide due to failed harvests linked to climate change, when I came across the global XR website. I joined in February 2019 with deeper expectations of saving the planet and its species from getting EXTINCT like the farmers who were committing suicide. It is too difficult for some rebels to participate unless they are being given enough financial support, especially taking into account the political environment. I am heavily involved in the Save Bugoma Forest campaign and helped organise the recent COVID awareness campaign. We are currently planning another visit to women and children affected by floods in Kasese. What I found hard was encountering some rebels who do not know anything about the African continent but have biased attitudes towards us Africans, maybe with motives of silently practicing colonialism. It's challenging, but following our principles and values, we still work together to achieve our main purpose. Another challenge are the natural calamities due to progressing climate change in the region - like the regular landslides near Mount Elgon, locusts destroying farmer’s crops and, of course, hunger due to seasonal crop failure. An unexpected aspect of my work with XR was to see African rebels come together to help a rebel from Zambia who was stuck in a flooded home. We reached out online to the authorities in the neighbouring country of South Africa to quickly have the rebel rescued. The success of the Save Nairobi National park campaign was unexpected as well. I cannot post my deeper thoughts about Uganda freely. In my activism, I avoid any direct political actions and restrict my participation and advocacy to creating awareness of the ecological and social challenges posed by climate change.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/01/18/biodiversity-definition-losing-importance/,"Imagine this. You’re on a plane with about 100 other passengers. You look out the window to the warm glow of an early morning sunrise and you feel safe and at peace. Suddenly, something on the wing of the plane catches your eyes. A loose bolt. You watch as it slowly wobbles out of place and is whisked away in the blink of an eye. You inhale deeply, close your eyes, and tell yourself that it’s just one bolt, the plane will be fine. When you open your eyes again, you notice another bolt a little further out on the wing slowly unwinding. Your heart rate increases as it is promptly whisked away too. The plane doesn’t seem affected but your mind becomes consumed with thoughts that make you very uneasy. You snap the window shut and close your eyes again. If you don’t look outside, you won’t worry as much. A short while later, the plane lurches violently and the passengers around you scream in surprise. You know that more bolts have wriggled loose outside your window. You know this plane is going to crash. But now there is nothing you can do. An analogy similar to this one was first used by Paul Ehrlich and Brian Walker in 1998 to simplify the complex concept that is biodiversity and how it is affected by species loss. The plane is our planet. The bolts are its species. The wind that is whisking them away is us. We are hurtling towards disaster and for a long time we’ve simply just been watching it happen. But it’s not too late to change our fate. Source: Boris Smokrovic, Unsplash You’ve probably heard the word ‘biodiversity’ mentioned in recent discussions around the environment. But what exactly does it mean? In simple terms, biodiversity is the foundation of life. It is the variety of creatures that exist on Earth – from the largest (e.g., whales) to the smallest (e.g., bacteria) – and how they interact with one another. In many ways, it is what is keeping you and me and everything else on this planet alive. When a single part of biodiversity is lost or degraded, this negatively affects the functioning of the whole system. This is why issues such as the decline of bee populations are very worrisome. These tiny insects are important in the survival of ecosystems that create food sources for many different species, including us. If bees disappeared, life as we know it would change. Many of the fruits, vegetables and nuts that we currently enjoy would become scarce or disappear entirely (no more apples, almonds, blueberries, or cherries!). The majority of wildflower species would wither and die, draining the world of its natural vibrant colour. Bee-dependent animals such as birds, spiders, butterflies, and squirrels would also likely disappear sparking other animal species who rely on them to vanish too. A planet without bees is not a planet we should ever have to live on. This is what can happen when a single important piece of the biodiversity puzzle is lost. But the problem doesn’t end with bees. We are currently losing biodiversity globally at an alarming rate. Around one million plant and animal species are now threatened with extinction – a number that hasn’t been witnessed before in all of human history. This has led scientists to declare that Earth is currently undergoing its 6th mass species extinction. And while extinction is a natural process, it is currently occurring 1000 times faster than normal and humans are responsible. This means that we are heading towards a future where many of our beloved animal species such as the Bengal tiger, the northern white rhinoceros, and the Asian elephant may no longer exist. A future where many of the foods we enjoy today such as chips, chocolate, and coffee are but a distant memory of a better past. It’s a pretty bleak picture. So what can we do about it? In order to determine the right solutions, it is first important to understand the different types of biodiversity and their effect on the environment so we can work towards preserving them. Source: David Clode, Unsplash Our planet is a lot like us. In much the same way that we rely on our hearts, lungs, and muscles to keep us alive and strong, our planet relies on biodiversity to do the same. In order to do this well, the planet needs a good balance between three different types of diversity: genetic diversity, species diversity, and ecosystem diversity. Now, imagine these three types of biodiversity as like a tower of blocks. If we remove one or push one askew, this can cause the whole thing to topple over or become very wobbly. For example, if genetic diversity begins to decline in a specific group of animals, this will impact the species diversity of that area and eventually alter the balance of ecosystem diversity. This is something that is happening right now to animal populations all over the world. For example, in Australia, the Tasmanian devil is an animal that is on the brink of extinction due to its poor genetic diversity. As a result of the devil’s small gene pool, a rare contagious cancer has wiped out 80% of the population.This has led to species diversity declining in Tasmanian habitats due to the European red fox replacing the devils as the primary predator and killing a greater number of native species. When these native species go extinct, it greatly changes the ecosystem and as a result, reduces Tasmania’s overall ecosystem diversity. This is why we must work towards protecting all types of biodiversity to ensure that our world doesn’t topple and crash under the pressure of our inaction. Source: Michal Jarmoluk, Pixabay Humanity owes a lot to biodiversity. Our lives and the ways in which we get to enjoy them are only possible because of it. We don’t realise just how many gifts biodiversity has given us because modern society has become so far removed from nature. So what exactly does biodiversity do for us? Biodiversity brings many benefits to humans, including: Source: Pixabay Humans aren’t the only ones to benefit from biodiversity. Nature does, too. Without biodiversity, the many different environments that we get to enjoy today would no longer exist. Imagine a world with no greenery and desert-like landscapes, lifeless and lonely; a mirror image of Mars. That is what we are heading towards if we don’t preserve biodiversity and allow it to nurture the following environmental benefits: When we recognise the value that biodiversity gives us and the environment, great things can happen. For example, in the United Kingdom, an area of farmland known as the Knepp Estate went from being a biological wasteland to a biodiverse paradise simply because actions were taken to allow nature to do its job. This shows that we can create a world where we don’t have to sacrifice biodiversity and all the benefits it brings. Okay, so by now you’re probably itching to know what actions you can take to help. But in order to do that, let’s first look at the actions that are causing biodiversity to disappear. Source: Free-Photos, Pixabay In their 2019 report, the United Nations identified five main ways in which humans are causing biodiversity’s “dangerous” and “unprecedented” decline. They are as follows: Humans are natural explorers. Throughout history, we have taken great pride in conquering new lands and travelling the wildest seas. But this has come at a cost. Our discoveries have led us to treat the environment simply as a service to satisfy our needs. As we continue to demand more from our land and sea to keep up with our rising numbers and appetites, biodiversity suffers. For example, the two most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth (i.e., rainforests and coral reefs) have suffered greatly at the hands of humans. Our hunger for meat and our need for space has led to more than 150 acres of rainforest being lost every single minute of every single day! In addition to that, our disregard for the biodiversity of our oceans has already caused half of the world’s coral reefs to disappear or degrade. Throughout history, humans have tended to view nature as an endless supply of food, water, and shelter. But it’s only recently that we are starting to discover that the environment has a limit. And we have already begun to push past it. This is most evident in the overfishing crisis which has become one of the most serious threats to ocean biodiversity in history. The global demand for fish has caused many important fish populations to be pushed to the brink of extinction. We know that biodiversity is sensitive to an imbalance in species. So when fish numbers drop, this impacts other predator and prey species in the ocean, causing an imbalance in the ecosystem. For example, a coastal fishing town in California known as Monterey Bay once had a thriving fishing industry thanks to large numbers of sardines calling the bay home. However, overfishing caused the sardine population to completely crash and both humans and other species suffered as a result. Humans lost their livelihoods while animal species who relied on the sardines for food lost their lives. This demonstrates that when we take more than our fair share from the environment and its species, we hurt ourselves and other species in the process. Source: Francesco Ungaro, Unsplash We humans are a clever bunch. The brains we were blessed with have allowed us to develop industries and technologies that make life so much easier. And while this is great for us, it’s not so great for the planet. As our industries have become bigger and better, our dependence on the environment has also grown. We chop down trees by the thousands to make way for animals that become our food and we burn the treasures that we dig up from the earth to power our homes. Activities like this have caused the natural heat-trapping gases contained safely inside the trees and the earth (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) to be constantly released into the air. And from this process, one of the most terrifying and powerful threats to humanity and all life on Earth has emerged: climate change. We are in an age where climate change is making itself known in terrifying ways. The Antarctic glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, and natural disasters are becoming more frequent and more dangerous. But what climate change has done to biodiversity is one of the greatest tragedies of our time. It has helped to speed up species extinction by forcing plants and animals to exist in environments that no longer support their needs. For example, as global temperatures have risen, some of the ocean’s tiniest and those most important to marine biodiversity have struggled to adapt (e.g., phytoplankton, coral, shellfish). As a result of ocean water changing in response to rising carbon dioxide levels and increasing temperature, they have all begun to die. When these species begin to decline, a ripple effect occurs along the food chain with other species also suffering as their food and homes begin to disappear. And extinction becomes a widespread problem. Another way that humans have taken advantage of the environment is by treating it like a wasteland. Our destructive ways have led to the air, water, and land all becoming choked with pollution. Did you know that between 4.8 and 12.7 million tons of plastic enter the ocean every year? It’s probably not surprising that as many as 700 ocean species are now threatened with extinction as a direct result of plastic pollution. But we humans should be worried about plastic pollution too. Microplastics (i.e., tiny plastic particles) are now being found in the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink. Scientists haven’t been able to fully understand the consequences of this on our health just yet, but based on its impact on fish and other ocean animals, it doesn’t look too good. And this is only one aspect of pollution that is wreaking havoc on our world. Other issues such as global waste, dumping of toxic chemicals, and oil spills are also impacting biodiversity by changing the soil, water, and air quality. But just as we can make the problem worse, we also have the power to make it much better. The Covid19 pandemic was the perfect example of just how much we stand to benefit from reducing our pollutive ways when it comes to things like improving air and water quality. Source: Brian Wangenheim, Unsplash There’s a good reason why stories about the adventures of feral cats and pigs often make the news. They’re known as invasive species and they’re bad news for the environment. An invasive species is any animal, plant, or other species (e.g., viruses) that has been introduced to an area that they weren’t present in before. They’re often spread from place to place through human activities such as trade, travel, and shipping. Once an invasive species arrives in their new area, they can greatly disrupt the established order of ecosystems by messing with the natural balance of biodiversity. There are plenty of stories from around the world where invasive species have become a serious threat to native plant and animal populations. One such story is that of a tiny insect that decided to hitch a ride on a boat from Asia to the United States in the 1950s. That tiny insect was the hemlock woolly adelgid and it is now on track to destroy 80% of Eastern USA hemlock trees by 2022. As a result, the birds that relied solely on the hemlock trees to nest and keep safe from predators have almost completely disappeared. The animals in the forest waterways are expected to suffer too as the water temperature is predicted to rise as a result of loss of shade that the trees used to provide. This means that animals who rely on cooler water temperatures to survive (e.g., trout) will begin to decline in numbers. That’s a whole lot of damage to come from a little bug! From possums in New Zealand to grey squirrels in the United Kingdom, the story is the same. Biodiversity is altered and the environment is pushed to its limits when invasive species arrive. Source: PublicDomainImages, Pixabay It’s come to a point in time where we need to ask ourselves a very difficult question: are we willing to sacrifice our own lives and those we share the planet with for the sake of continued profit and growth? Because we are at a crossroads and we must choose our path today. Humans have known for long enough that preventing further loss of biodiversity is important to our own survival. But what have we got to show for it? Our response to one of the greatest environmental emergencies to have ever existed has been dismal. In fact, a recent United Nations report revealed that not a single one of the 20 targets agreed upon by governments to address biodiversity loss over 10 years ago have been fully met. But there is a glimmer of hope to be found. Amongst the failures, there has also been some partial progress towards improving the situation. For example, more land and sea areas are now protected under environmental laws, more money is being spent on biodiversity projects, and biodiversity awareness and knowledge amongst the public has improved thanks to joint government efforts. In fact, a recent United Nations summit on biodiversity revealed that seven mammal species (such as the black-footed ferret) have been saved from the brink of extinction in the past decade as a result of conservation projects brought about by the 2010 agreement. But if this isn’t proof enough that we can change course, then let our past inspire you. History has shown that the actions we take to protect the environment can change the outcome. For example, in 1987 an international treaty was signed to ban the use of harmful chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in hairspray, as they were known to deplete Earth’s ozone layer. Since then, the amount of CFCs present in the atmosphere has steadily decreased. It was an environmental victory that showed that we have the power to turn a bad situation around. But the power doesn’t only lie in the hands of governments and environmental organisations. We have the power to create change too. Taking our own steps towards improving biodiversity is something we can all do to help. By becoming aware of our own behaviours and how they can impact the environment, we can make some small changes towards helping the planet. Source: NickyPe, Pixabay Here are three actions you can take to help prevent biodiversity loss. One of the best actions you can take is to reduce your own environmental impact by lowering your ecological footprint. An ecological footprint is a measure of the amount of nature’s resources that we consume (water, gas, cropland, forest, etc.). You can calculate your own here. By reducing your ecological footprint you can help to slow the demand for goods and services that are threatening biodiversity. Here are five simple actions you can take to reduce your ecological footprint. Reducing your ecological footprint is much like reducing your carbon footprint (i.e., the amount of carbon emissions you contribute to the atmosphere). Both will reduce your consumption and use of Earth’s resources. Biodiversity is an issue that cannot be resolved without governments passing laws and funding projects that preserve it. Urgent mass action is required and this can be achieved by putting pressure on government leaders to make biodiversity a priority. You can communicate your concern for the environment and help to create change by using your voice and your vote. Depending on where you live and what you feel comfortable doing, you can take actions such as writing to your local member about your concerns related to the biodiversity crisis or voting for parties that have environmental issues on the agenda. What will this achieve? The more people that speak up about the biodiversity crisis, the more pressure governments are under to take the necessary action. Source: Markus Spiske, Unsplash We are currently at a critical and unique moment of time where we have the opportunity to start anew when it comes to prioritising the health of our planet. The global Covid19 pandemic put a stop to many destructive human activities and the environment has largely benefited as a result. If we continue as usual and refuse to make the necessary changes to prevent biodiversity loss, we will lose our most valuable life system. Many big businesses have so far been resistant to changes in the way that they operate. In their endless pursuit of profit and power, these corporations have caused nature to suffer tremendously. At a time when climate change and biodiversity loss are leading to risks to our own health and wellbeing, it is clear that something needs to be done. And fast. Let us not let this opportunity to change course go to waste. It’s time to stand in united outrage against the inexcusable ‘business as usual’ attitude of those in power. It’s time to fight for our planet’s future and the survival of all life on earth. For the sake of biodiversity – the fragile, complex, and astonishingly nurturing system that gives Earth its unique beauty and keeps us alive.

When Extinction Rebellion first hit the world’s headlines, it was because rebels were willing to break the law to raise awareness about the climate crisis. But last year saw a marked shift in climate activism’s relationship with the law. Across the globe communities and organisations have started to use existing laws, and even create new ones, to hold governments and polluting corporations to account. We’ve seen young people all around the world, from Mexico to South Korea, sue their governments for negligent climate policy. We’ve seen Portuguese youth activists have their landmark case against all 33 European states fast-tracked to the European Court of Human Rights. And we’ve seen a vast array of lawsuits brought against major oil firms by US states, cities, and communities. The Portuguese youth activists taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Photos: GLAN You can find out more about this flurry of climate litigation in Must Reads, along with some examples where the law is not so much an asset to the climate cause as an ass. The focus meanwhile for this legal-eagle special issue will be on two campaigns aiming to create new laws for activists to harness in the future. The Climate & Ecological Emergency Bill was introduced to UK’s Parliament in September and aims to turn XR’s demands into British law. As well as building local support, the team behind it have expanded the legislation so it can be applied to any government in the run up to COP26. Meanwhile thanks to the Stop Ecocide campaign, a team of international lawyers are drafting new legislation to make Ecocide a crime. One day soon, negligent politicians and polluting CEOs could find themselves in the dock of the International Criminal Court! Politicians lose their spines before a media mogul in Melbourne. So that’s what happens. To find out more about both campaigns and get involved, head over to Action Highlights.

A campaign to introduce major new climate-ecology legislation in the UK now has the backing of 89 Ministers of Parliament (MPs) who together represent 6 million citizens, as well as 5 councils and Greenpeace UK. Written by an alliance of scientists, lawyers, economists and activists (including rebels), the Climate and Ecological Emergency (CEE) Bill will legally require the UK Government to take urgent and far-reaching climate action, with the terms directed by a Citizens’ Assembly as well as MPs. The CEE Bill would also force the UK to take responsibility for its overseas carbon and ecological footprint (currently ignored), and do its fair share in reducing global emissions considering it is an advanced economy. The UK’s only Green Party MP accepts a letter from young rebels before tabling the CEE Bill. With COP26 scheduled for this November, the team behind the CEE Bill have broadened its contents to create a universal blueprint of emergency measures. The Face the Future 10-Point Plan could apply to the government of any advanced economy, and even be integrated into the Paris Agreement. The Face The Future team are now calling on activists and organisations around the world to pressure their government to sign up to these 10 principles. The Plan has already been backed by rebels in the UK, France, Italy and Germany. If you would like your government to Face The Future in time for COP26, then check out these campaigning ideas, take this online training on engaging political representatives, and use these templates to start lobbying your local politicians.

Photo: Wikipedia Fifteen years ago, while looking out of a window during a court case, barrister Polly Higgins had a thought: “The earth is in need of a good lawyer”. So began her lifelong battle to make ecocide - widespread, severe, or systematic destruction of nature - a crime prosecutable in court. Although Polly Higgins sadly died in 2019, this idea - shared by many others worldwide - is sparking a revolution. In December 2019, island states Vanuatu and the Maldives called for “serious consideration” of the criminalisation of ecocide at an annual assembly of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In December, Belgium became the first European nation to raise the issue at the ICC. And right now international lawyers are working on a legal definition of ecocide as an international crime that could sit alongside war crimes and crimes against humanity. Stop Ecocide activists pose in front of a familiar pink boat. Photo: Stop Ecocide The worst punishment currently faced by people, businesses and states wreaking irreversible destruction on habitats is a fine or an order to pay compensation.

Rebels in Ashkelon find an alternative use for lengths of pipe. Photo: XR Israel XR Israel launched a fortnight of nationwide actions last month, with the rebellion wave kicking off in the coastal city of Ashkelon. 40 brave rebels blocked the entrance to both the giant coal-fired Rothberg Power Station and the Eilat Ashkelon Pipeline Company, whose pipeline pumps millions of barrels of crude oil every day between ports on the Mediterrean and Red Sea. Rebels managed to block traffic to the sites for two hours and recruit more rebels to their cause. An affinity group focused on the pipeline is now being set up. A fissure in the pipeline in 2014 flooded the Evrona Nature Reserve with oil, and was labelled one of Israel's worst environmental catastrophes. Nevertheless the pipeline’s operator recently secured a lucrative oil deal with the United Arab Emirates. Rebels tend to a supersize turd in Migdal Group’s lobby. Signs read ‘Greenwash: Same Shit, Now in Green’ & ‘Diverting Attention, Not Investments’. Photo: XR Israel A week later rebels in the central city of Petah Tikva entered the lobby of Migdal Group, one of the biggest pension funds in Israel. To encourage the group to stop greenwashing their dirty investments, the plucky rebels brought a big pile of fake excrement with them and basted it with a generous supply of green slime. Migdal invests over $1.5 billion a year in fossil fuels, and has a history of branding itself sustainable with little evidence. But following the rebel action the company stated it will apply environmental and social criteria to investment choices and ditched recently bought stock in the oil company Delek. The rebellion wave closed in the capital Jerusalem. 100 rebels disrupted the city for several hours by blocking the two exits of the Ministry of Energy, where the Prime Minister recently raised Israel’s renewable energy target to 30%, even though the current 17% target is far from being met, underlining how talking targets can bear little relation to action on the ground. Ongoing | Botswana, Namibia The Okavango Delta. The Kavango Basin is a vast water system that spreads across Namibia, Botswana and the Okavango Delta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the planet’s largest wetlands. Rather than protect this unique habitat, home to endangered species and the world’s largest elephant population, last year both Namibia’s and Botswana’s governments gave Canadian oil company ReconAfrica the rights to drill it. The company has been given an area bordering 3 national parks upstream of the Okavango Delta, and started drilling test boreholes in December. Local activists from groups including Frack Free Namibia and Fridays For Future Windhoek have scrambled to mount a resistance since learning of Recon’s plans. With the support of XR Africa and others, they’ve launched an online petition and media campaign to raise awareness. A Namibian activist with a clear message for ReconAfrica. ReconAfrica is likely to use fracking to plunder more oil, potentially endangering the water supply of millions of people in a desert region. If this wasn’t bad enough, one area marked for extraction is the home of the Kalahari San, an indigeonous people already stressed by migration and the changing climate. This story is a stark example of neo-colonialism, with a Western company helping itself to a region’s resources at the expense of all life around it. Expect many more actions, and a growing international campaign, to stop the destruction. 7 - 13 December | Australia Hot off the press - Murdoch lies.

The ripples started in Melbourne’s Central Business District, where the emphasis was on exposing the planet killing lies of the Murdoch press. Rebels from XR Victoria used tripods, banners and some good old fashioned theatrics to block a major intersection. A few days later the city hosted a blockade of Victoria’s Department of Health. 4 rebels glued themselves to the entrance while a dozen more staged a ‘die-in’ outside - symbolic victims of the climate and pandemic crises. Rebels rest in peace outside Victoria’s Department of Health. Photo: Julian Meehan Melbourne’s rebellion closed with a ‘Festival of Love and Rage’. Rebels disrupted the city by land and sea, with street theatre, a flotilla of canoes on the Yarra River, a bike parade, and a roadblock. 9 festival goers were arrested for their efforts. Over in Queensland the ‘Defy Disaster’ protest managed to disrupt Brisbane’s city centre for 2 days and draw in over 250 rebels. In an effort to stop the reclaiming of the roads, police arrested 10 marchers. In Tasmania 9 rebels were arrested after a mass disruption of Hobart’s city centre to protest against ANZ, Westpac, NAB, and Commonwealth - dirty banks happy to fund fossil fuel projects.

The brutal treatment of Native Americans by white settlers throughout the 19th century, and the development of laws to disempower and manipulate indigenous populations, is a shameful episode too often omitted from American histories and origin myths. This non-fiction work by an American historian and novelist is one possible entry point to this difficult subject. Originally published in 1970, it is an account of Native American struggles against the arriving settlers, and chronicles a litany of abuses by those settlers in the name of land acquisition - including manipulation, misinformation, and massacre. Brown’s careful attention to detail illustrates the tenacious resistance of various Native American tribes, along with the insidious ways dominant powers will control the law for their own ends.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2021/01/05/citizens-assembly-climate-change/,"© Fabio De Paola PA Wire Extinction Rebellion calls for action on the climate and ecological emergency with three demands. The third demand, ‘Go Beyond Politics’, is that governments must form citizens’ assemblies and act on their recommendations. But what is a citizens’ assembly? And why does Extinction Rebellion care about them? Isn’t XR concerned with blocking roads, handing out vegan cakes and camping in trees? So many questions. Citizens’ assemblies (CAs) aim to give greater political power to citizens. Members of the public who accurately represent those living in the country make up the assembly. For example, there might be a mother of three from the east of the country, a teenaged university student from an ethnic minority group, and a retired police officer from the north. High-quality information is presented over a series of meetings, covering every angle of an issue – and every side of the argument. The group deliberates and eventually delivers its recommendations to the government. There are several things that could happen next. For example: the government is legally bound to follow the recommendations; the government studies the outcomes to inform policy; the nation votes on the citizens’ assembly’s recommendations. This process is a form of ‘deliberative democracy’. Most modern democracies limit citizens’ power to voting, but deliberative democracy requires citizens to deliberate, learn, and collaborate on decisions. It’s been gaining attention since the American professor Joseph M. Bessette wrote Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government in 1980. The beginnings of the practice of deliberative democracy, however, might be prehistoric. Athens founded the first recorded democracy around 600BCE, which favoured decisions made by a group of randomly selected citizens over appointed representatives. © Liwordson/Nappy A functioning democracy should enable voters to decide the direction in which their country moves. In theory, if citizens are not happy with this direction, they can vote for change. In practice, however, democratic governments favour solving short-term problems that ensure their popularity. Governments bury difficult, controversial, or long-term issues, such as the climate and ecological crisis. Setting up a citizens’ assembly addresses this problem: if the pressure of a citizens’ assembly is larger than the pressure of a government’s supporters and funders, action on climate change might be possible. The open discussion of this huge and complicated issue can finally happen in a constructive and fair way. Citizens’ assemblies must follow a carefully designed process. This is incredibly important, because an ineffective CA could create the impression that they’re a waste of time – it would probably be worse than not having one at all. Each CA differs depending on topic, location, and participants, but this is the rough process: Select a clear topic and question that is suitable for deliberation. Establish a media budget large enough to ensure all people in the country are aware of and engaged with the CA – this puts pressure on the government to follow the CA’s final recommendations. Select coordinators. This should be an independent organisation with experience in organising deliberative processes like citizens' assemblies. Decide on the number of citizens necessary for a fair and representative CA. Choose demographics for a representative CA. For example: Create a media strategy to ensure everyone is aware that it is happening. For example, invite journalists, create a website, create a social media presence, etc. Citizens are chosen using a random selection process, followed by a sorting process to ensure that the sample accurately represents the population as a whole (this is called 'sortition') CA begins: a. Integration stage b. Education stage c. Deliberation stage d. Recommendations stage f. Voting stage: Recommendations approved when, for example, 80% agree Publicly announce and publish results: a. Publicly list details of those in government who are responsible for action Hold regular CA reunions to maintain pressure on government. Point 2 is essential: everybody should know about the citizens’ assembly and how it has been organised, so that the public trust it. Otherwise, governments may smile, nod, and agree with a CA, then ignore its recommendations. If the nation is aware of the recommendations however, they will be harder for the government to ignore. More pressure equals more action. A big media budget can fund substantial and ongoing news coverage. A citizens’ assembly should scream and shout about its existence, so everybody’s talking about it. © Phil Hearing https://unsplash.com/photos/vGMprRUsWzo No. Extinction Rebellion also uses people’s assemblies (PAs), so it is easy to confuse the two terms. Both encourage decision-making through constructive conversation, but a people’s assembly does not have a selection process; anybody can take part. PAs also don't have a learning phase led by experts, nor detailed, critical thinking and learning at the beginning. A PA can also be much shorter than a CA, such as a day or less. For example, during an Extinction Rebellion protest with a growing police presence, a PA can answer these questions: You can answer these questions in a fair, all-inclusive way with a people’s assembly. Every PA participant states their opinion in a small group, followed by deliberation, listening, and conclusions. Each group then submits its conclusions and the assembly reaches a decision. Extinction Rebellion does not have a leadership hierarchy, so people’s assemblies are fundamental: PAs avoid top-down, undemocratic decision-making. Read more about people’s assemblies in this guide by Extinction Rebellion UK Authoritarian regimes would not tolerate a citizens’ assembly. Meanwhile, governments of many ‘democratic’ countries may commission a citizens’ assembly that is simply a public consultation, with no real decision-making power. What can we do about this? Extinction Rebellion’s Participative Democracy hub uses peoples’ assemblies to tackle these problems through a growing global network. The hub organises regular worldwide People’s Assembly Marathons (PAthons), during which a wave of PAs take place across several days. Interested politicians are invited, who may absorb the ideas that they hear from citizens. Another possible outcome is that the government will agree to a citizens’ assembly to stop growing waves of PAs.

Poland: Gdańsk Citizens’ Assemblies, 2016 onwards Canada: Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform, 2004 Ireland: The Citizens’ Assembly, 2016-2018 France: Citizen's Convention on Climate, 2019-2020 Chile’s Constitution Referendum is a thrilling example of another way to place citizens at the centre of decision-making. On 25 October 2020, 78.24% of voting Chileans demanded a new constitution for the nation. This referendum followed almost 12 months of continual, massive protests caused by the former constitution, which Augusto Pinochet (Chile’s ex-military dictator) wrote to benefit the rich and powerful. This vote also declared that a group of nominated and elected citizens will write the new constitution, which the nation will assess and vote on in mid-2022. Citizens’ assemblies are clearly growing in significance, because a global version is being planned by globalassembly.org. Conducted online, Global Assembly 2021 will involve 1000 people chosen via a lottery from around the world, taking place in the months before the UN’s Cop26 climate change conference in November 2021. This huge CA won’t have any power over governments but, if it’s managed well, the final recommendations will be difficult to ignore. © Fabio De Paola PA Wire During six weekends between January and May 2020, the city of Birmingham in England hosted Climate Assembly UK. Due to COVID-19, the final two weekends were conducted online. The assembly was requested by six ‘Select Committees’ (groups of UK Members of Parliament from various political parties) representing business and energy strategy, the environment, the treasury, housing, local government, science, technology and transport. This assembly of 110 citizens concentrated on one element of the climate and ecological crisis: *Extinction Rebellion demands net zero by 2025 Dr Alan Renwick of Constitution Unit at University College London Dr Alan Renwick was an observer at Climate Assembly UK. Dr Alan works at the Constitution Unit at University College London and is an expert on deliberative democracy. The weekend started on Friday evening with people gathering. There was a sense of a group coming together and engaging in a collective task, which is important to build up during a citizens’ assembly. They had various talks from Friday evening and throughout Saturday. They started with material coming from the front of the room. A lot of the time was spent with the members discussing their thoughts, listening to each other, and hearing very different perspectives in the room. Then they relaxed over dinner and did it all again on Sunday. The feeling in the room was that it was an amazing opportunity to hear from top experts, and that citizens were being listened to by senior decision-makers. One of the first people they heard from was David Attenborough, who said “you have this amazing task and it’s really important that you do it well”. It is important with a citizens’ assembly that you get the full range of opinions, otherwise policymakers won’t take it seriously. There were people who have a very sceptical view of climate change or don’t think it’s a very high priority, and there were people for whom it was the top priority. But I didn’t notice any clashing; I noticed people listening to each other and respecting each other. Watch Dr Renwick talking to Climate Assembly UK participants Climate Assembly UK was not big news: not enough UK citizens knew that it was happening, which is essential if a CA is to create significant change. This viewpoint is echoed by research group Carnegie Europe, which compared 2020’s French and British CAs on climate change. Its report stated that ‘despite some national press coverage of the UK assembly, the CAUK was never designed to create a genuine national debate, and it didn’t.’ This may be partially due to Climate Assembly UK’s budget, which was 672,139 USD. By comparison, the budget of the Citizen's Convention on Climate in France was 6.34m USD and ‘seven out of ten French people had heard about the convention’s proposals’, according to a Réseau Action Climat France poll. _The UK government does not have to follow the recommendations of Climate Assembly UK. Instead, the six select committees [‘will use [the recommendations] as a basis for detailed work on implementing the assembly’s recommendations, which will also be debated in the House of Commons’](https://www.climateassembly.uk/about/). Climate Assembly UK published its recommendations on 10 September 2020. It is not yet clear if this report will lead to significant action in the country, but without mass public pressure, it will be relatively easy for the government to ignore. There is no set pathway for what to do after a CA. Should the decisions made during the assembly be immediately acted upon? Should they be voted on by the public, or perhaps the government? Should they only be advisory? We asked Dr Renwick for his opinion: There is disagreement between democratic theorists, but I think it’s important that decisions are made by those who are accountable to voters: politicians. If you are not giving all voters the chance to hold to account the people who made a decision, it could lead to unhappiness in the wider electorate. I think setting up a citizens’ assembly helps politicians make difficult decisions. It enables politicians to say: I know this is really tough, but the citizens’ assembly looked at this issue in depth and concluded this is the best thing for the country. Extinction Rebellion recognises that governments will not independently take bold action on the climate and ecological crisis, because they have already failed to do so for decades. Therefore, it is essential that CAs have a clear route to action, as well as large media budgets, in order to generate support, engagement and trust among the general public. For example, the route to action following France’s Citizens' Convention on Climate is clear: or © Andrew Mercer (www.baldwhiteguy.co.nz) - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=92110716 Our current political systems are not capable of delivering the necessary solutions to the climate and ecological crisis. While voting is important, this crisis demands more from us than ‘yes’ or ‘no’. How should a nation quickly move away from fossil fuels? Where should wildlife sanctuaries be reintroduced and how? Such large, long-term questions demand deliberation and input from all of us. Well-funded, widely publicised citizens’ assemblies with clear routes to action will answer these questions. “It is the ambition of every government to remain in power. This ambition has, in the past, limited government’s appetite to take bold and decisive action on policies which might prove too hard or unpopular with the electorate. This can no longer be the case.” (Climate Assembly UK) Extinction Rebellion UK published a guide to citizens’ assemblies in 2019, which you can download at xrcitizensassembly.uk.

Without leadership, citizens, corporations and institutions lack direction and purpose in the fight against this climatic and ecological nightmare that worsens with every passing day. This leaves all of us - and the planet we call home - in a desperate and dangerous position. That is why “Tell the Truth” is the first of Extinction Rebellion’s three core demands. We demand that governments everywhere tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with the public, businesses and other institutions to communicate this urgent need for change. There is widespread consensus across the scientific community that rapidly changing climates and ecological collapse are not tomorrow’s problems: we are living them today. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that urgent action must be taken to keep the rise in global temperatures below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The panel outlined how a failure to achieve this benchmark will lead to catastrophic consequences for the global economy, and have a devastating impact on communities and ecosystems across the world. They also confirmed that increasingly extreme weather patterns, rising sea levels and melting arctic ice are the direct consequence of the 1°C of global warming created by humans since the start of the industrial age. In April 2020, the IPCC found that global temperatures are already on course to reach 1.5°C of warming between 2030 and 2052: a reality that would bring with it “dramatic damage”. This would rapidly accelerate the crisis as melting arctic ice releases trillions of tons of harmful gases into the atmosphere, further accelerating warming and its deadly consequences. More alarmingly still, our current rate of global emissions put us on the path to 3-4C of warming in just 80 years time. Not only this, but global heating, along with habitat destruction, overconsumption and pollution are already feeding into the second harbinger of planetary disaster: a crash in global biodiversity. In fact, several studies have suggested that we are now entering the Earth’s Sixth Mass Extinction event. The earth has experienced five of these events in the past 540 million years or so, and in each more than three-quarters of all species became extinct in a geological blink-of-an-eye. This time, the rate of extinction is unprecedented: occurring at a rate 100 to 1,000 times faster than has occurred in the past. The Bingley Floods, Bradford, UK, 2015. Photo: Chris Gallagher, Unsplash. When we speak about one, two, three, or four degrees of warming, it is easy to see such small numbers and dismiss the extent of the damage and disruption they mean for us, our families and friends, fellow humans and collective way of life. This failure of imagination says nothing about what awaits us if we fail to act. Scientists predict that life on earth will change beyond recognition on a warming planet. In a world that is just 2C hotter, scientists found: (According to an analysis of 70 peer-reviewed studies by Carbon Brief.) More than this, the United Nations and World Bank predict that there will be between 140 and 200 million climate refugees by 2050 as continued warming leads to increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters. The results of the ecological crisis are just as grave for us and our planet. Countries are exploiting the planet’s natural resources at a pace greater than its ability to regenerate. If this continues, not only will we lose our natural wonders, but our planet will no longer be able to sustain the global economy and our quality of life in the decades ahead. From the loss of insects to pollinate our crops, to the collapse of fish populations that feed billions of people globally, life as we know it will become significantly more vulnerable and volatile in the coming years without action to stave off further biodiversity loss. As Sir David Attenborough, renowned British naturalist explains: “ This isn’t just about losing wonders of nature. With the loss of even the smallest organisms, we destabilise and ultimately risk collapsing the world’s ecosystems – the networks that support the whole of life on Earth. Sir Robert Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, explains the threat similarly: The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide. This truth must be told and we must take action to avoid a series of irreversible tipping points that will permanently destabilise life on earth as we know it. Photo: Micaela Parente, Unsplash. Despite clear evidence of the climate and ecological crisis, governments are falling woefully short at addressing it. Their lies to themselves, and to us, about all of this, represent one of the biggest obstacles to saving people like you and I from a terrifying new reality. The 2015 Paris Agreement committed participating countries to curb and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep global temperature rises “well below” 2°C since the pre-industrial era. Yet a majority of world governments are failing to meet even these inadequate targets. Instead, they actively ignore both the present and potential impact of climate change and the ecological crisis, or propose policies which downplay the seriousness of the situation. Our governments continue to support businesses who cling to a destructive business-as-usual-profit-at-any-cost suicide mission. Inaction on climate change continues despite repeated, evidence-based warnings from scientists, beginning more than 40 years ago at the First World Climate Change Conference in 1979 and continuing at other international meetings since then - including the 1992 Rio Summit, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement. Here is a brief look at some of the major players on the international stage, as of September 2020, according to the Climate Action Tracker-an independent scientific organisation that measures actual government action against the 2015 globally agreed aim of halting warming below 1.5°C. The USA’s mitigation efforts are rated “critically insufficient” as it is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, scrapping the Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs) that formed the basis of their promise to act. China’s climate actions are rated “highly insufficient”, based on its commitment of having 10% gas and 20% non-fossil fuels in its primary energy mix by 2030. Chinese government pledges fall well short of what is needed to keep warming below 2°C, let alone limiting it to 1.5°C as required under the Paris Agreement, and put it on the path for 3-4°C of warming beyond 2030. Note: As the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, accounting for approximately 27% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, China’s actions both at home and abroad have an enormous impact on global GHG emissions. The UK government’s current 2030 target of a 57 per cent reduction in GHG emissions below 1990 levels is rated as ‘insufficient’ for limiting warming to below 1.5°C. Germany’s 55% emissions reduction target for 2030 is rated “highly insufficient” and in desperate need of strengthening if it is to be compatible with the Paris Agreement. Russia’s climate commitment is rated “critically insufficient”, as it is consistent with a warming of over 4°C. This means Russia’s NDCs cannot be seen as a genuine attempt to keep warming below 2°C, let alone the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Note: Russia is the fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world — after China, the U.S. and India. Moreover, its per capita emissions are among the highest in the world — 53% higher than China and 79% higher than the EU, though 25% lower than the U.S. Brazil’s NDC for 2025 and 2030 is rated “insufficient” and inconsistent with keeping warming to 1.5°C as required under the Paris Agreement, and is instead consistent with warming between 2°C and 3°C. India’s climate policies are rated “2°C compatible” by Climate Action Tracker, indicating that their climate commitment for 2030 is within the range of what is considered to be a fair share of the global effort, though still well short of what was agreed in Paris in 2015. Australia’s NDC for 2030 is also rated as “insufficient”, indicating that the commitment made in 2017 is not consistent with holding warming to below 2°C, let alone limiting it to 1.5°C as required under the Paris Agreement, and is instead consistent with warming between 2°C and 3°C. (Visit climateactiontracker.org for the latest updates). When it comes to the ecological crisis, the world has not met even one of the targets set in 2010 to slow damage to the natural world, according to the United Nations. In fact, governments have missed all of their targets for two decades. In the meantime, the warnings about the threat to biodiversity only grow starker. The World Wildlife Fund recently disclosed that 21,000 animal populations have declined by almost 70 per cent since 1970. “Catastrophic impacts for people and planet loom closer than ever,” the WWF warns. The IPBES Global Assessment, meanwhile, estimates one million animal and plant species are threatened with going extinct due to human action in coming years. Extinction Rebellion protester, London, September 2020. Photo: Ehimetalor Akhere Unuabona, Unsplash. Governments have delayed long enough. The advanced state of the twin crises unfolding today is proof that such empty rhetoric is simply not enough to even begin to address the situation we find ourselves in. Worst case scenarios are now only avoidable if governments tell the truth about the climate and ecological crisis and act now. Too many lies have been told for too long. It is only by telling the truth that we can begin to achieve urgently needed action on both the national and international stages. This is why ‘Tell the Truth’ is the first of XR’s three core demands.

Dear rebels, Governments are pledging to avert a climate crisis while their economies bankroll and intensify it. Production of coal, oil, and gas must fall right now to keep global heating under 1.5C. Yet a new UN backed report shows how governments across the world are planning to increase production, while giving much more Covid-recovery money to fossil fuels than clean energy. And it’s not just public money that is fuelling the climate crisis. A startling new report by the Rainforest Action Network shows how 35 top private banks have invested an eye-watering $2.7 trillion in fossil fuels since the Paris agreement was adopted five years ago. And those investments are increasing year on year. In this special issue on money, we highlight two battles between small bands of rebels and big bad banks. The State Bank of India, a bank majority-owned by the Indian Government, wants to loan $1billion to fast track a coal mega-mine in Western Australia, while Standard Bank in South Africa is funding a 1,445km heated crude oil pipeline that will devastate East Africa’s ecology. A rebel pickets Standard Bank’s offices in Johannesburg. Photo: Zoe Postman We also introduce an exciting new campaign to challenge the global banking system and its suicidal investment strategies.

Photo: PTI Rebels and other activists across India have staged protests outside branches of the State Bank of India (SBI). Some rebels have escalated actions by taking part in ‘ATM jams’ where SBI cash machines have truth-telling flyers super-glued over their screens and card slots blocked. The SBI, which is majority owned by the Indian government, is planning to loan Adani, a vast Indian conglomerate that focuses on energy and transport, $678 million to help open its coal mega-mine in northern Australia. SBI had planned to give Adani $1billion for the coal mine in 2014, before controversy over the project, and accusations of crony capitalism made the bank back away. Activists protest outside an SBI branch in Pune As well as adding 4.6 billion tonnes of carbon to our atmosphere, Adani’s Carmichael coal mine will increase ship traffic by the Great Barrier reef, risk local aquifers, and destroy ancestral lands. Adani has been a long-time supporter of India’s PM and is one of a handful of conglomerates which are gobbling up contracts and profits as India undergoes a major privatisation drive. A protester in the Sydney Cricket Ground during a match between India & Australia. Photo: AP Hundreds of thousands of Punjabi farmers marched to the Indian capital New Delhi last month in protest at 3 new bills that open up Indian agriculture to private investment, and Adani is a likely benefactor. The company already dominates India’s food transport sector, runs a quarter of India’s shipping ports, and owns 6 newly privatised airports. The 3 bills, rushed through parliament in the summer, will deregulate food crop markets and remove government-sanctioned minimum pricing. Farmers believe this will lead to corporate takeovers of their small farms and a crash in prices. Police used tear gas, water cannon, trucks weighed down with sand, barbed wire and trenches, but failed to stop the farmers entering the city. A police request to convert 9 sports stadiums into jails was thankfully rejected by the city council. Meetings between farmer union and government representatives are ongoing. Police try to disperse farmers protesting on the edge of New Delhi. Photo: PTI 13 November | Johannesburg, South Africa South African rebels demanded that Standard Bank ditch its funding for the world’s largest heated oil pipeline. The East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline will traverse the renowned Murchison Falls National Park. As well as displacing indigenous communities and threatening endangered species, it will pump thousands of litres of crude oil a day - a disaster for people, biodiversity and the climate crisis. Photo: Anita Rebels gathered at Standard Bank’s offices in Johannesburg, carrying placards that read “we are watching you” and “inaction is a weapon of mass destruction”. They poured treacle over forecourt flagstones then used it to leave handprints on the office walls, a symbolic act to show how the bank has prioritised dirty oil over lives and livelihoods. In the midst of this peaceful protest, the rebels were seized by security and led away with their hands in the air.

November | Sri Lanka 13 environmental groups, including XR Sri Lanka, are fighting to protect vast regions of the nation’s rainforest from a corporate land grab. The threatened area spans 7% of the island’s total landmass. Sri Lanka’s President promised to double the country’s forest cover before his election, yet his government has abolished legal protections for 700,000 hectares of Other State Forests (OSF). These unofficial forests, not formally recognised in Sri Lankan law, were once protected by the national Forest Department. But now a new law has handed them back to local government officials for ‘economic development’. Bureaucratic misuse and rapid deforestation is expected. Among the OSFs are rare Cloud Forests which make up less than 1% of global woodland. Losing them would drive many endangered and endemic plants and animals to extinction, not to mention the loss of yet more valuable carbon sinks. The move is believed to be the result of corporate lobbying (67% of Sri Lankan land is state owned). Global fruit and vegetable company Dole Lanka was recently able to acquire large tracts of land for banana and mango plantations that was earmarked as a new reserve in Lunugamvehera National Park. Wildlife and Forest Field Officers within Mahaweli Flood Plains National Park have also suffered verbal abuse from the very State Minister they work for. XR Sri Lanka are planning an upcoming Reforest Rebellion, where Rainforest Protectors will plant hundreds of saplings in Sinharaja Forest Reserve.

Some regions are still experiencing severe flooding, with waters reaching depths of up to 12m. Media coverage and local relief efforts have been hampered by both the pandemic and the current government. The Philippines is no stranger to typhoons, with the country experiencing 20 in the past year. But as global temperatures rise, typhoons and storm surges will become even more frequent. For the Philippino people on the front line of the climate crisis, the investment portfolios of global banks, and the reluctance of governments to bring them to heel, are matters of life and death.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/12/04/conversation-with-climate-sceptic/,"It took me a long time to fully realise the truth about climate change. Up until a few years ago, I had somehow failed to recognise that approximately 97% of scientists agree that the earth is warming and that humans are to blame. Image by Josep Castells from Unsplash For over 30 years, the science has been clear on climate change. So how is it possible that I and many others are just waking up to the fact that it is a very real danger? Perhaps it is as Greta Thunberg says: At first when I heard about climate change, I was a climate denier. I didn’t think it was happening. Because if there really was an existential crisis like that, that would threaten our civilisation, we wouldn’t be focusing on anything else. While it may be unbelievable to you that climate-change sceptics still exist in the year 2020, it’s not all that surprising, given the reasons we’ll go into below. If you have a friend or family member that still scoffs at the science, then I first ask you to be compassionate rather than judgemental. By following the steps below, with any luck you might turn that climate-change denier into a climate-change activist! In today’s world, access to the internet can make it seem like we have all of the planet’s information at our fingertips. However, filtering out the fact from the fiction can be a challenge in itself! Not only are a million different messages thrown at us on a daily basis telling us that we should care/get angry about a variety of things — there are also people out there who are deliberately trying to mislead us. Here are some reasons why people might believe that climate change is fake: The media often frames climate change as a ‘debate’, which suggests that many experts around the world continue to disagree on the science. A misleading amount of airtime is given to climate-change sceptics and their ideas, in a bid to frame climate change as an ongoing dispute. Image by Priscilla du Preez from Unsplash The fossil fuel industry is actively funding climate-change denial using the very same strategies (and strategists) that were once used to defend the tobacco industry. Over the years, environmental activists have been portrayed as jobless hippies who don’t have a practical grip on reality or understand what it takes to run a successful economy. There’s been a particular push by certain newspapers/companies to portray climate activists today as ‘dreamers’ and ‘idealists’ — people that we shouldn’t take too seriously. Image by Stephen Arnold from Unsplash Many people are just trying to survive on a day-to-day basis; to pay their bills and put food on the table. They may not have paid too much attention to climate-change science. Finally, nobody wants to be shamed, or to feel that their lifestyle is being blamed for climate change, especially when this comes from folks who are in a better financial position than they are. People who are struggling already don’t want to be told that they must cut out meat, cycle to work, have shorter showers, and not have that barbecue on the weekend. Life is already tough enough and they have their own problems to think about, without adding guilt about the destruction of the planet to the mix. This is why we argue for systemic change rather than individual change at Extinction Rebellion. As climate essayist Mary Annaise Heglar argues: ‘the belief that this enormous, existential problem could have been fixed if all of us had just tweaked our consumptive habits is not only preposterous; it’s dangerous.’ Before we look at some of the arguments that climate-change deniers might raise to you, here are four tips on how to have a rewarding conversation about climate change: Now, let’s get down to the nitty-gritty of the conversation and look at five things that your friend or family member might say to you if they are sceptical about climate change: Begin by agreeing with them. Yes, the climate of the Earth has changed over the course of history and nobody is denying that. Variation in the proximity of the earth to the sun due to slight shifts in the planet’s orbit, volcanic eruptions, and the natural release of gases such as methane, all have had an effect on the climate and have been the cause of both significantly cooler and warmer periods on Earth. Image by Hamzah Hanafi from Unsplash However, the difference this time is the rate of change since the second half of the 20th century, which is unprecedented in at least the past 2,000 years. And, if we stay on the current course, the earth risks reaching temperatures that the planet has not experienced in millions of years. At the same time, the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere has reached unparalleled levels, increasing year-on-year since continuous records began in 1958 (currently around 410 parts per million). Following careful research and thousands of peer-reviewed studies, scientists today almost universally agree that the faster warming of the planet is caused by the pumping of heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which has increased immensely since the industrial revolution. Scientists estimate that the last time that the level of carbon dioxide was over 400 parts per million was during the Pliocene Epoch, some millions of years ago, when the temperature of the earth was 2–3 degrees warmer, seas were at least 10 metres higher (a level that would now submerge major cities around the world) and horses and camels lived in the high Arctic. It is not a question of whether or not the actual earth will survive climate change, but of whether or not it will stay habitable for the human and other species, not to mention for our way of life. It can be even more difficult to convince someone that climate change is real when it’s snowing outside and you’re both wearing scarves and hats! However, the most important thing to remember here is that weather is not climate. While weather describes the day-to-day changes in rain or snow, wind and temperature, climate is the average weather pattern of a particular region over a long period. Image by Amin Hasani from Unsplash President Donald Trump recently fell victim to this, two American winters ago… In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Warming? Please come back fast, we need you! Did you know that as the average global temperatures gradually rise, harsher winters, unusually cold temperatures, storms, and blizzards are actually expected in some areas? A study published in 2017 in the journal Nature Geoscience found a link between warmer Arctic temperatures and colder North American winters. Humans can find it difficult to look at the bigger picture, so that’s where NASA comes in handy! Even if temperatures seem to cool off for a few years, looking at a short-term weather trend can be misleading Video by NASA/JPL-Caltech from here In a nutshell, climate change means climate disruption. One study, published in Science Advances, suggests that extreme deadly weather events could ‘increase by as much as 50% by the year 2100.’ For the past 50 years, climate change has been treated by politicians and the media as a distant problem for future generations to solve. There has been no sense of emergency in tackling the crisis, despite the increasingly urgent warnings from scientists. So, when Extinction Rebellion first began to sound the alarm bells on climate change in 2018, many people thought that they were being overly dramatic and alarmist. Image by Josh Hild from Unsplash The truth is that climate change (with its environmental destruction) poses a threat to all of us, not in some faraway future, but now. Depending on where we live, we may not all be in danger of dying from extreme temperatures or having our houses submerged in floodwater. However, the effects of climate change and the ecological crisis will undoubtedly have a negative effect on our lives and the lives of our children. (Read this article to discover how climate change is linked to the rise in deadly pandemics.) So, if a friend or family member dismisses your concerns about climate change as something that ‘we don’t need to worry about now’ or that ‘future generations will invent the technology to solve’, they are gravely mistaken. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that we only have 10 years left to cut carbon emissions enough to limit the effects of a climate catastrophe. After that time, many of the effects of climate change will be irreversible. This is why Extinction Rebellion demands that governments across the world cut carbon emissions to zero by the year 2025 rather than 2050. In the 1970s, a handful of scientists got coverage in the media for saying that the world was heading for an ice age. However, a survey of peer-reviewed articles from this period found that only seven studies predicted climate cooling. Even at the same time, significantly more papers (42 in total) actually predicted global warming, but the newspapers decided not to print that. Image by Miguel Mansilla from Unsplash We don’t really know the reason why a few journalists decided to cherry-pick and sensationalise these inaccurate ‘global cooling’ studies. Perhaps back in the 1970s, a pending ice age sounded more dramatic and shocking, and would therefore sell more newspapers. Who knows? However, what is important here is that in the 1970s ‘scientists’ referred to a small group of researchers whose speculations were repeated by a small group of journalists. As Eoin O'Carroll points out, however, today, scientists ‘refers to every single major scientific body in the world. There’s just no valid comparison.’ So, if your climate-denying friend comes out with this statement, then, before you tell them that they are wrong, first ask them if they know anything about the ‘scientists’ that predicted this ‘global cooling’ 50 years ago. The media often play tricks on us when they announce that ‘scientists say x’ or ‘scientists say y’, but, as consumers of information, we must always look more closely at who exactly are the ‘scientists’ that are being referred to. The ‘false choice’ fallacy is one way in which corporations or the media try to manipulate people into believing what they want them to believe. They will often put forward two different arguments which are seemingly opposed, and suggest that people have to decide, morally, which side they’re on. Upon closer examination, however, you will see that it is not an ‘either–or’ choice at all. When it comes to climate change, the false choice is ‘saving the planet’ vs. ‘saving the economy’ — i.e. people’s jobs and livelihoods. For example, President Trump has stated that the Paris Agreement would be ‘totally disastrous, job-killing, wealth-knocking out.’ ""We announced our withdrawal from the totally disastrous, job-killing, wealth-knocking out, you know it knocked out our wealth or it would have. They basically wanted to take our wealth away. They didn't want us to use our wealth power."" @realdonaldtrump on #ParisClimateAccord pic.twitter.com/BgJugzL5Ws The reality is, however, that ‘there are no jobs on a dead planet’ as Ian Hodson, President of the Bakers’, Food and Allied Workers Union so succinctly put it. Our global economy is tied to our food systems, which are strongly tied to the climate. Everything is connected in a complex adaptive system, and if we fail in our attempts to slow climate change, the whole thing may come crashing down with unthinkable damage to our societies. We cannot save jobs and peoples’ livelihoods without saving the planet. The two are inseparable. In fact, however, while climate action will mean that people who work in carbon-heavy industries such as oil and coal mining may lose their jobs, even more jobs in clean energy can be created. Image by Remy Gieling from Unsplash People will have to retrain, businesses will have to adapt and our failing systems will need to change. The shift to a green economy will take some adjusting to and will not be without its challenges. But what is the alternative? Do we stick to ‘business as usual’? Do we keep spiralling downwards into the abyss, with the knowledge that we are creating much, much worse problems for generations to come? If you still haven’t been able to convince your friend or family member of the truth about climate change, then you only have one tool left in your arsenal. Pose the question: ‘What if the experts are wrong about climate change and it is fake after all? What if we go to all this trouble to try to change things for no good reason?’ With this technique, your friend or family member is forced to consider the possible consequences of behaving as if climate change is real, as opposed to behaving as if it were fake. On the one hand, if we act as if climate change is real and do everything in our power to stop it, in the worst-case scenario, we get a healthier, less polluted planet with greener cities, more parks, fewer cars, cleaner rivers and seas. We end up switching to renewable forms of energy that won’t run out. We stop producing useless disposable objects that are created solely to keep the wheels of industry turning. And, we all get to breathe fresher air! On the other hand, if we act like climate change is fake and continue life ‘as normal’, we run the risk of having to one day look our grandchildren in the eye and admit that we fundamentally failed them. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/22/ten-years-save-planet/,"If we want to avoid a whole range of increasingly severe impacts from climate change, we need to restrict global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is the message from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). What they say really matters, as they’re widely seen as the number one global authority on the subject. The starting point that’s normally used when talking about global warming is the ‘pre-industrial baseline’. This baseline relies on the average temperatures between 1850 and 1900. Whilst this isn’t strictly speaking pre-industrial, this period is used because we still have reliable temperature records for it. Only a very small proportion of emissions generated by humans occurred before 1850, so it can provide a good basis for judging the general impact of emissions created by human activity. The trouble is, we’re already at 1.1°C above this baseline. Without urgent action we’ll pass 1.5°C in around 20 years. This would have catastrophic impacts for our planet, such as more extreme weather, loss of habitats and the species living within them, which could threaten our food and water supplies. Preventing this requires much more action, and this needs to happen right now. Image by PIRO4D from Pixabay The problem is, it’s not like turning off a tap. Even if we manage to reduce all our emissions to zero today, the pollutants that are already in the atmosphere will continue to produce further warming. Carbon dioxide can remain in the Earth’s atmosphere for thousands of years, so our historic emissions will have an ongoing impact. The IPCC’s 2018 Report maintained that limiting warming to 1.5°C above the baseline was still possible. But since then we’ve already moved from 1.0°C to 1.1°C, and with each passing day the likelihood of limiting the warming reduces further. The MCC think tank’s Carbon Clock provides a shocking indication of how little time remains before carbon emissions make warming of 1.5°C or 2.0°C unavoidable. Their estimates suggest that in just over seven years total global emissions are going to reach the level that will produce 1.5°C of warming. They’re not saying we’ll reach 1.5°C at this point, but that the total emissions in the atmosphere would mean that this increase is ‘locked in’ and inevitable. The time lag between emissions and the warming they generate is why the IPCC is talking about reaching 1.5°C in 20 years rather than seven. Sadly, in terms of keeping global warming below 1.5°C, the answer is yes. Unless we move extremely quickly, our actions will only be shaping how far beyond 1.5°C we ultimately end up. Our focus needs to be on damage limitation, as many negative impacts of global warming are already happening and can no longer be avoided. Whether it’s extreme heatwaves, droughts and wildfires affecting many places, or increasingly violent storms and flooding — rising global temperatures are influencing the frequency and severity of climate disruption events. Even if national governments meet all their existing pledges to reduce emissions, we’re heading for warming of over 3°C by 2100. However, considering historic failures to curb emissions, the increase by the end of the century could be even greater. A 3°C temperature change may not seem like a big deal, as it’s something many of us experience on a daily basis. However, a global average temperature increase of this amount will have a devastating impact on ecosystems and our food and water supplies. The predicted consequences are so severe and far-reaching, that for many of us they would result in fundamental changes to our lives. We can’t change the past, but we can change the present and the resulting future. The sooner we act, the less severe the future consequences will be. If you turned the heating in your home up by one degree, the temperature difference might be unnoticeable to you. Unfortunately, the impact of small changes on the natural world can be much more serious. For example, scientific research suggests that with a 1.5°C level of warming we’ll lose between 70 and 90% of coral reefs, but with 2°C we’ll lose almost all of them (99%). Another key point is that, unlike home heating, you can’t just turn the temperature back down again. Whilst existing carbon capture and storage technology has potential for reducing emissions, it isn’t going to remove all of the carbon that we’ve already emitted from the atmosphere. The more that temperatures increase, the greater the risk of feedback loops becoming established. These could result in further temperature rises, which we would no longer be able to stop. One example of a feedback loop is the increased warming resulting from the melting of sea ice. Because of their colour, snow and ice absorb less heat than the sea. As temperatures rise, sea ice melts and more sea is uncovered. The sea can then absorb more heat, which accelerates the warming process. This is often referred to as the albedo effect. Image by Taken from Pixabay Another example is emissions from thawing permafrost. Permafrost is a term used to describe ground that remains frozen for more than two years. In many cases it’s ground that would, under normal circumstances, remain permanently frozen. As temperatures rise, increasing amounts of permafrost are thawing. This results in more carbon and methane being released into the atmosphere, which adds to the greenhouse effect, producing further warming. Methane is a particular concern, as it has a far worse potential impact than carbon dioxide on global warming, particularly in the short term. Scientists are doing their best to model the impact of feedback loops such as these, that we have become aware of. However, as we move into completely uncharted territory climate-wise, there may be others that we have never experienced or even foreseen. Rock climbers usually take the precaution of investing in and using ropes and other safety equipment. They don’t do this because they know exactly when and how they’ll fall off a cliff; it’s because they know that in the event they fall, they’re very likely to be killed or seriously injured without it. They take action to prevent this outcome, even though there’s uncertainty over the exact timing and nature of a potential fall. The climate and ecological emergency has been described as an existential threat to humanity, and huge numbers of other living things are similarly endangered. The severity of the worst consequences means our response needs to be guided by what is known as the precautionary principle. That is, 'in the case of serious or irreversible threats to the health of humans or the ecosystem, acknowledged scientific uncertainty should not be used as a reason to postpone preventative measures’. Essentially, the precautionary principle is based on the adage that it’s better to be safe than sorry. It can be difficult to predict with high levels of confidence exactly when ‘tipping points’ resulting in the creation of irreversible feedback loops might occur. However, the consequences of failing to act are potentially so severe that ignoring the precautionary principle is extremely hard to justify. Depending on where you live, a milder climate may even seem like quite an attractive idea. However, as temperatures rise, increasing numbers of people are being exposed to potentially deadly heat. High temperatures pose the greatest risk to the most vulnerable members of our communities such as babies, the elderly and people with health issues such as heart and lung conditions or diabetes. And even if rising temperatures don’t present an immediate health risk to us, they can impact us in many other ways such as food and water shortages, wildfires and rising sea levels. This isn’t something that will happen in the future - it’s happening right now. Many people are already experiencing suffering linked to the climate and ecological emergency. During 2020 we’ve witnessed unprecedented wildfires in both the USA and Australia and severe flooding in numerous locations, including China and Central and Eastern Africa. Image by Skeeze from Pixabay The impacts of climate change will not, however, be felt equally across the globe. In many cases, those who have contributed least to global emissions are the ones who will suffer (and are already suffering) the worst consequences. The severity of the impacts and our ability to protect ourselves from them will vary, but we will all be affected. Some of the ways in which the climate and ecological emergency will impact us are: Approximately 820 million people already don’t have enough to eat, and the climate and ecological emergency is increasing this number. Yields of staple crops such as wheat are already being harmed by changing weather patterns. As the incidence of extreme weather such as droughts and flooding increases, harvests of many crops will become less reliable or may be destroyed completely. Human actions, such as the excessive demands we're placing on our oceans, are combining with climate change to create an increasingly precarious food supply situation. Our use of harmful chemicals and destruction of habitats is resulting in the loss of pollinators, such as bees, that around 75% of global food crops rely on to some extent. Even if your own country is less badly affected than others, you may find it becoming unable to import food it needs, or it no longer having surpluses to export to other countries. Those of us fortunate enough to avoid the predicted famines may still experience reduced choice and higher prices. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided graphic illustrations of the fragility of food supply chains. 'Emergency on Planet Earth', written by Dr. Emily Grossman of XR Scientists, highlights some of the ways in which our water supplies will be affected. Almost half of the world’s population (3.6 billion people) currently lives in areas that are potentially water-scarce at least one month per year. By 2050, this number could increase to between 4.8 billion and 5.7 billion. As mountain glaciers melt, the 1.9 billion people downstream face reduced access to water for drinking, sanitation, crop irrigation, power generation and other uses. It’s estimated that by 2030 global demand for freshwater will exceed supply by 40%. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of droughts in many places including Africa and Australia and contributed to a megadrought in the western United States. In 2018, Cape Town came within days of turning off its water supply. Climate scientists estimate that this drought has already gone from a ‘once every 300 years’ event to a ‘once every 100 years’ event. At 2°C of heating, the estimated frequency would be once every 33 years. Image by Jose Antonio Alba from Pixabay A recent study of hundreds of extreme weather events suggested that more than two thirds had been made more likely or more severe by climate change. Increases in flooding, storms and wildfires are causing disruption, economic damage and taking lives. It’s not just humans that are suffering the consequences of extreme weather - the unprecedented Australian bushfires that took place in late 2019 and early 2020 are estimated to have killed or displaced almost 3 billion animals. Many people already experience life-threatening temperatures, and as the planet warms, increasing numbers will face this danger. The 2015 heatwaves in India and Pakistan that killed over 3,400 people could happen annually. This year, Europe has once again seen heatwaves, with temperature records being broken in a number of countries. The IPCC warns that an increase of 2°C (rather than 1.5°) could result in 420 million more people being frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves. Warmer air and warmer seas result in more water vapour in the atmosphere. This additional vapour is expected to result in heavier and more frequent rain. Thus, whilst some parts of the world suffer increasing water shortages as a result of climate change, others will experience more storms and floods. Rising sea levels, flooding, intolerable temperatures and food and water shortages are expected to result in people being displaced from their homes on a scale never witnessed in human history. A recent report estimated that by 2050 as many as 1.2 billion people could be displaced. Projected sea-level rises mean that, by 2050, land which is currently home to 300 million people will be likely to flood every year. This will particularly affect parts of Asia, with cities in China, Bangladesh and India containing the largest numbers of people at risk. Countries fortunate enough to escape the worst impacts of climate change are likely to face unprecedented challenges in providing food, shelter and healthcare for all of those displaced. Current numbers of climate refugees are tiny compared to future projections, yet we’re already witnessing significant political tensions and resistance to opening borders. This isn’t something that can be predicted with the same level of certainty as melting ice. However, climate change is producing additional tensions which make conflict more likely. History provides warnings of how fearful populations can provide fertile ground for authoritarianism and nationalism. When the national interests of countries come increasingly into conflict, the danger of war increases. Image by Robert Waghorn from Pixabay Most of us have witnessed examples of people fighting over things when there isn’t enough for everyone, or when they feel that others have taken more than their fair share. In recent months we’ve seen tempers fraying around the world as a result of empty supermarket shelves. As food, water and habitable land become less available, the danger of this being replicated on a much larger scale will grow. In combination, the impacts of the climate and ecological emergency present a real danger to our societies. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how quickly the things that many of us may take for granted can be lost. Food shortages are one of the biggest concerns, because they may happen very quickly. There are warnings about the increasing risk of a ‘multiple breadbasket failure’, where harvests of key crops such as wheat are badly affected in a number of locations simultaneously. Maintaining order and social cohesion becomes increasingly difficult when people don’t have enough to eat. Extreme weather events are likely to bring increased disruption to many of our lives. Infrastructure such as roads, railways and power networks may be damaged or destroyed. Emergency services risk being unable to meet increasing demand and safety nets such as insurance systems could become unviable. Whilst some mitigation and adaptation may be possible, the predicted scale and frequency of climate related disruption will make this increasingly difficult and costly. Even if we escape the total societal collapse that some predict, our way of life may well be disrupted to the extent that what we currently consider normal ceases to exist. Image by PublicDomainPictures from Pixabay When people talk about ten years to save the planet, it isn’t generally based on an expectation that the world will end in 2030. It’s based on the premise that if we don’t take real meaningful action within the next decade, then some of the most catastrophic projected impacts of climate change will become impossible to avoid. Without significant emission reductions in the next five years, limiting warming to 1.5C will no longer be a realistic possibility. Failure to act now increases the risk that unstoppable feedback loops become established. These may then continue to accelerate global warming, even if we succeed in reducing our emissions. If we fail to take drastic action in the next ten years, our ability to avert catastrophic ecological breakdown will be massively reduced. Extinction Rebellion is demanding that governments tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency and take immediate action to reduce emissions and halt the loss of biodiversity.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/21/jimmy-piaguaje-interview/,"This interview was first published on Writers Rebel. Jimmy Piaguaje in traditional dress. Photo: Ribaldo Piaguaje Jimmy Piaguaje is a young indigenous Siekopai defender from Siekoya Remolino, a community of 53 families living on the banks of the Aguarico River in the northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon region. The Siekopai (which means multicoloured people) are renowned for their shamanic acumen and knowledge of medicinal plants, with uses for over 1,000 different plants. According to the Siekopai origin story, the god Ñañëpaina came down from the sky to find their people living underground and liberated them to live on the earth. Their language is called Paai koka. The Siekopai wear crowns and arm bands made of leaves and flowers and paint their bodies and faces with geometric designs. Also known as the Secoya, they are renowned for their excellent hot sauce, made from jungle peppers, and for drinking yoko (a coffee-like drink made from a vine). The Siekopai are an endangered people defending a fragile ecosystem upon which we all depend: the Amazon rainforest. Historically, the Siekopai numbered over 30,000 and had an immense territory that stretched an estimated 7 million acres from Ecuador into Colombia and Peru. Currently only around 1600 Siekopai remain, 900 in Peru and 700 in Ecuador, where they live in a 50,000-acre fragment of rainforest, surrounded by oil exploitation and oil palm monoculture plantations. In response to the existential threats they face, Jimmy and a group of other young Siekopai leaders have developed a number of innovative projects, safeguarding ancestral shamanic knowledge in video format and running environmental workshops with Siekopai youth. Their next goal is to open an alternative school with an educational model based on their own cosmovision (click here to help them achieve this dream). We spoke to Jimmy about the Siekopai’s resistance strategies and ancestral stories, about his shamanic journey, and how the indigenous worldview could help to combat climate change. WR: How has the pandemic affected Siekopai communities? The Siekopai have been treating Covid-19 with medicinal plants. Photo: Siekopai archive. JP: In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the Siekopai nationality was the first to confirm positive cases of Covid-19. A wise elder died of Covid, he was a family member of mine. He knew a lot about medicinal plants. That was major blow for the Siekopai because they aren’t many of us and we all know each other. Then a teacher died, he had long been involved in the struggle to defend our culture. It was a very difficult situation. We sought help from the local and national governments, but they didn’t really respond. Some allied organisations provided medicines, tests and accurate information. But we started to realise that the medicine from outside, it wasn’t helping us. Faced with many cases of Covid, we started to look to medicinal plants. In the end, the majority of people who survived were treated with medicinal plants. And we’re still treating people with plant infusions, such as ajo del monte, chinchona and cedros with good results. This has led to some very important reflections within the Siekopai communities; a rediscovery, appreciation and faith in our own ancestral medicines. And when everything collapsed in the outside world, although we were affected, we were more or less ok. This has been a deep reflection for us. Seeing how the rest of the world is suffering and realising what is important. Now when so many people in the world are learning to grow food, we keep maintaining our ancestral chakras (traditional small-scale agricultural areas). Now more than ever, we know the importance of our chakras, of our ancestral knowledge, of our medicinal plants. That’s been a real silver lining of the pandemic. On the other hand, our food security situation has become even more precarious, as people from outside our territory take advantage of the pandemic to invade for fishing and hunting. We have been receiving parcels of food aid, and we are very grateful, but these are a short-term solution that create dependency and bring plastic waste into our communities. Food sovereignty is a major problem for us that dates much further back than the pandemic, due to our shrinking territory and contaminated rivers. And the oil companies never stop. Despite the risk of them bringing the virus into the communities, they don’t stop working. WR: Tell us more about the threats to the Siekopai territory. The Siekopai live on the banks of the Aguarico River. Photo: Siekopai archive. JP: We know from documents written by the Jesuits in the 1600s, when the missionaries arrived in Siekopai territory, that there were around 30,000 to 40,000 Siekopai at that time, in the zone between Putumayo, the Aguarico River and Napo. The missionaries brought illnesses such as flu and measles, which extinguished 90% of our population. Whole peoples and clans disappeared. Very few survived, hiding in the depths of the jungle. Then the rubber tappers arrived and removed the Siekopai even from there. So that’s how we lost our territory. We used to have a large population and territory, whereas now we only have around 700 people in Ecuador, living in a very reduced area. We feel very threatened, very worried because our territory is very small and we are surrounded by oil exploitation and monoculture agriculture. The construction of roads is another threat. The state electricity company wants to build an access road within our territory to reach oil wells deep in the jungle. In our Assembly, we voted not to let them build it, but they keep insisting. The roads are a serious threat, our elders are really worried. Many Siekopai don’t want the roads, but others do. There is a part of the community that isn’t really conscious of what our territory means, because of influence from the outside world. I’m not saying the outside world is bad, but we have to find a balance between the two worlds, to decide how we are going to live. But there are some people who don’t think about that. They don’t think about other people, about the elders. They just think about personal benefit. People from outside our territory invade our land for logging and hunting. When there is no work, these people turn to fishing, hunting and felling trees to make money. Our territory is very small and new roads make it even easier to remove natural resources (woods, animals and birds) for sale. This affects our community life and the biodiversity of the area. People sell the wood for pennies to try and send their kids to university. Almost all of the good timber trees are gone. Felling trees makes a lot of noise, the animals flee as far into the jungle as they can. The roads also enable alcohol and drugs to enter our communities. It’s really sad to see how many young Siekopai are trapped in alcoholism and drug addiction. Just when the pandemic started, in February, a young Siekopai who was lost in the world of drugs committed suicide, it was really sad, he was a friend of mine. I know from talking with my father, with our elders, how our territory used to be. Now we have almost no resources, almost no fish, no animals to hunt. Our rivers are contaminated by toxic waste from the oil palm industry. Lack of food sovereignty is a really big worry. These are the threats that we are facing. All of these things have made us think about where we are going. Will our culture survive another five, ten, twenty years? Or will we just die? WR: What are your main strategies of resistance? JP: More and more people in the community are starting to realise that our territory really matters. So we started to monitor the territory, to patrol it, so that people can’t enter and hunt animals. Some families have started to plant various species of timber, edible and medicinal plants in their chakras. They are really happy with this work. Intergenerational workshop. Photo: Siekopai archive. I am part of a group of young Siekopai leaders who have formed an organisation, “Sëra”, which is the spirit of heaven that arrives every Kakotëkawë (summer) to announce a new era. Our first project was to begin safeguarding ancestral shamanic knowledge in video format. Then we started working in the area of education, which has become our primary focus. We run school workshops to promote environmental awareness through intergenerational exchange between the elders, parents and children. We talk about ancestral knowledge, the identification and uses of medicinal plants, the threats that we face. We ask, what is important to us, what do we want to preserve, as Siekopai? The aim is to instil in the children the consciousness that our territory matters, that they should have respect for the elders, for Mother Nature, for our own cosmovision. We know that the children are like seeds; if we plant in them the idea that they must cut down the jungle to plant oil palm, they will want to do that. But instead we are saying to them, we must take care of the jungle, this is our wealth, there are other ways to do things, to survive. That’s why I think education is so important. To address the problem of food sovereignty, we are working on a pisciculture (small-scale sustainable fish farming) project. If our people see that we have real alternatives like this, it would help us to resist the incursion of roads in our territory. WR: What gives you hope and strength to continue fighting, after the Siekopai have suffered so much injustice? JP: Being indigenous means resistance, struggle. My people have been resisting for over 400 years. Even though we have suffered much injustice, displacement, slavery, marginalisation, we have never lost our roots. We have never stopped fighting for freedom, for dignity and, most importantly, for our territories. We keep going with the same strength, with the same wisdom. We keep demanding the right to live once again in the territory of our ancestors, so that we can reconnect with the Great Spirit. “Being indigenous means resistance.” Photo: Erin Deo. My people give me a lot of hope. Even though there is much internal conflict and we have lost 90% of our territory and population, we have never given up. We keep on walking with faith, with our ancestors, who instilled in us the value of life, the value of respect, the value of resistance and the struggle. It also gives me a lot of hope to see young people from other indigenous nationalities and other territories joining their voices with the resistance, doing creative things, working with videos, rescuing our cultural values. I feel that I am not alone. There are lots of people like me, fighting for their territories. We can unite our voices to demand justice, to demand that indigenous territories are autonomous, that we can decide for ourselves what happens in our territories. And that is what gives me a lot of hope. Also, people like you give me hope, we need people like you, who know the outside world, so that our voices can reach more people. So I am really happy to share with you, what we feel, what is happening to us, what we need to keep surviving, as Siekopai, as indigenous people. Sometimes people use racial slurs against indigenous people. This has happened to me, but it’s never made me feel bad. I feel proud to call myself Siekopai, to call myself indigenous. WR: How could the indigenous worldview help to combat climate change? JP: This question really got me thinking. The indigenous worldview is based on living in harmony with nature and other people, respecting everything around us. It is a model that does not require us to plunder all natural resources. We are taught that we are all part of Mother Nature, that it is our responsibility to use resources in a sustainable way. Mother Nature provides everything: medicine, food, water, and air. We don’t need to destroy but to co-exist. This way of life is based on reciprocity. Even if the other person is different to me, we share. Sharing and cooperation. That is how our ancestors lived and that should be the model of how we live too. I think a global shift towards these values could help to combat climate change. A shift towards traditional indigenous agriculture could also help. There is a way of planting, with a prayer to Mother Nature, singing, so that the cassava and plantain grows well. We don’t need to clear a thousand hectares for monoculture plantations. Instead, we plant a diversity of trees, fruit trees, edible plants, and we share what we have. Siekopai community life. Photo: Erin Deo. Traditionally, the Siekopai lived communally in gigantic malokas (open sided wooden huts) with forty to sixty families. This coexistence meant that people did everything together. Everyone got up early around 3am to prepare and drink yoko, twist threads of chambira (a palm from which the fibre is removed to make hammocks) and tell stories and legends. The women would discuss what they would do that day, what the future would bring. The children would be there too, this is how they learned. For us, the maloka is a symbol of living in harmony, communal life, sharing. If one man went hunting, all the men would go hunting together, then they would share the food between everyone. It’s mutual effort, circular effort, in which no-one lacks anything and everyone has the same as everyone else. WR: How have the ancestral stories of the Siekopai passed from generation to generation? Is there a story that is most iconic for the Siekopai? JP: All knowledge, history and legends have been passed down orally, from parents to children, up until today, through daily practices such as hunting, fishing, and building malokas. In our oral traditions, there are many important stories, about plants, animals, spirits. For example, what to do if you’re walking in the jungle and an unknown spirit confronts you and frightens you, so that you don’t get sick. There is one important and relevant story that I’d like to share. One day, some people from the village walked for half a day to go fishing in a river with barbasco (a plant substance used to stun fish so that they can be caught easily). When they arrived at the river, they started making their camp. One man left the group and went to find Juri, the spirit of the wind, who lived in a gigantic tree. The man asked Juri for permission to fish, as she was the owner of the river. She denied his request, saying that it was not the time for fishing, that they would have to wait. The man returned to the group and relayed what Juri had said, that they mustn’t fish, but his companions became angry and didn’t listen to him. They had walked a long way and were hungry, they wanted to eat. The man went once more to speak to Juri, who insisted that he stop his friends from fishing. But when he got back to the river, they had already caught and killed a lot of fish, they were smoking them over a fire and eating happily. In trepidation, the man went to tell Juri what had happened. The spirit of the wind became furious. She told the man to hide in a cave with his family. He ran to get his family, leaving his companions eating fish. On the way, he gathered some orchids, which he used to block the entrance to the cave. The orchids turned into dogs and guarded the family. Suddenly, the sky darkened and there was such a strong wind that tree branches were falling. The family could hear cries of desperation from the camp by the river, for Juri had removed the eyes of all the people who had been fishing, so that they could not return home. The animals of the jungle came, the jaguars, wild boars and ants, and devoured the people at the camp. Only the family in the cave survived. The spirit of the wind lived in a gigantic tree.

The reflection is that if we keep destroying the natural environment, the same thing will soon happen to us, that we will be become blind in the face of so much devastation and Mother Nature could finish us. This story seems very relevant to what is happening today, with the pandemic. The elders told these stories so that we would respect Mother Nature, live in harmony and learn that we don’t have to take all the natural resources, only what we need. WR: What do the spirits of the jungle look like? Have you seen them? JP: It is rare to see the spirits of the jungle, but I have felt them when I’ve been hunting. They live in gigantic ceibo trees in the very deep jungle where no one goes. Those who have seen them, people who go fishing at night, say that they are in the form of humans, about 1.5 metres tall with the nose, eyes and talons of an eagle. They have legs like humans but are covered in black feathers. All the people who have seen them, describe them like that. And when the spirits fly, they always use the wind, strong winds to soar. When there is any kind of exploitation in the jungle, these spirits lose their homes and they leave. WR: The Siekopai nationality is known for its powerful shamans and knowledge of medicinal plants, especially yajé (ayahuasca). Tell us more about this, about your own journey with yajé, and about your project to save this ancient wisdom through videos. JP: My people were always very spiritual, with many drinkers of yajé, many wise elders with a deep connection with the natural spaces, with the times, with animals. We knew yajé well, the spiritual world. When the missionaries arrived in the 60s and 70s, the majority of this knowledge was lost. The missionaries were working with the oil companies, they came to clear the jungle of indigenous peoples and let the oil companies work. The evangelicals prohibited the drinking of yajé, they said it belonged to the devil, and that those who drank it would go to hell. Those fears took hold of the elders. Siekopai elder. Photo: Erin Deo. So many families stopped drinking yajé. My father stopped drinking it, but he still has a lot of knowledge about plants. Very few people still drink yajé, though my grandfather, Bacilio, still does. I have drunk several times with my grandfather. I am on the path of plants, of yajé, of ancestral wisdom. I would like to follow this path further, to learn how to heal. Our elders have this knowledge, how to heal with tobacco smoke, with prayer, how to heal any illness. I have seen many people who are suffering, not just physically but in their souls. I would love to learn how to guide them in the path of life. I would love to be an example on the path of life, of the struggle, of resistance. The struggle has to be undertaken with good actions, not with cheating and lies, but from the heart, always connected with the universe, with the Great Spirit, always with this wisdom. This is my path, my objective that I am pursuing, learning from my father, from our elders. I embarked on this path one day when I returned home from the city and found my mother very sick. In my desperation, I decided to drink yajé, in order to be closer to her if she died. In my yajé visions that night, I was walking and walking in the darkness and I couldn’t find the light. I was shouting and crying, I felt like my heart was broken, empty. I felt terrible pain in my soul, the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It’s not possible to explain it. Eventually, after I had walked and shouted for so long in the darkness, a light appeared next to me and said “I am your god.” I was deeply confused. I thought, why is god here in my yajé vision, when he should be over there in the church? I couldn’t see the entity’s body, but it was wearing a white shining suit. And it said to me, “don’t worry, your mother won’t die, she will be well tomorrow. Keep following this path, I will keep lighting the way for you so that you can do things well.” I left the ceremony at 5am and went back home and my mum was fine, she was working in the chakra. I couldn’t believe it. And that changed my whole perspective on religion, on yajé. I understood that the true god is within all of us, in our positive actions, when we help each other, when we collaborate. God isn’t found in the church, but with each of us. That is what I learned through yajé. There are very few young Siekopai following this path. I know a few, but they are not very committed. When I invite them to ceremony, they go with me. I always invite my nephews, I say to them, come and drink yajé rather than being drunk on beer, come and clean your soul, your spirit, your body. They always thank me afterwards. Jimmy and Ribaldo Piaguaje learning about plants from an elder. Photo: Jerónimo Zúñiga, Amazon Frontlines. At the present time, ancestral knowledge is being rapidly lost. Young people are no longer interested, due to the influence of the western world. Our wise elders are dying without leaving a legacy. Together with another young Siekopai defender, I created a project to safeguard their knowledge with videos. We go out with them when they are harvesting plants and record them talking about how they identify and use them. (To learn more about this project and see some of the videos, click here). This project brought our group of young leaders together and we started to organise. In August, my community held an important ceremony of yajé. The month of August (which is known as Kakotëkawë in our language) is very important to us, it’s the month of spirituality. According to our cosmovision, the celestial beings arrive in the treetops in the month of August. So, when one takes yajé, it is possible to connect with them more easily, with the Great Spirit. This is when we reflect on things that we need to improve, we plant and repair our chakras. In the month of August, our emotions are much stronger, we are very sensitive, we have to take great care of how we treat others, to be especially kind. WR: Tell us about Lagartococha, the spiritual centre of the Siekopai, and the struggle to reclaim it. JP: Pë’këya (Lagartococha) is the spiritual centre of the Siekopai. In the time before the arrival of the white men, the great Siekopai shamans from all corners of our territory gathered at the lagoons in Kakotëkawë (August) to perform yajé ceremonies, accompanied by the Kofanes and other indigenous peoples. In their visions, they connected with the Great Spirit, so that their peoples would never lack food, animals or fish, and would not be afflicted by disease. The shamans also looked into the future and let the people know that there was hope; that it was time to prepare their chakras and live well. Today we follow the same path, every August we travel to Pë’këya to perform a ceremony, but there is no tranquility there now. Our ancestral territory has been lost to us and the struggle to reclaim it isn’t recent, it’s an old struggle, of our elders. Our ancestors in that area suffered a lot, they were displaced by the rubber tappers and enslaved. Then, in the 1940s, Pë’këya was ravaged by the war between Ecuador and Peru. Our people there had to abandon their territory, to escape. When the area was divided by the militarisation of the border, some Siekopai communities and families did not see each other for half a century, until the signing of the 1998 peace treaty allowed reunification. Following the war, the Ecuadorian State declared the area a reserve. Without acknowledging that the land is our ancestral territory, without recognizing that the Siekopai have always been present there, the State signed the land over to the Kichwas of Zancudo. To the State, jungle is jungle, they didn’t even ask who it belonged to. We don’t have a problem with the Kichwas, our complaint is directed at the State for violating our ancestral rights. We have asked for adjudication but we remain unanswered. Our hopes of surviving as Siekopai rest on returning to Pë’këya, to our territory of origin, to reconnect with the spirits so that the shamans can pass their knowledge to the young. With the mandate of the elders, we built a ceremonial house there by a lagoon and planted yajé, in order to maintain the spiritual connection that allows us to live well. But the ceremonial house was burned by the Kichwas of Zancudo. We are really sad about this. We are people of peace, we do not want more war. WR: How does the dominant economic model impact the destruction of the Amazon? JP: The economic issue is one of the main drivers of destruction in the Amazon. The manufactured need for money is why there is so much deforestation and the animals are becoming extinct. And yet, Amazonian communities need money like everyone one else. Those who say that money doesn’t exist in the indigenous world, don’t live in reality. Indigenous peoples need money because this need has been created in our communities by the outside world. So what should we do about this? I have seen many examples of circular economies, cooperatives with horizontal structures. In these kind of community banks, no-one has privilege over anyone else, everyone in the organisation has a voice and a vote. The profits go to everyone, not just a powerful few. And that is how the money system should work in indigenous communities. There are lots of people who are experts on this topic. There should be training courses on this, so we can learn how this model works. One of the main reasons that indigenous people need money is to educate their children. Going to university is very expensive for indigenous peoples. The need for this type of education, which was also introduced by the outside world, is a big driver for deforestation and must be resolved urgently. I have seen that some Siekopai who study outside go on to exploit the natural resources of indigenous communities, using their university education as justification. So the higher education system is a double threat: people cut down trees so their children can be educated in a system of thought that itself leads to more destruction. If we keep going with the same monopolised education model, that we can see isn’t working, that doesn’t meet our needs, that doesn’t create consciousness in young people, the same things will keep happening. More pandemics, floods, earthquakes. These are the reactions of Mother Nature, telling us that something is wrong. WR: Why is the subject of education so important to you? JP: Education is the fundamental pillar of society. The system of thought implemented in the curriculum generates the interaction between people and their ecosystems. There are many educational pedagogies that represent different ways of thinking, but the current education system is monopolized. This reduces the diversity of possibilities to create a better world for humanity and the planet. The current model only prepares us to work in a company, it doesn’t teach us how to coexist. Society has to ask what is the objective of education. The reality of a society is a reflection of its education system. The current world situation shows us that monopolized education is not working. We can see this in climate change, in all the conflicts that are happening, in extractivism. Educational pedagogies exist that are based on an objective of creating harmony between people and the environment. Although these are in the minority, they could be effective in these times of crisis to redirect the way in which we live. “The territories of ancestral peoples are rich in understanding that is unknown to the Western world.” Photo: Siekopai archives. Indigenous peoples have had their own educational pedagogy for thousands of years that has allowed their communities and the natural environment to prosper, cycle after cycle. The territories of ancestral peoples are rich in understanding that is unknown to the western world. Sadly, the last generation to hold this knowledge is dying faster than ever, without transmitting it to the young people who are being educated in cities. We have been working to preserve this knowledge through environmental workshops, which have been so successful that our next goal is to expand these into an alternative school. We have designed an educational model based on our own cosmovision, which allowed us to thrive in harmony with the natural environment for millennia. Our curriculum will blend this ancestral wisdom with aspects of modern knowledge to incorporate subjects such as permaculture, audio visual techniques and communications technology. The aim is to train conscious people capable of creating innovative, sustainable solutions. We hope to instil a value for life, a value that teaches people to be different, to think, and to do what they really love. WR: How can the international community support your efforts? JP: There are two ways in which people can help us. In order to open our alternative school, we need to legalise our organisation, Sëra, as an NGO. We have been working on this process since 2018, but our efforts have been stalled by bureaucracy and lack of resources. We have put together a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for this and would be very grateful for any contributions. Sharing the campaign would also be a great help. We also ask people to follow us on social media (Twitter @NSiekopai, Facebook @Siekopai) and Instagram @Nacion.Siekopai) and keep an eye out for our forthcoming Twitter storm to pressure the Ecuadorian State to formally adjudicate the case of our ancestral territory in Lagartococha. Deoji! (Thank you!) Siekopai children. Photos: Erin Deo Jimmy Piaguaje was interviewed by Beth Pitts, who has been working with indigenous communities in Ecuador since 2013, especially those defending their territories from extractivism. From these defenders, Beth learned that community-led eco-tourism enables them to protect threatened ecosystems and unique ways of life. This inspired her to write the Moon Guide to Ecuador & The Galapagos Islands (2019), the first international guidebook on Ecuador with a focus on ethical travel. Beth is part of the Writers Rebel team and is excited by the alchemic possibilities of uniting the two forces that give her the most hope for the future: indigenous nature defenders and Extinction Rebellion. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/12/newsletter-45/,"(Sign up to the newsletter here.) Dear rebels, It took four agonising days to hear them, but the American people have spoken. They have rejected four more years of fossil fuel promotion and climate science denial. They have elected someone who will rejoin the Paris Agreement and has promised a Clean Energy Revolution. In doing so, they have given all of us something precious: hope. Asian politics has also given us reasons to smile. Both Japan and South Korea have pledged to reach “carbon neutrality” by 2050, following on from China’s pledge to do the same before 2060. Of course, the climate crisis is destroying lives today. It’s too easy for politicians to set distant targets and draw ambitious roadmaps, when climate science and lived experience shows action is needed now. And however unified and well-meaning the pledges of governments appear, they offer little comfort when environmental destruction continues with such ferocity on the ground. The Red Brigade mourn a forest being cleared for a motorway in Germany. In this issue, we have stories of forests being destroyed on every continent of the world. Even when we know how vital these habitats are to our collective survival, both in their ability to absorb carbon and contain disease, still their global devastation continues. How long can we prize industry, infrastructure, or even just recreation, above life itself? Also in this issue, we cover the rolling rebellions that launched in four major capitals across Europe, a sign that despite the pandemic, our movement continues to fight for real political progress on the climate, and real protection of our precious habitats. Italian rebels blockade the HQ of national oil company ENI. Shortly before losing the election, the outgoing American President sanctioned the opening up of Tongass National park in Alaska to logging, the largest temperate rainforest in the world. We should celebrate when destructive personalities are shown the door. But we have to ensure we are rid of the destructive habits too. The truth is, civil disobedience is needed today as much as it ever was. If you’d like to help, please check out our website and learn more about XR.

Support the Rebellion OCT | Bugoma, Uganda & Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo Ugandan rebels are racing to stop the clearing of swathes of forest to make way for a sugarcane plantation. Conservation experts have long warned that destroying even a small fraction of Bugoma’s tropical forest ecosystem would have devastating impacts for flora and fauna, and affect the water levels of the River Nile. Alongside other environmentalist groups, Ugandan rebels joined a 10km run to raise awareness about the clearance, and launched a petition to the Ugandan parliament to stop the destruction. Photo: XR Uganda As workers began felling the giant trees in the disputed area, activists and journalists covering the destruction were shot at and arrested by the military. However, Ugandan rebels believe that there may be a “ray of hope” as the world has woken up to their protest. The Ugandan government is being hauled before the East African Court of Justice and international groups including the EU are condemning the clearance. The action came mere weeks after rebels in neighbouring DRC took to the streets. Rebels from XR Université de Goma condemned ongoing attempts to license oil drilling in Virunga National Park - a UNESCO world heritage site. Painted green and covered in leaves, the rebels marched through Goma city and held signs calling for an end to environmental destruction.

The Indonesian government has passed a new law that will devastate the country’s tropical forests - currently the 3rd largest in the world. The ‘Omnibus bill’ has been sold to the public as pro-business and necessary for the nation’s economic recovery after Covid. But the reality is that the 1000-page bill began life before the pandemic, has been rushed through parliament to avoid scrutiny, and strips away both environmental protections and workers rights to such a degree that even global investors are criticising it. Many of the people who drafted the bill have been linked to the coal industry. Photo: AntaraFoto/Basri Marzuki Workers and students across Indonesia have risen up against the bill, but the brutal police reaction has stopped XR Indonesia from officially joining the protests. Thousands of Indonesians have been arrested for simply gathering in public, and reports of police violence and rioting are widespread. At least two students have been hospitalised with head injuries. XR Indonesia is instead coordinating with other environmental groups to hold a parade through Jakarta later this month. The peaceful demo will be held the day before the Asian Climate Rally and echo its 5 key demands - one of which is to repeal all environmentally damaging laws.

Photo: AMW 5 - 9 OCT | Berlin, Germany German rebels protested against the cutting down of ancient forests to make way for a new motorway by blockading the state construction company responsible for building it. Rebels surrounded the Berlin headquarters and used a huge dying tree sculpture as well as chains and glue to barricade themselves across its entrance. Several brave rebels stood topless to draw media attention to the destruction. Flares were let off to symbolise the forest burning. The blockade outside DEGES - Germany’s state motorway construction company. The Dannenroder forest is the largest to be threatened by the new motorway, and protestors have built tree houses along the proposed route. The forest is home to 200 year old trees, endangered animals, and a key regional water reserve. Treehouse defenders have already been evicted and trees felled in neighbouring forests. The blockade marked the final day of the Berlin Rebellion, and it was not the only blockade to make headlines. Earlier 300 rebels set up roadblocks that closed off all 5 streets around the national Parliament for several hours. Angry at their politicians for postponing a promised coal phase-out, they called for an ecocide law that criminalised climate and environmental damage. Rebels bring the wildfires to Berlin by showing fire on their phones. The coal lobby was targeted when 30 rebels occupied the offices of the German Lignite Industry Association. Several hundred more rebels blocked the street outside and demanded transparency and accountability. Before they were peaceably ejected by police, the office-occupying rebels threw (fake) documents from the windows - a symbolic freedom of information on fossil fuel vested interests. As the week progressed, the Rebellion Wave reached the Brazilian embassy to amplify the voices of indigenous defenders and express grief for those who have lost their lives on the climate crisis frontline - people like Macarena Valdes, Paulo Paulino and Zezico Guajajara.

Italian rebels converged on Rome for thier week of Rebellion, and their first target of protest for Italy’s continued inaction on the climate was their government. Rebels sang, danced and made speeches on the central Piazza San Silvestro. They then held a mass die-in as the ravishing Red Brigade wandered among them. When a rebel group headed for the nearby Piazza del Parliament to deliver a declaration to lawmakers, vehicles full of armed police blocked the way, responding to the peaceful protestors as if they were some kind of terrorist group. Italy’s rebellion opens with a dose of discobedience. Shaken but undeterred, the Roman rebels used their second day of disobedience to focus on the media. They massed outside news media giant GEDI and created a performative barricade to highlight examples of media greenwashing - notably how GEDI’s leading newspaper has an environmental section sponsored by a car manufacturer and Italy’s national oil company ENI! ENI's headquarters got a rebel visit, too. The blockade outside its gates lasted an impressive 53 hours as 60 chained up rebels sang and played music to the bitter end. Meanwhile, a rebel letter sent to 2 key finance Ministers called for the government to divest its 30.33% stake in ENI and recognise the oil firm’s long track record of corruption and human rights violations. Italian rebels - the naked truth. On the penultimate day of Rebellion, around 400 rebels moved onto the iconic Piazza dell'Esquilino to enact ‘the naked truth’. A few brave rebels bared their bodies in public to draw attention to the media’s silence on the climate crisis. Even with the week of Rebellion officially over, 8 rebels staged a final sit-in on the steps of Parliament, explaining to passing politicians why the Coronavirus economic stimulus package they just voted for was a betrayal of science and ecology.

Spanish rebels staged local Rebellions across a very impressive 14 cities over the last month. The action kicked-off with some urgent ‘post’ to the Department of the Environment in Madrid. Written on dry wood, the text highlighted the widespread desertification affecting Spain. Online, there was a lively Facebook Live event exploring the power of ‘Kick(ass)emblea’ (Citizens Assemblies) to unlock democracy. The ‘Monument to the Bull Run’ in Pamplona was also re-dedicated as a warning of the dangers of environmental breakdown. In Granada, rebels locked-on at a bank, while in Cadiz, traffic was stopped. But in all Spanish cities, die-ins with XR Doctors made visible the past, present and future climate deaths brought about by their government’s inaction. XR Doctors count the cost of climate inaction. Madrid’s rebels were forced to delay their contribution to the Spanish Rebellion due to a regional lockdown, but with November started they were able to launch into some delayed disobedience. First up they marched out and glued-on outside the Ministry of Agriculture - connecting themselves with plants and leaves to show how biodiversity creates a natural barrier against pandemics like Covid-19. Simply put, nature saves lives. Later they created a giant blue tide in the capital’s main street to represent how humanity is drowning, how extreme weather is displacing people, and how we rebels are rising up!

The famous landmark of love urged people everywhere to ‘REBEL’, and 9 other cities in France heard its call. 150 litres of fake blood were spilled in central Lille, the University Bridge in Leon was blockaded, and in Orleans adverts pushing over-consumption were given an XR makeover. Rebels “violently resisting” arrest according to French police. A beautiful action called ‘The Slow Walk’ took place in Paris, with rebels moving steadily between several symbolic landmarks to highlight our frantic pace of life and how it stops us from seeing the destruction around us. But rebel pulses quickened during an action at the Ministry of Ecology. Rebels sprayed its entrance green and blockaded the roads around it, locking on and laying down on the rain soaked tarmac. But police came in hard, accusing rebels of ‘violently resisting’ for simply lying there. 8 were arrested and 6 held in police custody for over 24 hours. Construction companies and concrete manufacturers were also called out for their role in climate breakdown, with concrete production contributing to 8% of global CO2 emissions. Rebels stopped mixers from leaving concrete and cement producer LafargeHolcim, significantly delaying construction of an extension to the Paris Metro.

South African rebels have mounted a number of protests against Standard Bank South Africa, the continent’s biggest lender. Standard Bank is helping to finance a 1,443km crude oil pipeline through Uganda and Tanzania. If built, the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) would be the longest heated crude oil pipeline in the world. A broad coalition of African and other organisations are fighting the pipeline. In a powerful letter, they highlight the displacement of entire communities, impacting up to 14,500 farms in Tanzania alone; risks to fresh water sources including Lake Victoria, which supports the livelihoods of more than 30 million people; degradation of habitats of African elephants, eastern chimpanzees and lions; and the climate impact of the 216,000 barrels of crude oil expected to be carried daily by the pipeline, resulting in CO2 emissions of 33 million tonnes a year.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/12/extreme-weather-climate-change/,"Source: Pixabay Scientists agree we have changed the global climate system by heating it. Within this hotter system, our regional weather patterns have changed too. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, hurricanes, flash floods have become a lot more frequent in the last twenty years alone. It is now clear that there are direct links between the increased frequency and intensity of these events and human actions that are accelerating climate change. At the end of 2019, the American Meteorological Society (AMS) drew attention to heavy rainfall on the east coast of the United States and record-setting low-levels of sea ice in the arctic as a result of human-caused climate change. The AMS made this report in its 8th annual bulletin, Explaining Extreme Events in 2018 from a Climate Perspective. The bulletin’s editor, climate scientist Dr. Stephanie Herring is one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers recognized by Foreign Policy magazine. Speaking of her work at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Herring stated: “[W]e are … seeing mounting evidence for our ability to identify a climate change signal in different types of extreme weather events, especially for forest fires and precipitation.” Another leading climate attribution scientist - someone who studies the links between climate and extreme weather - Dr. Friederike Otto of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, agrees. According to Otto, climate attribution science is cautious and conservative, so it probably underestimates how much extreme weather is driven by climate change. Source: Michael Held, Unsplash The United States’ National Climate Assessment concluded in 2014 that humans have changed the earth’s patterns of warming and cooling by increasing atmospheric carbon. As extreme weather patterns and climate events have grown in recent decades, new evidence has shown that, in some cases, this is being driven by human activity. Extreme weather will continue to be both more frequent, and more intense. Increasing levels of heat energy trapped in the atmosphere and oceans will lead to hotter, wetter, and stormier weather. Extreme rainfall, powerful Atlantic hurricanes, Australian cyclones, high tide flooding, and massive storm surges in coastal areas are just some of the events we will be faced with on a more regular basis. It’s not only scientists who have been warning us about the rise of extreme weather. Finance and insurance experts have been linking atmospheric carbon and extreme weather for decades. “Forty weather disasters in 2019 caused damages exceeding $1 billion each,” reports McKinsey and Company, a management consulting firm — and “the economic toll ... has been escalating.” Munich Re is a global reinsurance company that insures insurance companies. They have studied how “the frequency of weather-related catastrophes rises in step with global warming” since the early 1970s. Today Munich Re warns of the increasing risks of floods, cyclones, winter storms, thunderstorms, hail, tornados, wildfires, droughts and heatwaves. Some companies, like Risk Management Solutions (RMS), specialize in analyzing these risks for insurers. Insurance Australia Group (IAG) is a reinsurer that has seen its profits cut in half due to bushfires and COVID-19. IAG’s first Severe Weather in a Changing Climate (2019) said Australia’s “bushfire seasons are becoming longer and more extreme”. This is in the context of The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) labelling the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires one of “the worst wildlife disasters in modern history.” In addition to the risk of more big fires, IAG also predicts stronger cyclones with wind speeds up to 251km/h that will strike deeper inland. In the past, major Australian population centers were not threatened by these storms. As such, cities now at risk like Brisbane and the Gold Coast were not built to withstand high winds. It’s not surprising, then, that the late 2020 edition of the IAG’s ‘severe weather report’ predicts “greater property, personal and economic damage, and hardship for Australian communities.” Source: Philip Flores, Unsplash The United States’ Commodity Futures Trading Commission has made “dire warnings” about the impact of climate change-driven extreme weather on agricultural commodities. In the past, agriculture was a safe place to invest pension and retirement funds, but that is no longer the case. Extreme weather threatens food production and distribution, and this is driving investors away. The US military has been affected by extreme weather too — from hurricanes and floods damaging air force bases to equipment failures, to a dramatic rise in heat-related casualties. Fighting in hot weather requires supply lines carrying more water, fuel, and other provisions which then become targets. Source: Marcus Kauffman, Unsplash You can think of the increased risk for extreme weather on a warming planet this way: what if a simple coin toss stopped resulting in the expected 50/50 split? If I flip a coin fifty times, I expect nearly half the tosses will come up heads, and nearly half should come up tails. If I flipped a coin and saw it come up on the same side 60% of the time, after hundreds of tosses I would believe something was biasing the coin to give those results. Climate change is like that. More carbon in the atmosphere “rigs” the “game” - the earth’s climate system - meaning we are going to be “unlucky” more often than we would have been a century ago. There is already widespread scientific consensus that we are experiencing more extreme weather today as a result of global warming. What is alarming is that the more carbon emissions we release, the more we bias the earth’s climate towards these extreme weather events, with potentially disastrous results. The following information comes from IAG’s 2019 report, Severe Weather in A Changing Climate. In Africa, average temperatures are increasing more than we see in other parts of the world. The impact of adverse weather in Africa is often worse than other regions since 70% of the population rely on growing their food themselves. Unfortunately, Africa’s extreme heat impacts are not being studied adequately. Source: Thom Milkovic, Unsplash The science is clear, the reporting on extreme weather is everywhere, and the costs in life and money are mounting. Climate change is driving more extreme weather all over the planet. Much of it is heat-related. We can expect more catastrophes like the Australian wildfires of 2019-2020 if we do not radically reduce our carbon emissions. There are so many environmental and human losses from extreme weather. As Courtney Plante and Craig Anderson of Iowa State University point out, the devastation from climate change and extreme weather can be directly traced to increased aggression and violent conflict. Let’s work together to get our governments to tell the truth about climate change, act now to stop killing the biosphere, and bring our emissions to net-zero for a peaceful, shared life on earth. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/10/jose-gualinga-interview/,"This interview was first published on Writers Rebel. José Gualinga is a leader of the Native People of Sarayaku, an indigenous Kichwa group with 1400 inhabitants living in a remote part of Ecuador’s southern Amazon. Known for their defence of the rights of nature and indigenous peoples, the Sarayaku call themselves the People of Noon, referring to an ancient prophecy of their ancestors claiming that they would be a pillar of resistance after other communities had surrendered, a beacon of light as strong as the midday sun. In 2012, the Sarayaku won a historic victory at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which found that the Ecuadorian State had violated their rights by allowing an oil company to prospect in their territory without consultation. A turning point in the case was when José’s father, Don Sabino Gualinga, the spiritual leader of Sarayaku and their most eminent yachak (shaman), then aged 92, took the witness stand. He was asked about the impact of the 1,433 kilograms of explosives that had been planted in Sarayaku territory by the oil company, accompanied by armed military personnel. Referring to the invisible beings that had been disturbed by the explosions, Don Sabino said that “half of the lords of the jungle are no longer there”. “It is a living forest. There are trees and medicinal plants and all kinds of beings… Many hid, others died when it burst. They are the ones who maintain the jungle, the forest … All of those who wish to cause damage, they don’t understand what they are doing. We do understand it, because we see it.” The same year, the Sarayaku created the Kawsak Sacha (Living Forest) Declaration asserting that, as a living entity, their territory is subject to legal rights and demanding that these rights be upheld. The proposal was presented at the global climate change conference, COP21, and the President of France, François Hollande, in 2015, and to the Ecuadorian Government in 2018. The Sarayaku have also launched a professional football team to spread the word about oil exploitation in the Amazon; sailed a canoe down the Seine; and created a documentary, Children of the Jaguar, which won Best Documentary at the National Geographic Film Festival in 2012. In 2020, the Sarayaku are once again under threat, with the Ecuadorian Government’s plan to auction 3 million hectares of largely virgin rainforest to oil companies, including nearly all the Sarayaku territory. To represent their peaceful resistance to extractivism and commitment to defend the Kawsak Sacha (Living Jungle), the Sarayaku are planting a perimeter of flowering trees around their territory. Known as the Sisa Ñampi, the Border of Life or Living Path of Flowers, it currently stretches for 100km and will take decades to complete, eventually encircling their territory of 135,000 hectares, symbolising the fragility of life, and the ephemeral limit of existence between life and death. WR: How has the pandemic affected the Sarayaku and how is the community dealing with it? JG: This disease is unknown to the people of Sarayaku, as were the historical diseases introduced by the first rubber tappers. Back then, it is told that many Sarayaku people died of smallpox and measles, there were corpses all over Sarayaku and scenes of desolation. At that time, many people fled into the remote jungle to avoid death. Some never returned. During the first days of the current health alert, many Sarayaku families who live in the cities returned to their lands in the jungle to avoid being infected. This made the spread of the virus within the community inevitable, despite the controls and resolutions that we adopted. At the same time, the Bobonaza River burst its banks, causing severe flooding and devastating homes and crops. This was a disaster for us and put the community in an extremely vulnerable state. The pandemic affected community social life, mobility, economic and food sovereignty, health and education. Many families went into voluntary isolation, retreating into the remote jungle where we have our purinas or tambos (huts far from the community where we go to rest, hunt, fish, and be in connection with the world of the Living Jungle). This was an effective preventive measure that ensured food security and health. However, these relatively untouched places conserve the largest reserves of fauna and flora, and these natural resources started to become scarce due to the long stays of the families who were depending solely on hunting, fishing and gathering. In the end, the Sarayaku people fought the virus alone, with no state assistance. In this chaotic situation, ancestral knowledge was our spearhead and strength in defeating this tiny but deadly virus, enabling us to confront, resist, and eliminate this foreign body. With the use of rare, little-known medicinal plants we have managed, little by little, to overcome and coexist with the virus. We continue to use medicinal plants, barks, lianas, roots, fruits and tubers to strengthen defences and immunity. The pandemic provided an opportunity for many families who had forgotten these ancient practices to regain their ancestral wisdom. With our historical experience of struggle and resistance, the Sarayaku people returned to their legacy of the ayllu (extended families) and the minga (community collective work). With the unity and solidarity of national and international friends and allies, the pandemic has been a learning experience, bringing the reflection that we are a fragile and vulnerable world, but that together we can make life more just and humane. WR: How can the philosophical thought of the Sarayaku (known as Tiam) help to combat climate change? JG: The world of the forest and the ancient cultures that still coexist in communion with the Living Jungle, the jungle of beings, can inspire complex and philosophical thoughts. We are inspired to reflect on the cosmos; on traditional ways of life based on hunting, fishing and agriculture; on medicine, sacred plants, sociocultural themes, history and spirituality. Living off the natural resources of the forest in the 21st Century allows us to maintain resistance against the aggressive globalized world of the market, in which most of the citizens of the planet are immersed. This principle of life has allowed us to think that it is possible to coexist, respecting the balance of the earth and using only what is necessary to live. The people and leaders of Sarayaku do not want to be left behind in a static conformist way just waiting for solutions. On the contrary, we have decided to be part of the global solution by contributing with our experience, thought, knowledge and philosophy of life from the belly of the living forest. The peoples of the native communities of the Amazon are those in closest contact with the earth and communion with the beings of the Living Jungle, and the Sarayaku are among those peoples. Climate change will only be resolved if we actively seek solutions. Global citizens must undertake a long road to resistance and peaceful struggle, towards a different perspective that we call Tiam. By itself this philosophical thought is only a form of knowledge, but it can be made reality if each and every one of us participates in the minga (collective community work). Tiam is a counterpoint to the dominant worldview, which sees nature as “other”; as an object for exploitation. This has led to imbalance and severe climatic changes, as well as the current pandemic. At the heart of our philosophy lies the understanding that we live as an embryo in the womb of the Pachamama (Mother Earth). Only in this way will nature be respected, will we live harmoniously, benefiting from the resources that the Pachamama bestows on us. We believe that if the human being accepts this way of life, the pain of the planetary wound will be felt, healed, and life will be born again. More than ever, we believe that humanity needs to once again feel the earth; to recognize and declare that the seas, glaciers, volcanoes are alive, living; to feel coexistence within ourselves; to realize that we are nature itself. Tiam proposes the creation of new indicators of wealth and value, which should measure the richness of a healthy and fertile land, abundant fauna, uncontaminated rivers, life in solidarity, sharing, unity, and the equitable distribution of wealth. It suggests radical changes in the global education system to incorporate this philosophical thought at every stage, from the family unit, through early educational centres to the highest level of study. Indigenous Peoples are already contributing towards global climate change solutions by taking care of their territories, which are mega-diversities of living beings. The Sarayaku conceived the Kawsak Sacha (Living Jungle) life project as a powerful nucleus and epicentre, so that through these invisible beings, who are conscious and therefore to legal rights, we can regulate the balance of the earth and together we can fight climate change. The phenomenon of climate change and the floods we suffered in March do not surprise us. These are the reactions of a powerful force in response to the harmful effects it faces. It is the same force invoked by our taytas or yachaks (shamans) to heal the sick and restore life. Water is a living being and its form represents health and freshness. Its strength is so powerful that it can destroy everything, or it can heal and leave the earth clean and fertile. WR: How have the ancestral stories of the Sarayaku passed from generation to generation? Is there an ancient story that is most iconic for the Sarayaku? JG: History was passed down to us orally by our fathers, mothers and elders. When we were children, stories were told to us on rainy days, in the chacras (food gardens), before sleeping, in the hunting houses in the jungle, when we were plucking out our parents' grey hair, or during jayawaska (ayahuasca) rituals. This is how we learned from many past lives. Sadly, these traditions are being lost due to their replacement with the western educational model. From one to the other, all the ancestral stories are relevant and fundamental; stories of rivalries, of the skills and abilities of iconic characters, of legends and origins. Each extended family has its own history, there is not a single history for the whole community due to a diversity of human groups that migrated to Sarayaku, such as Naporunas, colonists, Urayrunas, Sapara, Achuar. The most important aspect of our history is that Sarayaku was founded by Ramón Gualinga, father of Baltazar Gualinga. Also called Pandu, Baltazar was a person who could transform into a jaguar and was King of the wild boars. The elders say that the Sarayaku are the People of Noon, in reference to our principles, dignity and courage. We are the dutzi llakta (a town and its people when the sun is in the middle of the sky at a single point). According to an ancient prophecy, the Sarayaku will resist to the end, even after other peoples have surrendered. Another story tells of the defeat of the Shirapas, now known as the Shuar, in a war commanded by Santiago Gualinga, who grew up with his abducted mother after his father was assassinated. There are two stories that are most relevant for me personally. One is about my parents, especially my mother, who grew up an orphan in the middle of the jungle, in a family of very powerful yachaks (shamans), who were at the same time refuted and persecuted. The other story on to which I have projected my political vision of struggle is about a person who battles a giant boa to liberate his people. The boa is devouring everything and the only way to vanquish it is with a bamboo knife, not an iron knife. This story moved me a lot. We used it as the basis from which to direct the struggle and peaceful resistance of the Sarayaku people, as symbolised by the flower, the Living Path of Flowers. After reading the story, I came to a conclusion about the meaning of the bamboo knife and the iron one. In the resistance and struggle of Sarayaku and the native peoples, the bamboo weapon was fundamental because it represents the powerful knowledge that our world possesses; our wisdom, art, culture, history and philosophy. The iron knife, in contrast, represents violent struggle; the armed struggle that causes serious ongoing social and political problems for so many peoples. The transformative story of the bamboo knife has inspired our global visions and concrete actions. It gives us the strength to resist peacefully, without violence. WR: According to Sarayaku's worldview, the ability to communicate with the living jungle is considered the highest form of knowledge, only achieved by the best yachaks (shamans) like your father, Don Sabino Gualinga. How does your father see and communicate with the spirits of the forest? Are there any young shamans with this ability? JG: I consider the philosophical thought of the Kawsak Sacha (Living Jungle) as the most advanced wisdom on earth. The coexistence with non-visible beings such as Amazanga, Sacharuna and Nunguly, the protectors of fertility and the abundance that balances life, is a system of cultural education of its own. The way of life based on symbiosis with these beings is a fundamental and concrete principle. Therefore, for us, the lagoons have life, the beings are present there, and in the swamps. The trees are human beings that, together with the sacred waterfalls, grasslands and hills, make a daily millennial life system that continues to maintain the ecological balance of the Living Jungle or the Pachamama. The yachaks intertwine with these beings through visions, communicating and agreeing to maintain friendship and sustain the balance of abundance and fertility. The yachaks communicate and transmit these teachings to us and demand us to respect and be humble in front of these beings, the owners and masters of life, of biological richness. The most important aspect of this knowledge is that the entire society is educated to comprehend it as a way of life, in order to continue coexisting in harmony with the Kawsak Sacha (Living Jungle). Don Sabino Gualinga, like other experts in this field, is a wise man who has always advocated and spread the concept that the jungle is living, with all the beings, owners and masters who take care of and guard the source of life. In Sarayaku there are several young people who have started the initiation process to become yachaks, to become experts in healing and achieving communion with these beings through visions. However, things have changed since the yachaks of our parents’ generation, such as Don Sabino, who followed a long process of abstinence, a strict diet, a hard and sacrificial apprenticeship. Though the knowledge of today’s youth will be renewed and modernised, it is based on the same principle: that wisdom will continue to be strengthened via the Living Jungle, including the visions that allow us to enter into communion with the protective beings. WR: How do the Sarayaku People maintain unity, when other indigenous peoples have been divided by the oil companies? JG: Unity is not based simply on an organizational body of a people, but instead on a historical and cultural principle. The unity of the Sarayaku arises from the legacy of our ancestors, from the great stories and prophecies that have led us to consider ourselves as the People of Noon, descendants of the Jaguar, children of Amazanga Runa. Other nationalities, let us call them communities or peoples, their unity is maintained in a superficial way, through an organisation. While the statute of the organisation may be recognized by the competent authorities, the people lack the background of using their history and wisdom as a strength. When the unity of a society, or let's call it a cultural civilization, of the Amazon forest is founded on historical and cultural principle, the oil companies cannot break it. The Sarayaku act under the principle of symbols and behaviours of different species, such as the strength of ants, the commands of birds, etc. We are also guided by our spirituality and use of ayahuasca as the sacred plant that allows us to orient ourselves in the world. WR: How could a western activist movement like Extinction Rebellion learn from the indigenous worldview and be founded on the principle of interconnectivity rather than individuality? It is not necessary to completely adopt the native peoples’ way of thinking. However, there is a lot of knowledge in our worldview that could contribute to society and raise awareness in other cultures of the world. If native peoples, who are also predatory and consumerist human beings, have managed to preserve forests until today, in the 21st century, that means it must be possible to find a solution to the climate, social and economic crises that humanity faces. What capitalists might call the “subsistence” economic systems of native peoples may be considered insignificant within a macroeconomic system, but our economies are based on a structure that is essential to lead an individual and collective life. Our systems of rotary or circular agriculture, hunting, fishing and gathering, are in fact economies of consumption, but their principle of sustainability is what interests us. There is much more to the traditional practices of hunting and fishing than the simple art of killing an animal. These practices go beyond simplistic food consumption and are, in fact, related to the principle of the Living Jungle. From her, comes abundance, the market, health, and the connection with the other beings who regulate the fertility of the earth. So, it is about the form and conduct of the collective individual who assumes within himself the wisdom to use this resource that feeds us each day, in a balanced and rational way. The philosophy of Tiam states that the economic model should be proposed from this logic, i.e., that the human being is not the priority or essential factor in society but, on the contrary, the land, the jungle, the rivers, everything that makes up Life itself, are the fundamentals upon which we depend. With this shift to a different perspective, a different vision, society in general would no longer treat the resources of the living forest as mere objects of market value and exploitation. Human capacity would be the most advanced, behaving with deep respect to use resources in a harmonious and necessary way. As you can see, this contribution of knowledge is fundamental, but it’s difficult to share it in an individualistic and selfish society accustomed to consumption and competition. Interconnectivity translates into creating the ability to understand and connect through invisible networks with cosmic life forms who are similar to us, but are not visible. These are the protective beings that create fertility, those who give us the wealth of emotional happiness and spiritual inspiration, those who orchestrate Sumak Kawsay (Life in Harmony). WR: How do the people of Sarayaku make democratic decisions? JG: Although decision-making practices can be manifested in a democratic expression, the word “democracy” is unknown in the Amazonian world. Historically, democratic decisions were made in families and then in extended families to ultimately reach a decisive conclusion. The social organization was led by Kurakas, warriors with great talent and wisdom. When the missionaries arrived, they introduced the ceremonial staff as a substitute for the spear, creating the system of the Barayok (He with the Staff), with different hierarchical levels, such as Captain, Sheriff and Prosecutor. In 1979 we implemented a new form of social organization, the People’s Assembly, which is more institutional but alien to our traditional way of organising. Currently, our most important decisions are made in an assembly or congress of the people. We have a Governing Council that includes representatives for women, youth and wisdom keepers. Sarayaku is made up of seven communities, each with its own leader or Kuraka. These authorities are nominated each year to serve and help the people (which is the opposite of helping oneself from the people). A Kuraka must share his entire agricultural economy, such as cassava, during mingas (collective community work days). In decision-making, the voices and decisions of women as well as those of men, the wisdom keepers and the youth are very important. Elections are generally by consensus, where necessary by secret ballot. The office of Kuraka lasts one year, whereas the Tayak Apu (President) and the others leaders serve for three years. The People of Sarayaku are masters in the selective use of modern technology (digital mapping of resources, social networks, etc.) without ever losing their cultural identity. If you imagine a utopian vision of the future, which aspects of indigenous wisdom does it include and which aspects of Western knowledge? The impact of any technology depends on human behaviour. If well used, technology can serve to strengthen new processes of collective and organized adaptation. Based on this logic and analysis, the People of Sarayaku have adopted certain tools, such as the internet, which we use to disseminate the processes resistance in defence of our lives; to make known the proposals that come from within the territory and from the deep jungle. The jungle society has always been in a state of interaction, active looking for solutions for threats such as climate change. Historically, it was impossible to make visible Sarayaku's proposals in a dominant, complex world, full of wars and devastating economic conflicts. Now, with these new technologies, we can successfully disseminate communications on history, culture, proposals, visionary projects to conserve and protect the balance of the land and ensure the continuity of the Living Forest. These technologies have also allowed us to safeguard the memories of art, culture and stories, so that future generations can continue learning. At the beginning, stone technologies were inventions that served to advance society in many ways. Today, the machete serves to prepare the land, a shotgun to hunt, the internet to communicate and generate social networks. If badly used these tools become dangerous and violent, like the dollar, but if well used they can support the demand for rights. We believe that it is necessary to face the globalized world without creating a jagged wall because sooner or later that wall would be the end of our history. For us the strategy is to adapt these tools to strengthen the organization. The Sarayaku people are currently facing a double disaster. Just after the pandemic arrived in March, a devastating flood hit the community. Tell us about the impact of the flood. Personally, I had a fortunate escape from the flood. On March 17 of this year, just when the Health Emergency measures were issued, a torrential rain had fallen on the headwaters of the Bobonaza River. That day, I was due to travel to Sarayaku by canoe with a group of 11 people, including children, elderly people and my daughter, Samai. At the Challawayaku port, I found that the Bobonaza River had not grown much, it was navigable. So, I took the decision to set sail at 4:30pm, calculating that I could arrive in Sarayaku after nightfall. However, the canoe’s engine did not start and we had to sleep outside at the port. This turned out to be a fortunate turn of events because, had we managed to set out that day, we would surely have perished. We later discovered that the Bobonaza River had flooded further downstream and a bridge had collapsed, forming a dam-like barrier across the river. In the dark, the canoe would inevitably have crashed heavily against the bridge and sunk. The engine’s failure to start saved all our lives. Several communities in the Bobonaza river basin faced a double disaster due to the health emergency and the flood, among them Sarayaku. The major impact of the flood was on food security, due to the massive destruction of chacras (food gardens), staple crops such as corn and plantain, chicken coops and fish ponds. In Sarayaku, the scene was terrible, truly calamitous. Almost 90% of the population suffered material and psychological damage. More than thirty houses were damaged or destroyed. The river also razed several bridges including the main one that crosses the Bobonaza River, and several educational centres, including the Tayak Wasi (School of the Living Jungle) and the Sasi Wasi (the Centre for Strengthening the Practice of Ancestral Medicine). The Tayak Wasi School of the Living Jungle (also known as the School of Peaceful Resistance) was founded in 1994 to strengthen and teach ancestral knowledge and bilingual intercultural education (in Kichwa and Spanish). A new generation of leaders was trained at the school, where they learned about art, history, knowledge of the forest, philosophy, the Kichwa worldview, and the philosophical thought of the Living Jungle. Sadly, the Tayak Wasi school was washed away by the river on March 17 due to the most severe flooding seen in Sarayaku for 150 years. Now it remains a memory, a symbol of peaceful struggle, of the formation of thought and communion with the Living Jungle. The Sasi Wasi, where we conducted spiritual rituals and studied medicinal and sacred plants and preventive health, was also reduced to rubble. The outlook is bleak and sad. The restoration of these places represents a complex problem. We have decided to relocate them out of the risk zone to safer areas. This will give the State one less reason to refuse to administratively recognize the school, which it has already tried to close for not complying with the official and western teaching model. Tayak Wasi and Sasi Wasi, two visionary projects for the protection of culture, biodiversity and life, are part of an important plan of the Association for the Strengthening of Knowledge & Ancestral Wisdom of Sarayaku (ATAYAK). Within this plan there are two other important axes: the Sacharuya (Botanical Center for the Rescue of Biodiversity and Strengthening of Economic & Food Sovereignty); and the Sisa Ñampi (Living Path of Flowers). WR: How can people in other countries support the Sarayaku struggle? JG: People can support the Sarayaku’s struggle through dissemination and creating communication networks. They can carry our message at world conferences. It is important to denounce the capital of extractive corporations. People can financially support our life projects, such as the Living Path of Flowers and the reconstruction of the Tayak Wasi and Sasi Wasi, which have been born from Sarayaku’s own vision. It is important to identify the life projects of indigenous peoples and support their own solutions, in which they are the principal actor in their own remediation. This support should be offered without imposition, exercising the true model of democracy, recognizing the autonomy and self-determination of these peoples. Global funds should be directed towards the life projects of indigenous peoples, which are ignored by the State and allied organizations, despite Ecuador being constitutionally decreed as a “plurinational State”. Our vision is to establish a territorial indigenous government that breaks the colonial scheme, restores rights and banishes the institutional discrimination and marginalization that exists today. WR: It is possible to make a financial donation to the Sarayaku’s life projects here.

From these defenders, Beth learned that community-led eco-tourism enables them to protect threatened ecosystems and unique ways of life. This inspired her to write Moon Guide to Ecuador & The Galapagos Islands (2019), the first international guidebook on Ecuador with a focus on ethical travel. Beth is part of the Writers Rebel team and is excited by the alchemic possibilities of uniting the two forces that give her the most hope for the future: indigenous nature defenders and Extinction Rebellion. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/11/03/civil-disobedience-examples/,"It’s not enough to believe in something. You have to be ready to stand for something, if you want change. - Edward Snowden The situation looks bleak and it feels like there is nothing you or I can do. This is not a predicament exclusive to our time. History can point us in the direction of those who felt exactly the same. Ordinary people who, constrained by injustice, took action to challenge those who held the power. It is our right, and our moral obligation, to protest over unjust political, economic or social conditions. Many of the rights we take for granted came about as a result of protest—human rights, women’s rights, the rights of workers. It has always been a struggle to bring about change, but it can be achieved. Civil disobedience is the active, non-violent refusal to accept the dictates of governments. It informs them that unjust actions will be opposed and the people will act illegally if pushed to do so. Civil disobedience causes disruption and focuses attention, while forcing debate with the aim of bringing about fundamental and progressive changes within our societies and our world. Acts of civil disobedience do not have to be extreme. We can all be activists. Small actions can lead to larger ones, and can provide inspiration to individuals who may be unsure where to funnel their concerns. This in turn can help lay the pathway to further understanding and global change. These fifteen examples of civil disobedience span almost a century. From the solitary action of a young Montgomery woman to the mass protests of thousands in Scotland and Sudan, every one of these protestors remain united in their demand for justice and call for a better world. Considered the inferior sex, women have no vote, no power and no say in how their world is governed. In the face of injustice, women fight back. The British fight for women’s suffrage (the legal right to vote) included groups from the women’s labour movement and the moderate, non-confrontational National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Believing in civil disobedience, the NUWSS disrupted Parliament, chained themselves to railings, distributed pamphlets and organised demonstrations and lectures. The more militant Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) were prepared to use any tactic necessary. This included often violent, direct action. When arrested, Suffragettes offered further resistance by going on hunger strike. Although Suffragettes are often portrayed as originating from the ruling classes, thousands of brave working class women made huge personal sacrifices for the movement, their punishments often more barbaric than those of higher societal standing. Not all women could afford the sacrifice. Many were breadwinners, or worked long shifts as servants or in factories, returning home to care for children and keep the house. The 1918 Representation of the People Act granted women over the age of 30 the right to vote in Britain. Full suffrage, that is the right to vote over the age of 21, in accordance with male voting, was passed in 1928. The Suffragette victory in Britain followed years of protest, struggle and inconceivable hardship. Each woman chose her role and every role was important. Thirty five years previously, in 1893, the women of New Zealand were first to win the vote. Saudi Arabia granted women suffrage in 2015. Revolution may take decades, but when it eventually comes, it can have an everlasting impact on the course of history. Laws for women—Written and voted for by men. Public Domain. Forced to pay inflated prices for the salt which keeps them alive, thousands of Indians follow one man on the long road to victory and independence. The1882 Salt Act prohibited the people of India, while under British rule, from collecting, producing or selling salt. The poor suffered most as they could not afford to buy the heavily taxed salt, a mineral vital for human metabolism in hot, humid climates. Those who broke the law were imprisoned. Mahatma Gandhi left his ashram in Sabarmati on 12 March 1930 with 78 followers, to be joined by tens of thousands of others along the 240 mile march to the Arabian Sea. By lifting salt from the ground in the coastal town of Dandi on 6th April, he openly defied British law. Gandhi had mobilised the satyagrahi, a philosophy of truth-focused, non-violent non-cooperation. As part of the Civil Disobedience Movement, thousands more followed Gandhi's lead, with salt being made, bought and sold illegally all across India. 60,000 peaceful protestors were arrested, including Gandhi himself, which raised further global awareness of the situation in India. The Salt March and the ensuing Civil Disobedience Movement shook the foundations of the British Empire, while providing a turning point on the road to Indian independence in 1947. It was a simple yet defiant act of civil disobedience by people of conviction and courage, taking a stand against a giant world power. Gandhi collecting salt on the Gujarat coast. April 1930. Public domain. When an African American schoolgirl is ordered to give up her seat to a white woman, the abolitionists provide her with the strength to stay where she is. At the age of 15, schoolgirl Claudette Colvin became the first African American to refuse to give up her seat to a white woman on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Colvin stated she felt the hands of abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth holding her down. She was dragged from the bus and subjected to sexist and racist behaviour before being arrested and held in an adult jail. Following the arrest of Rosa Parks nine months later for the same action, the Women’s Political Council (WPC), a group of black women working for civil rights, circulated 50,000 flyers calling for a boycott of the Montgomery bus system. As news spread of the boycott, African American leaders across Montgomery began to lend their support. From December 5, 1955 to December 20, 1956, approximately 40,000 African Americans refused to travel on Montgomery buses. Although many chose to walk, carpools were organised, with the city’s African American taxi drivers charging the same price as the bus fare for African American riders. The protestors were determined to continue until the city met with their demands, which included the hiring of black bus drivers and a first-come first-seated policy. Ultimately a group of five Montgomery women sued the city in the U.S. District Court, seeking to have the segregation laws totally invalidated. In December 1956, the US Supreme Court declared segregation laws in Alabama to be anti-constitutional (although this did not apply to interstate buses). The legal case, which ended the boycott, was partially built on the testimony of Claudette Colvin. Numerous other mass actions were to follow, including the Freedom Riders of 1961, and The Birmingham Children’s Crusade, 1963, which led to hundreds of protestors being violently attacked, arrested and jailed. It was not until 1964, with Jim Crow laws overturned by the Civil Rights Act, that segregation was banned. Two hundred people turn their back on abuse and move to settle on traditional land. They refuse to leave, demanding the rightful return of the land to the indigenous people. Gurindji tribal elder Vincent Lingiari led two hundred pastoral workers away from the privately owned Wave Hill cattle station in the Northern Territory, as a protest against low pay, poverty and decades of abuse. The ‘Walk Off Mob’ formed a new settlement at Daguragu, refusing an order to vacate. The strike lasted seven years. Lingiari’s continued lobbying of politicians galvanised the strike and gained support from non-indigenous Australians. It was the precursor to lands rights legislation almost ten years later when, in 1975, 3300 square kilometers of Australian land was the first returned to the Gurindji tribe. In 1976, The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was signed, allowing indigenous people to claim traditional and spiritual land. A workers’ rights action resulting in a land rights victory. Four men walk into a bar and ask to be served. Sevice is denied because they are gay — the men risk arrest to ensure their story is reported and shared. In 1966 New York City, serving alcohol to homosexuals was illegal. Under a disorderly conduct statute, city ‘cleanups’ encouraged the closure of bars frequented by gays and the arrest of homosexual customers by way of police entrapment. Many lives were destroyed as a result. Dick Leitsch, a pivotal figure in the fight for gay rights, accompanied by three friends from the Mattachine Society—John Timmins, Randy Wicker and CraigRodwell—entered Julius’ bar in Greenwich Village, declared themselves homosexuals and asked to be served. This is thought to be the first organised act of civil disobedience by gay people. Service was denied and the incident was widely reported in the press. Within a year, New York State courts ended the practice of using gay patronage as an excuse for revoking liquor licences; thus opening the way for licenced gay bars. Leitsch’s further actions were instrumental in putting an end to entrapment while encouraging legal challenges to charges based solely on police testimony. Dick Leitsch, 1966. Photographer unknown. Influenced by the sit-ins at segregated lunch counters by black civil rights protestors, this was a brilliant example of how the non-violent, courteous action of four brave individuals led to societal change and the reframing of public understanding. As a world superpower destroys a tiny island with bombs and bullets, undeterred inhabitants refuse to surrender the fight to reclaim their home. In 1970, Culebra islanders undertook a series of protests against the United States Navy for its use of the island for military training exercises. The Navy expropriated 2000 of the island’s 7000 acres for bombing practice. Homes were torn down, and targets erected. A three mile exclusion zone was set around the island, making prisoners of the island's 700 inhabitants. Little fishing remained and any cattle were grazed on navy owned land. LIFE magazine reported ‘the crunch of 500-pound bombs...the whine of jets, echoing machine gun fire, screaming rockets and the triple-throated boom of naval shells.’ Protestors stated that the bombing missions, which often occurred seven days a week, placed Culebra in a ‘deplorable situation.’ Unwilling to withdraw claims to the whole island, protestors built a chapel in just three days on Flamingo Beach, a restricted, major target area, using only crude tools. US Marshals ordered them to leave but they refused and six people were arrested. Six days later, the navy demolished the chapel. Protesters illegally occupied restricted areas, including Flamingo Beach, remaining there for several weeks. Those who needed new homes squatted on Navy land, which was also used in the creation of sports areas and graveyards. President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party and protest leader, Rubén Berríos, along with thirteen others, was sentenced to three months in a Puerto Rico prison for civil disobedience and trespassing. In 1974, all political parties in Puerto Rico called for the US Navy to cease operations and leave the island. Finally, in 1974, President Nixon ordered the Navy to leave the island, which they did in December 1975. Another example of a few hundred brave people standing firm in the shadow of a world superpower. Timber trail at Pureoa Forest Park, Waikato. Credit: Buffy May A group of friends and activists set up home in the branches of 1000 year old trees, while below them, bulldozers and chainsaws move to destroy the forest. In the 1970s, grassroots environmental groups started focusing their actions on the logging industry in New Zealand. The country had lost two thirds of its native forest cover as a result of logging since the 19th century. New Zealand logging is an industry that still accounts for 1.1% of the world's total supply of industrial wood and 1.3% of the world's trade in forest products. A petition of approximately 350,000 signatures was presented to Parliament, demanding an end to logging and legal recognition of native forests. Despite this, the 1000-year old forests of Pureora were to be logged of all merchantable timber. In the first ever tree-sitting protest, activists Steven King, Shirley Guildford and others from the Native Forest Action Council led the action against the decimation of the Pureora forest. Protestors took action quickly, obtaining camping permits for the forest. They climbed into the canopy of six totara trees and demanded Pureora be spared. Platforms and tree houses were constructed as protestors occupied the area and refused to leave. Some blocked access to the trees with their bodies. This definitive, fast response was vital in that they established themselves before the authorities could respond. The result of the protest was that both the public and government were alerted to the destruction of natural habitats, the loss of biodiversity, and environmental fragility. This was a small act of civil disobedience taken by a few people who knew that bulldozers and chainsaws do not give way to petitions and prolonged debate. It led to a government-imposed logging moratorium and, eventually, the end of native forest logging in the park, with the creation of Pureora Forest Park in 1978. The Treetop protest platform is still accessible today. Students and scientists rise up against the mighty Soviets in a fight to rid their country of exploitative and polluting large-scale mines. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union began exploiting Estonia’s rich phosphorite deposits for the fertiliser industry. During this time the country’s groundwater was contaminated by large-scale fracking (oil shale mining) operations. Hydraulic fracturing fluid, used during gas extraction, is a cocktail of chemicals including biocides, and contaminated ‘flowback’ liquid contains radioactive material. Other toxic compounds are released into the air during fracking and these have been linked to birth defects, neurological problems and cancer. In 1987, a local news programme enlightened the Estonian people to Soviet plans to construct a huge phosphorite mine in Virumaa. The Soviet Estonian leadership had in the past been severely criticised for concealing information and this news unleashed an extensive protest campaign known as The Phosphorite War. At first, Soviet censors silenced the reporting of protestors, but the press gradually shook off the Communist Party’s censorship and supported the people’s resistance to the phosphorite mine. Scientists from the Estonian Academy of Sciences, led by Endel Lippmaa, warned of the contamination of up to 40 percent of Estonia’s water supply. The protest culminated in spring 1987, when brave students from Tartu University organised two peaceful demonstrations. Placards and T-shirts bore the slogan ‘Phosphorite - No Thanks!’ Declarations and newspaper articles were distributed. Estonian musicians joined the protest, singing songs that became symbolic of the struggle. In the autumn of 1987, the Estonian leadership reached an agreement with the mighty Soviet government to halt the construction of the mine. This was the first extensive protest in Soviet Estonia. It encouraged resistance against the Soviet Union and led to the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991. The Phosphorite War was one of the most important milestones in Estonian environmental history. It brought the people of Estonia together with a renewed sense of identity and proved the power of collective action. Most significantly, it unlocked the fetters of fear. ‘Our little republic will not be excavated! Enough playing with us! The outrage is coming!’ Letter written by an Estonian protestor.

The Poll Tax (Community Charge) was introduced in Scotland in 1989, one year before England and Wales. It amounted to a single flat-rate tax on every adult, irrespective of personal income. This resulted in lower income households being compelled to pay more in tax than higher earners. It was widely quoted that the billionaire Duke of Westminster would pay the same tax as his chauffeur. From the day it was implemented, 1st April 1989, the people of Scotland were fiercely opposed to the poll tax, and they fought long and hard to have it abolished. On the 31st March 1990 in Glasgow, 50,000 people marched peacefully through the city centre as part of the city’s poll tax protests. A campaign of organised resistance made it impossible for the councils to enforce the tax, and physically impossible for police to arrest mass defaulters. The blockading of housing estates and private homes from court-appointed sheriffs was a key part of the Scottish struggle. The English and Welsh drew inspiration from Scotland's fight but the outcome was not as peaceful. A London march resulted in the worst riots in the city for over a century with 340 people arrested and 113 injured. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was widely criticised for the political and fiscal disaster, and eventually resigned. Her successor, John Major, replaced the Community Charge with a system of council tax, a local taxation system based on property value. By the end of 1990, an estimated 4 million people had refused to pay their poll tax and many of them spent time in jail. This was a passionate grass roots protest, which brought together people from all parts of society. As with protestors before them, some saw the only choice being resistance, even if that meant assault, arrest and time spent in jail. It was the refusal to pay the tax that paralysed the system from the inside out. The machine was brought to a halt. Poll tax protest. Photographer unknown. Huge corporations seize seeds in a bid to control what we eat. Brave farmers all over the world risk ruination by refusing to accept this. Little victories can be inspirational. As a result of a global legal offensive, farmers who have grown and shared seeds for thousands of years are fast becoming criminalised for their actions. The world’s ten largest seed corporations dominate three quarters of the commercial seed market. Environmental and Agricultural activist Vandana Shiva urges the refusal to recognise unethical laws that rob people of the right to save and exchange seeds. She does this on the basis that those who control the world’s food control the world. In this environment, farmers lose their autonomy. They must purchase seeds determined by seed corporations. Terminator seeds, for example, are genetically modified to become sterile after the first germination. They are expensive and require herbicides and artificial fertilisers all provided, at huge cost, by the corporations. The following year the farmer must purchase more seeds and more fertiliser. Those that are not ruined by inescapable debt become part of a corporate production chain. Agricultural biodiversity is vital given the global challenges the world now faces; new strains of disease, environmental stresses in the face of climate change, and socio-economic challenges. The ability of crops to adapt is the cornerstone of the planet’s survival, yet over the course of the 20th century, according to the FAO, approximately 75% of crop diversity has been lost as a result of privatisation and monoculture—the growing of a single crop on the same land year after year. Resistance against seed privatisation is global. Farmers are developing local seed systems, risking fines and imprisonment for storing and sharing seeds. They are marching, striking, refusing to roll over. They are paying fines and going to jail, and sometimes they win. The victories may seem small but they are monumental for those involved. These farmers might not change the world immediately, but they continue to change their societies, which can and does lead to global change. A French sheep farmer finds a symbolic way to protest against the influx of multinationals by taking apart a McDonald’s, one brick at a time. In 1999, José Bové, along with 300 collaborators, dismantled a half-built McDonald’s in Millau (Aveyron). This was a symbolic action to protest against globalisation and the loss of food sovereignty to multinationals—that is the right to healthy, diverse and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods. It was an action taken, not only on behalf of traditional French producers, but for those from all over the world. Bové’s action created an army of agricultural activists and was part of a wider protest aimed at disrupting the influx into Europe of genetically modified crops and monoculture. On the day of his trial in Millau, Bové arrived in an oxcart, a large wheel of Roquefort cheese held aloft. Later, dressed as a criminal to start his three month sentence, Bové was applauded by hundreds of supporters as he made the six hour journey to prison at the head of a convoy of tractors. Bové used non-violent civil disobedience to call attention to injustices, and by spending time in jail won the support of thousands. He tapped into deep fears about the safety of the food supply in France, identifying and challenging what many considered a threat to French cultural identity. This sheep farmer activist inspired an international protest movement that included Confederation Paysanne, the Associations for the Maintenance of Peasant Agriculture and La Via Campesina, the international peasants movement. These organisations continue to demand protection for human rights, including the right to control the supply and safety of one's food. Bové was at the forefront of the successful movement against GMOs being grown in France and Europe. (Spain and Portugal are the only European countries who grow GMO crops). He served as a Member of the European Parliament with the European Greens from 2009 - 2019. Seville 2012. Photo: author. People take back the power to fight evictions as the government and banks do nothing to help an increasingly desolate population. Around 250,000 seizure orders were served on Spanish properties between 2008 and 2012. In 2013, there were an average of 184 evictions per day. Anti-eviction organisations, such as the Platform of People Affected by Mortgages (PAH), were formed in reaction to the Spanish Government's failure to uphold the constitutional right for all Spaniards to enjoy stable and affordable housing. The PAH aimed to prevent the systematic eviction of tens of thousands of debtors across Spain and to turn mortgaged homes into affordable rental properties while reforming the Mortgage Act, which previously granted banks the right to claim full payment of debt, even after evicting a property's residents. The strength of this movement was based on its very broad social foundation. Weekly meetings empowered the people by sharing knowledge and experience of the eviction process. The PAH could call on dozens of protestors to gather at short notice, blocking entrances to properties where eviction orders were being delivered. The PAH re-occupied empty housing owned by banks to provide shelter for evicted families. Eight months after the start of the collective occupation, 20 housing blocks were occupied, sheltering 1049 people. These methods of political activism gained widespread legitimacy. Spanish banks had been bailed out with public funds. The PAH, and their followers, saw this not as illegal occupation but legitimate recuperation. Along with highly organised demonstrations, manifestos and interaction with the media and public institutions, the PAH took part in controversial ‘escraches’-- protests staged outside the homes of politicians and the European Court of Justice, demanding changes to Spanish mortgage legislation. The anti-eviction campaign challenged the rhetoric of the state, the banks, and property developers. The protests struck at the very core of Spain’s power structure in challenging forms of expropriation by state-backed private finance. In 2013, The European Court of Justice declared support for the People’s Legislative Initiative – drafted by the PAH movement. This obliged the Spanish government to modify the Mortgage Law and Civil Procedure to adjust the imbalance between creditor and individual debtor. One man loses his freedom to expose what our governments are up to—watching and listening, collecting our data to manipulate and control us. Edward Snowden, cybersecurity expert, copied and handed over a vast cache of close to ten thousand highly classified documents taken from the National Security Agency (NSA) when employed as a contractor with Booz Allen Hamilton. When his concerns of unethical practice were dismissed, Snowden blew the whistle on secret details of surveillance programs conducted by the United States government (with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European Governments). His objective was to alert the world to widespread, unconstitutional surveillance and invasions of privacy, suggesting that if the governments will not represent the public interests, it is up to the public to champion them. The Snowden leaks inspired five years of technological change within Silicon Valley tech giants, keen to regain their users' trust. Apple was the first to adjust its privacy policy and encryption and security practices. The Snowden leaks didn't put an end to government surveillance. The fight against violation of privacy and the harvesting of data continue, but Snowden’s actions sparked a cultural shift, raising awareness of government infraction. They prompted a cultural discussion about government infringement of civil liberties. Having received death threats and branded a traitor by many, Snowden still lives in exile in Moscow. Edward Snowden was one person taking action to expose, with great bravery and potential danger to himself, an injustice that affected us all. After decades of living under a brutal dictatorship, the Sudanese people rise up in a campaign of disobedience and resistance. It is a hard fight. On 11th April 2019, a pro-democratic, non-violent civil uprising involving thousands of Sudanese people overthrew the most brutal of dictators, Omar al-Bashir. His 30 year rule, supported by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, decimated the economy, split society and placed barbaric controls on women. Starting in the provinces in reaction to rising living costs, the uprising soon moved to the capital, Khartoum. North and south came together, regardless of class, ethnicity or religious belief in defiance of the regime. The country’s young professionals were at the forefront of the insurrection, with women encouraging other women to join them in their demand for freedom. Restaurants, banks and businesses were closed down. The streets became desolate. There were eight months of strikes and demonstrations calling for democracy, the dissolution of the National Congress Party (NCP), human rights, economic reforms and the repeal of the public order law, designed to exclude and intimidate women from actively participating in public life. Once Bashir was ousted, the Transitional Military Council (TMC) took charge and it soon became clear that it was not willing to give up power. On 3rd June, following weeks of peaceful celebration, the Rapid Support Forces opened fire on protestors who were holding a prolonged sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum. The internet was closed down to suppress sharing of information. Hundreds were killed and raped, in a bid to break the revolution by traumatising its supporters. The people didn't give up. Two weeks after the massacre, the youth reorganised, calling for sustained civil disobedience and non-violent resistance, claiming they would not stop until authority was transferred to a liberal civilian administration. On 17th July, the TMC and civilian protestors represented by the Forces of Freedom and Change, signed a power sharing agreement. President Macron—France’s youngest head of state since Napoleon Bonaparte—is served some grassroots revolution by a discontent and angry population. The Gilet Jaune (Yellow Vest) protest came about as a reaction to changes in labour laws, in particular a rise in fuel taxes, but grew to demand social and economic justice. Organised via social media, through colère (anger) groups, the people of France came together in solidarity, irrespective of political and social backgrounds. Following the tax cuts for France’s millionaires in 2017, fiscal demands on struggling middle classes had increased, while rural populations faced high unemployment levels and further economic downturn. Cuts in public transport services across France left much of the population reliant on cars. Rural populations, including those who had been priced out of living in the big cities, struggled to survive. Gilet Jaune road block. Photographer unknown. In October 2018, truck driver Eric Drouet called on the people of France to block their local roads on 17 November. The aim was to obstruct traffic in order to get the government’s attention. Approximately 290,000 people took part. Every French motorist is obliged to carry a high-viz jacket—un gilet jaune—in their vehicle. These ubiquitous garments became the symbol of protest as drivers displayed them on dashboards, hung them from windows and emblazoned them with protest slogans. The power of the yellow vest lay in the support of the population. Within a month, polls showed over half the country agreed with the protest. Although built on peaceful, civil disobedience such as road blocks and building temporary camps on roundabouts, the yellow vest protests led to some of the worst civil disorder France has seen. Even though the majority of protestors distanced themselves from the violent elements of the movement, the French authorities were accused of disproportionate use of force. After four weeks of disruption, and in a significant U-turn, President Macron was forced to make concessions including the cancellation of the fuel tax, while launching The Great National Debate inviting citizens to express their concerns and hopes regarding French politics. Civil disobedience does not equate to disregard for the law. What lies at its heart is the separation between the legal and the legitimate. It is used when traditional methods of protest, such as petitioning, lobbying, marching, voting and orderly, compliant demonstration have failed. As for Extinction Rebellion, our strategy is one of civil disobedience grounded in non-violent disruption. There will be occasions when the state will choose to react with force, but to resort to the same tactics as those we seek to change is to abandon our moral compass. Extinction Rebellion will continue to protest in the fight to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse. Rebels refuse to sit idly by and watch grave injustices unfold. The struggle is one of survival. We are building an inclusive, participatory movement for change—one grown from grassroots campaigning on the streets and in homes, schools and workplaces, throughout the web and across the planet, with over 1146 groups in 72 countries.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/10/10/monterey-bay/,"Monterey Bay, USA by Ilse Orsel, Unsplash Do you ever lie awake in the middle of the night wondering, “I’m just one not-particularly-powerful person. Can one person really make a difference in the climate change fight? Everything I read says we’re doomed. Should I just give up?” Don’t underestimate your importance to this fight. Here’s the story of how a few individuals confronted an environmental disaster and worked to transform it into an ecological treasure. In 1931, Monterey Bay was a sewer, and it seemed impossible that it could ever improve. The once-plentiful sea otters, that locals and explorers had pursued for their fur, were presumed extinct; the crowds of whales that sailors had once hunted were gone; the giant kelp forests were a long-vanished memory. Even the abalone that had sustained the Native American population in the area had nearly vanished. Humans had wiped out one sea creature after another over the past two centuries in the name of commerce. But they had one fish left that was seemingly inexhaustible: sardines. The coastline of the city of Monterey was lined with sardine canneries that dumped their foul-smelling waste into Monterey Bay, adding to the ecological devastation begun by previous marine industries. Marine scientist (and college dropout) Ed Ricketts, who provided the inspiration for the character Doc in John Steinbeck’s Cannery Row, warned that the serial eradication of species would cause the entire ecosystem to collapse, the sardines to vanish, and the economy of the communities around Monterey Bay to be destroyed. He told the industry to restrict fishing in order to give the sardines time to recover. No one in the fishing industry listened. However, there were a few people who refused to give up on Monterey Bay. One of them, marine biologist Julia Platt, had been fighting for decades to fix the ecological issues of Monterey Bay. In 1899 she moved to Pacific Grove, a photogenic seaside hamlet next to the canning city of Monterey. Pacific Grove had begun as a summer seaside campground for Methodists, but the pollution made the beaches unusable and the smell wafting from Monterey made conditions almost unlivable. A doctor of marine biology may sound powerful to us, but the sexism of Platt’s day and the economic power of her opponents meant her title didn’t give her an advantage. As Platt spent the next 36 years working to create change, she discovered she needed to build a foundation for that change. She rewrote Pacific Grove’s charter, mandating the town’s stewardship over the sea that was within its borders and laying out a government infrastructure that is used to this day. It was unglamorous, arduous work that required persistence and a willingness to deal with the details – and without it, the Bay might never have come back to health. But Platt was not above PR stunts. She knew that in order to save Monterey Bay, she would need a position of political power – and to acquire that, she needed to do something that would get town residents on her side. A local landowner had built a fence that blocked off access to the beach; the 74-year-old Platt took an axe to the fence and destroyed it in order to provide town residents coastal access. Platt then ran for mayor – and won in a landslide, a notable thing for an elderly woman in 1931. She knew she could not shut down the economically powerful canneries, but she found ways to push back. She used her position to convince the California legislature to create some of the first marine sanctuaries in the world, along the coastline right off Pacific Grove. This gave her the leverage she needed to sue the canneries and stop their most egregious violations, and gave marine species a protected area that would become key to their survival. But she died in 1935, long before she got to see the true results of her work. Julia Platt, from the University of Vermont Archives Ed Ricketts had written a book about the interconnectedness of marine ecology called “Between Pacific Tides.” He understood deeply that no marine species existed in isolation. However, he and Platt did not collaborate; Ricketts sold marine species samples in order to make a living, which Platt abhorred and tried to shut down. In the late 1940s, the sardine fisheries that the canneries depended on collapsed, just as Ed Ricketts had predicted. Once the fish had vanished, the canneries vanished too. Ricketts was not above an I-told-you-so. ''If conservation had been adopted early enough,'' Ricketts wrote in 1948, shortly before his death, ''a smaller but streamlined Cannery Row in all likelihood this month would be winding up a fairly successful season, instead of dipping as they must be now, deeply into the red ink of failure.'' For a while, it seemed like the story would end there, with Monterey Bay a near-lifeless sewage sink. The pollution was so bad it made lead paint turn black. But the efforts by Platt and Ricketts had started to have small effects, which grew as commerce died. Another important factor: the Packard family (of the Hewlett-Packard Corporation) donated $50 million to create an aquarium where one of the canneries had been. If you’ve ever seen the “Cetacean Institute” in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, that’s the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The Packards were driven to create the Aquarium after the massive Santa Barbara oil spill a few hundred miles down the coast in 1969. Family scion Nancy Packard Burnett and three of her friends realized that in order to protect the Bay it was important to show the public why it needed to be protected. But even with millions of dollars, it took years of perseverance to make the dream happen. When the Aquarium was constructed, it took a different focus than the aquarium model at the time. Most aquariums displayed sea life from far away. The Monterey Bay Aquarium was focused on bringing users up close with the sea life just outside its windows. People were skeptical of this idea when it opened in 1984, but with two million visitors in the first year it was a much bigger success than expected, and brought more people on board with the mission of rescuing Monterey Bay. The Aquarium developed a number of ways to support the renewal of Monterey Bay. One of the key elements was a baby sea otter rescue program. Sea otters aren’t just adorable; they cause kelp to thrive by eating sea urchins that otherwise devour every last speck of seaweed. Sea otters had come back, to a limited extent, from a small group in a hidden cove in Big Sur. But sea otter pups were dying when stranded, and no one knew how to rescue them. The Aquarium began a program to rescue the pups, and learned how to nurse them back to health and re-release them into the wild. A recent genetic survey of the abundant sea otters in Monterey Bay’s Elkhorn Slough revealed that 60% of those otters are descended from otters rescued by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The work started by Julia Platt and Ed Ricketts decades before finally paid off, though they were not there to see it. In 1992, Monterey Bay was designated a National Marine Sanctuary. This added even further protections, preventing ships from dumping waste into the bay and requiring towns in the regions to protect the waters. Sea Otters, Wikimedia These efforts have also diversified the economy. Monterey Bay has now become a “marine policy laboratory” where strategies for environmental renewal are tested before being launched on a broader scale. Scientific research has become an economic engine for the area, with 27 marine science organizations and five marine technology organizations members of the Monterey Bay Crescent Ocean Research Consortium. Coastal towns are bouncing back due to a mix of ecotourism, science, fishing and other industries. By focusing on multiple industries, the region has ensured that a downturn in one area won’t devastate the entire economy. The fishing industry still exists in Monterey Bay, but fishermen have strict limits as to what they can catch. Because of the collapse of various fish species, buyers have been looking elsewhere for their fish. The fishing industry is now working to brand the fish they catch as both exotic (as many have not been sold for years) and environmentally sensitive, and create a market where they can be sold at a premium. Tourism has grown around the Bay, and sports that allow people to interact with nature, from kayaking to stand up paddleboarding to diving, all take place in Monterey Bay. The idea of Monterey Bay as a site for whale watching was laughable in the 1940s, and even in the 1990s they were only seen a few times a year. Now whale watching boats go out every day and usually spot something. And it’s not unusual for the whales to come to the tourists, as kakakers have learned several times! Until 2013, it seemed that nothing could stop the recovery of Monterey Bay. Then, because of Pacific Ocean warming, new threats appeared. The ocean warming made sea stars more susceptible to wasting disease. With fewer sea stars to devour the sea urchins, there were far more sea urchins around to devour kelp forests right at the root. And because of the warming ocean, kelp forests couldn’t get enough nutrients and were already beginning to thin. The situation bears out Ed Ricketts’ theory of the interconnection of life in Monterey Bay. The follow-on effects of the loss of kelp forests are huge. Otters live in kelp forests; without them the population is likely to decline. Kelp forests protect beaches from erosion. They’re also very efficient at carbon sequestration. The demise of the kelp forests could wipe out the hard work done by Platt, Ricketts, Packard, and so many others. The people most responsible for the renewal of Monterey Bay didn’t live to see what it would become. But they spent decades doing the hard work that future generations could build on. Now it’s time for us to pick up their mantle and do what we can to halt climate change and protect their efforts. If a few eco-warriors of yesterday could turn Monterey Bay from a sewer into a sanctuary, there’s no telling what the people of Extinction Rebellion could do for planet Earth. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

The Austrian Rebellion kicked-off with an energising Rebel Ride, despite the police trying to shut it down by banning the use of the motorway. Like water, the 80 riders simply took another route to the opening rally in Sigmund Freud Park! The ‘Honeycomb Campaign’ saw rebels swarm the city’s main square, Michaelerplatz, and establish hexagonal lock-on formations and hexagonal blockades on key roads in reference to our third demand of Citizens Assemblies. Genius! XR Austria Protestor polygons pepper Platz Socially distanced die-ins, amazing Discobedience dance moves, beautiful music, and a lecture by Esteban, a scientist and environmental activist persecuted in South America, were featured too. The police even stood up against hate messages and calls for violence against non-violent rebels! The final rally at Maria-Theresien-Platz marked a ceremonial hand-over to XR Germany, Italy, and Spain for the next waves of the Rebellion. 26 SEPT | Prague, Czech Republic The Protestor’s New Clothes. Four rebels bared all on Prague's luxurious Příkopa Street to protest fast fashion. The rebels glued themselves to the inside of a shop window completely naked except for signs with messages like ‘Fast fashion kills, I'd rather be naked’. Other rebels draped a banner outside the shop that read: ‘There is no economic growth on a dead planet’. Police ripped the rebels from the glass and shut down the store, apparently to “protect the public” from the peaceful protest. Shoppers in Prague were greeted by a bold message. One rebel said: ""Fast fashion is the second most polluting industry in the world, responsible for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. “By buying fast fashion, we accept that the quality of human life is less important than cheap clothing. Gigantic companies that use the fast fashion model literally benefit from modern-day slaves, and privileged Europeans allow this because they also benefit.” 25 SEP | Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, Cape Town, Johannesburg, South Africa Rebels march with other activist groups through Pretoria. Photo: Shiraaz Mohamed. In cities across South Africa, rebels took to the streets with a coalition of activist groups to mark the 6th Global Climate Strike, a day of worldwide climate protest called for by Fridays for Future. Rebels in Mandela Bay organised a coalition march to the City Hall of Port Elizabeth, where they protested against the city’s continuing water crisis. The region is suffering prolonged droughts made worse by neglected local infrastructure and political inaction on the climate crisis. Many residents do not have access to even basic sanitation. The activists called on the mayor to reject plans for a costly and polluting desalination plant and instead solve the water crisis with a climate jobs programme and green infrastructure. Mandela Bay rebels assemble for a day of marching In Pretoria, the activist coalition marched to the Department of Mineral Resources and handed over a memorandum demanding a green restructuring of national electricity provider Eskom, and an end to government promotion of fossil fuels. Activists also braved heavy rains in Cape Town to rally outside Parliament, where they demanded an immediate transition to renewables and an end to coal power. This week rebels in Johannesburg will demonstrate against Standard Bank for their funding of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, which will link Ugandan oil fields to ports in Tanzania. The 900-mile heated pipeline has a carbon footprint equivalent to Denmark’s and will devastate local wildlife as well as small farmers. 3 OCT | Helsinki, Finland Rebels in Helsinki were pepper sprayed by police and stopped from washing their eyes during an ‘Emergency Brake’ blockade in the city centre. Police also detained 49 peaceful demonstrators, including pensioners, children, teachers and nurses. The protest, part of XR Finland’s Autumn Rebellion week, involved blockading Unioninkatu, a major street in central Helsinki. Around 200 rebels decorated the area with flags and banners, a small yellow boat sailed in with “Tell the Truth” on its sail, and people danced to live music. But when their order to leave was ignored, police came in hard, dismantling the blockade and carrying protestors into police vans. When rebels moved to a nearby intersection and sat down to block traffic, police started pepper spraying them at point blank range. 10 protestors suffered serious effects and many more were forced to take off their face masks to breathe, ruining rebel attempts to adhere to Covid-19 safety measures. Police even stopped some rebels from washing their eyes with water. All detainees were eventually released, and XR Finland has condemned the violent police response. Their Autumn Rebellion week will continue as planned until Wednesday. Some rebels were stopped from washing the pepper spray from their eyes. 21-25 SEP | Bern, Switzerland Signposting rebels around camp and government towards a just green transition. Photo: Climatestrike Switzerland XR Switzerland joined the September Rebellion wave with Rise Up For Change, their first ever mass action. Around 400 protestors from XR, Climate Strike Switzerland, Greenpeace and other allied groups gathered at 4:30am on Monday morning to set up camp in Bern’s Bundesplatz (Federal Square). They occupied the square for nearly 48 hours before police forced a cold and rainy evacuation that dragged on for 6 more hours. At the camp, rebels held their own Citizens’ Assemblies, debates, conferences, and talks, while choirs and nighttime concerts kept spirits high.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/09/21/ethical-banks/,"Plant trees. Get arrested. Stop eating meat. Say no to plastic. Abseil down a government building in a bumble bee costume. Close a road with a broken caravan and two tambourines. There are many ways to fight for climate justice, but each of us possesses a powerful, often-forgotten weapon: our money. Is your bank funding climate chaos right now? How do you switch to an ethical bank? Find out here. Jp Valery, Unsplash When was the last time you considered what banks are for? I haven’t deeply thought about it since I opened my first-ever bank account as a child. Banks offer an alternative to keeping your cash hidden in the freezer. Great! Banks reward you for storing your money with them by paying you interest. Great! Banks invest in thousands of projects and loan your money to others. Great? Not always... In February, I read an article by The Guardian called 50 Simple Ways To Make Your Life Greener. The British journalist Donna Ferguson writes in this article that ‘nearly £150 billion [British pounds] has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016’. A massive number of bank account holders in the UK (my home country) have loaned almost ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION POUNDS to the fossil fuels industry in the past four years. And that’s just the UK. Ashim D’Silva, Unsplash California’s Rainforest Action Network (RAN) reports on the investment activities of banks, globally. Since 2009, RAN has published the annual Banking on Climate Change report, in collaboration with the Indigenous Environmental Network (USA), Oil Change International (USA), Reclaim Finance (France), Sierra Club (USA) and BankTrack (The Netherlands). In 2020, Banking on Climate Change concluded that banks’ support for fossil fuels is rising. According to the report, the world’s top 35 fossil fuel financers are based in either Canada, China, Europe, Japan or the USA. Here are the top ten, ranked by how much each has invested in fossil fuels since late 2015. This date is used because that’s when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s Paris Agreement commenced: To make it as globally relevant as possible, Banking on Climate Change looks at the world’s top 20 commercial and investment banks according to asset-size. An additional 16 banks from the world’s top 60 are included, which are selected due to their major presence in key parts of the world. I talked to RAN spokesperson Laurel Sutherlin about the purpose of Banking on Climate Change: ‘This report makes it clear which institutions are most responsible for endangering our collective future. We hope readers will use this information as a tool and join the growing international movement mobilizing people and piling pressure on the financial sector to stop funneling hundreds of billions of dollars into the fossil fuel industry. ‘In particular, we hope people will lend their support and solidarity to the many Indigenous and community-led resistance efforts directly confronting the human impact of big banks' investment decisions. For example, the campaigns to stop projects concerning the Line 3, Keystone XL and Coastal GasLink pipelines in the US, or the exploitation of Indigenous territories in the Amazon.’ By investing in or lending money to the fossil fuels industry, these unethical banks are funding the continued mining and burning of oil, coal and gas. When these materials are burned, they release greenhouse gases that steadily increase temperatures on earth. These temperature increases lead to drought, floods, extreme weather and more. For anybody who is concerned about the climate crisis, RAN’s report is incredibly bad news. Etienne Martin, Unsplash So, what power do we have to reduce fossil fuel financing? As consumers living in capitalist societies, we have almost all the power – but we’ve given It away. It is up to us to rediscover our power and harness it for good causes. I spoke to Ernst-Jan Kuiper, a Climate Campaigner at BankTrack (and the national representative for Extinction Rebellion Netherlands) who is an expert in ethical banking matters: ‘In almost every western country, consumers can switch to an ethical bank. Banks do not have a legal obligation to tell their customers how they make investments or who they finance. However, they could be much more open than they are, as we can see from some ethical banks that publish full details of all their business customers.’ A bank’s power lies in having financial knowledge and expertise that we do not. Banks can make this topic confusing and it benefits them to do so. Luckily, Ernst also has some brilliant clarity to offer amongst this maze of confusion: ‘If a bank does not clearly state that it does not finance the fossil fuel industry, then you can assume that it does.’ This advice is golden and I urge you to remember it. Ryoji Iwata, Unsplash I have mentioned some already, but there are many online tools and campaign groups that might provide information about your bank. Perhaps the most useful we have come across is Bank.Green, which curates the research of several other organisations who work tirelessly to uncover banks' financing activities. You could also talk directly to your bank. My bank in England is NatWest, so I checked its website. I couldn’t find anything there that helped me to understand what happens to my money, so I called the NatWest customer service line: Me: Hello, I would like to know what NatWest is doing with my money. NatWest: Hello. What do you mean? Me: I have money in several accounts with you, which you use to invest and lend to companies and projects. Is that right? NW: …yes, that’s right. Me: I would like to know what those companies and projects are, so that I can understand what my money is being used for. NW: Ok… please hold while I try to find out who to transfer you to… This phone call was difficult, presumably because NatWest (and probably a lot of banks) does not get asked questions like this by its customers. Talking directly to your bank about this subject is complicated, but at least they will know that you are concerned – and that’s a fantastic way to speed up the change that we all desperately need. Do you feel silly asking your bank what they are doing with your money? That’s totally normal! I felt quite silly. But without our money, banks simply would not exist. They serve us, so they should answer our questions. In my case, NatWest eventually asked me to email its Communications and Corporate Affairs department. This is the email I sent: Dear XXX, Thank you for your time on the phone earlier today. I have been a NatWest account holder for most of my life and I recently realised that I don't know what NatWest uses my money for. I would like to know, but I'm struggling to find information about it on the NatWest website. Can you please tell me what NatWest uses my money for? Yours sincerely, Neil This began a long but informative email conversation with NatWest, which is excellent. The information NatWest shared with me included its annual report, as well as links to many other documents. I am not an expert and this information was confusing at first, so I chatted about it with a friend who works in finance. If you know anybody with knowledge of the banking industry, talk to them. You will learn a lot and knowledge is power. Johannes Plenio, Unsplash Many banks are now making a big effort to be ‘green’ and ‘sustainable’, which is a distraction from the purposes of this article: you simply want to know if your bank is using your money to fund activities that contribute to the climate crisis. Here are some examples of the distraction tactics that NatWest’s Communications and Corporate Affairs department used while we were emailing each other: We don't publish a list of all the companies we lend money to, however we do publish our Environmental, Social and Ethical policies, which clarify Prohibited and Restricted areas of lending across a number of sectors NatWest will provide an additional £20bn in funding and financing for Climate and Sustainable finance between now and 2022 We are making our own operations net carbon zero in 2020 and climate positive by 2025 Twenty billion pounds in funding and finance for ‘climate and sustainable finance’ by 2022 and net carbon zero operations by 2020 are both good policies. But if my bank is also pumping billions of pounds into gas, oil and coal, it is still financing the climate crisis. In general, be wary of the term ‘sustainable’. For example, a sustainable bank could say ‘we are sustainable because we recycle all of our waste and use solar energy to power our offices’. If that bank is also helping others to extract fossil fuels however, it might as well put its solar panels in a cave on the moon. ‘Ethical’ can be a more reliable term, especially when investigating banks. When you begin talking to your bank about this, I advise saying nothing about the climate crisis or fossil fuels. You simply want to know which sectors your bank is financing with your money. When I first called NatWest, I mentioned the climate crisis. I really regretted saying this, because they simply began trying to distract me with their environmentally-friendly activities. I think banks would like their customers to be confused about these matters. If you’re confused, it’s more difficult to challenge your bank. I know NatWest is much, much better than some banks, but the environment is certainly not one of its primary concerns. For example: NatWest will stop lending to and underwriting companies with more than 15% of activities related to coal, unless they have a credible transition plan in line with 2015 Paris Agreement by end of 2021; full phase-out from coal by 2030. NatWest will stop lending to and underwriting major oil and gas producers unless they have a credible transition plan in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement by the end of 2021. After several phone conversations and two long and complicated emails, these extracts show NatWest finally telling me that it lends money to the fossil fuels industry. Not only that, but NatWest is not in a very big hurry to stop this lending. I finally have a partial answer to my original question. I don’t think NatWest is an ethical bank. Whether or not you are satisfied with your bank’s activities is completely your decision. I hope I have shown that there are many things to consider and there are no simple answers. If you do decide to find a more ethical bank and move your money, it can be quite challenging, depending on where you live. For example, I am temporarily living in Australia and I needed to open a bank account. I used campaign group Market Forces’ step-by-step guide to find Australia Bank. On its website, Australia Bank clearly states that: We're working to create a healthier planet by refusing to put money into the fossil fuel industry. It's an important part of what makes us a responsible bank, and why we're recommended by fossil fuel divestment advocate Market Forces as a green banking alternative. Simple! Unfortunately, it was difficult to find similar banking solutions for many other countries. That does not mean that there are no solutions in your local area, but you will need to do some research. Here are some leads, ideas and inspiration to help you find an ethical bank: https://bank.green/sustainable-ethical-banks Again, Bank.Green comes up trumps here, with a tool allowing you to choose your location that then displays 3 of the top sustainable banks in your country. www.gabv.org The Global Alliance for Banking on Values represents 62 financial institutions and 16 strategic partners in Asia, Africa, Australia, Latin America, North America and Europe Each member is committed to delivering sustainable economic, social and environmental development through finance www.greenamerica.org/getabetterbank A location-based ethical banking tool for consumers in the USA www.ethicalconsumer.org This UK-based news source, campaign group and magazine publisher has been showing consumers how to make ethical choices since 1989. Its annual subscription costs £29.95, but you’ll receive lots of resources in return Dominik Vanyi, Unsplash Market Forces – the Australian campaign group that I mentioned earlier – does a brilliant job of explaining why this final step is also the most important step: If your bank doesn’t know why you’re closing your account and taking your money elsewhere, they can’t be expected to know how they need to change. Contact them before you start the bank switching process to let them know why you’re unhappy about their support of the fossil fuel industry. When they write back, keep up the dialogue – it only helps to emphasise that you care about the issue. Throughout the process, and when you leave the bank, contact them again to remind them why. The more that customers speak up, the more the bank will be convinced that it is not worth lending to fossil fuels anymore. If you are already talking to your bank (like I was with Natwest), remember to tell them that you’re leaving and why. Try to make sure that your reasons for leaving are recorded somewhere official and in writing. For example, ask to leave a complaint, state your reasons clearly in a letter or an email, or perhaps ask to speak to a senior member of staff on the phone. It is very important to make sure that the most powerful people at your bank receive your message. If, however, you already know that you want to switch banks and don’t need to talk to your old bank about its activities, don’t forget to tell them why you are leaving before you do. Market Forces has excellent resources to guide you through the process of moving to an ethical bank, including this letter/email template that you could send to your old bank. Even though I’ve included this template, please know that an original letter you’ve written yourself will always make a bigger impact. Companies develop workable strategies to deal with a wave of template letters, but these strategies cannot be applied to original letters. So if you can, take this letter as inspiration then write your own, because it will be more time-consuming for your banks and there make a bigger impact: To the Sustainability Manager, I am writing to ensure you are aware of why I have decided to close my bank accounts and leave your bank. I have become aware of the extent to which your bank is involved with financing fossil fuel projects. Coal and gas are driving an array of unacceptable environmental risks. I don’t want my money helping an institution that is funding such destruction, especially when there is a wealth of clean, renewable energy alternatives available. I also consider it an economic risk to retain my money with your bank. There is a growing awareness of the fact that fossil fuel assets will become risky investments as the world moves to combat climate change. I do not want my money with a bank that is investing in assets that may soon become stranded, and investing in companies whose value may plummet as the world turns away from fossil fuels. I am moving my money to ensure my own finances do not support an industry that is polluting the environment, and I hope my action will also make your bank reconsider future investments in the fossil fuel sector. I hope you do not have to receive too many more letters like mine before you realise that investing in fossil fuels is no longer morally responsible or financially viable. If there is anything you would like to say directly in relation to this letter, you are welcome to write back to me. Yours sincerely, XXXX You can find Market Forces’ full, step-by-step guide to switching your bank at www.marketforces.org.au/info/switch-banks. Here is a brief rundown of the steps: Monjur Hasan, Unsplash Stopping airport expansion, campaigning for renewable energy, or protesting governments that accept donations from fossil fuel companies are all worthy and essential causes. They are also all time-consuming and incredibly challenging. Challenging or even changing your bank, however, is a simpler activity – and each of us can make a massive difference by joining in. Here’s a recap of those steps to challenging and changing your bank: Extinction Rebellion has proved that people power can change conversations, priorities and policies.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/09/10/newsletter-43/,"Dear rebels, A global wave of (rock and) rolling rebellions is upon us. With immense courage, cunning and care, rebels are returning to the streets in a dozen countries all across the globe. As we all know, it’s been a strange and tough few months, and a huge amount of thought and discussion has gone into the decision to return to the streets. Despite our cheerful tone, rebellion is not something we do lightly or without considering the consequences. On the contrary, consequence is something we take very seriously. Swedish rebels showing us how it’s done, with their exemplary social-distanced, colourful Rebellion.

Support the Rebellion 7 SEP | Lysekil, Sweden XR Sweden made a magnificent start to this season’s wave of rebellions! After many weeks of preparations, the weekend opened with an unforgettable pink elk and roadblocks on bridges outside the parliament. The elk in question. From then, things got going fast. Rebels brought fake oil and a message of truth to the HQ of Preemraff, a massive oil refinery planning ecocidal expansions. At the same time, rebels on Vasa bridge kept the spotlight fixed on ‘Preem’ with a vividly symbolic oil-pouring action. Police cleared Vasa down to the very last rebel - only to find a joyous new roadblock had popped up on another bridge! This bridge was also cleared at length and then - you guessed it - rebels reappeared again, now more numerous than ever, on a major road in Stockholm’s centre, keeping Kungsgatan free of cars and filled with song for hours! The following morning things got more political, with a blockade of Parliament. Singing, flags and glue kept spirits high, despite the rain. When police finally dispersed the action outside Parliament, rebels reappeared once again, this time back at Kungsgatan, before moving onto swarming in the evening. To wrap things up, the final day saw rebels march en (socially-distanced) masse. The energy was lively, despite police attempts to clamp down using covid legislation. Stockholm’s rebellion had gone brilliantly, and generated massive online reach. For a video-roundup of the weekend see here, and for photos see here. But XR Sweden wasn’t done with Preem! Just yesterday, four brave rebels blocked the entrance to the Preem refinery in Lysekil by locking themselves to two barrels, once again securing national media coverage in cooperation with the local Stoppa Preemraff campaign. And today, rebels in Stockholm followed up outside the parliament. Whatever happens with oil refineries, it looks like XR Sweden won’t be short of energy any time soon! 4 SEP - Ongoing | Poland Dozens of XR Polska rebels rounded off the third day of Polish Rebellion actions by blocking Świętokrzyska and Marszałkowska Streets in the centre of Warsaw, with some rebels glueing themselves to tyres weighted with concrete. A young Polish rebel being taken away by police in Warsaw The police gathered quickly. Several young rebels were detained, but were accompanied by lawyers who ensured their civil rights were respected. XR negotiators de-escalated conflicts between rebels and angry members of the public, some of whom labeled the protestors eco-terrorists. In the words of one rebel: “In the past, to be a terrorist you had to hijack a plane, shoot people, plant a bomb. Today -- you just make someone late for work.” Poland’s ‘fala rebelii’ - wave of rebellion. Rebels are demanding Poland acts immediately and declares a climate emergency, saying that if the government won’t sound the alarm, they will. XR Polska's message is that the facts are clear. Social dialogue is no longer an option in Poland, civil disobedience is the only way to bring about change. 7 SEP | New York, USA Photo: James Messerschmidt In New York City, rebels kicked off the day with a ceremony held at The Bethesda Fountain in Central Park in solidarity with Refuse Fascism NYC and Defend Democracy in Brazil. A climate ribbon was created as an arts ritual to grieve what each of us stands to lose to climate chaos and to affirm our solidarity as we unite to fight against it. Rebels were grieving the Earth, demanding system change, and marching for the right to a just, sustainable future. Later, three brave rebels were arrested outside the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Manhattan after they climbed the Columbus Circle Globe and dropped a banner demanding Climate Justice. Rebels chanted ‘We are unstoppable. Another world is possible’ against a jazzy backdrop provided by street performers. Videos here. 1&2 SEP | The Hague & Amsterdam, The Netherlands A ‘burgerberaad’ (citizens’ assembly) is the latest fashion. Photo: Romy Fernandez Rebels in The Netherlands announced their upcoming September Rebellion with actions in The Hague and Amsterdam. As MPs returned to the Tweede Kamer (Dutch Parliament) after their summer recess, they were greeted by 400 climate protestors from a coalition of Extinction Rebellion Netherlands, Fridays for Future and Youth Climate Action. 50 rebels jumped into the pond surrounding the Parliament calling out the government’s inaction on the climate emergency and to kick the fossil fuel lobby out of the corridors of power. ‘Polderen tot het water aan de lippen staat?’ ‘Making political compromises and slow decisions until the water rises to our lips’ With a ‘trashion fashion’ show, where all items were made from discarded materials, rebels called for a citizens’ assembly on the climate and ecological emergency. Rebels will return to Parliament on budget day, 15 September, to shed a tear for what is likely to be another wasted year of climate inaction in their ‘Traanrede’, a tearful pun on the ‘Troonrede’ (a yearly speech by the King from his Throne announcing budget plans). The next day, rebels moved to Amsterdam for a royal announcement. Two rebels, imitating King Willem Alexander and Queen Maxima, climbed onto the balcony of the palace on Dam Square for a royal wave and to drop a banner sharing their support for the upcoming Rebellion. The September Rebellion will be back in action in The Hague on 15 September and for a long weekend of disruption from 18 to 21 September in Amsterdam, find out more here. 04 SEP | Lyon, France This week saw XR Lyon resume a long-running campaign against ‘trotinettes’. Rebels in the city claim these ‘free-floating’ electric scooters are clogging up public spaces at the expense of public transport, pedestrians, and ultimately the environment - not least by perpetuating the culture of cheap ‘throwaway’ goods at odds with a sustainable future (see their masterful summary here). ‘Your lithium batteries lead us to the funeral-home’ sounds a lot cooler in French, trust us The night’s action saw the ‘sabotage’ (generally achieved by spraying the QR code with an extinction symbol) of 100 trotinettes, along with the appearance of awareness-raising posters and posts. As French rebels return from les vacances and build up towards autumnal actions, we’re excited to see what might come next! 1 SEP - Ongoing | London, Cardiff, Manchester. Newspaper printer blockade. Credit: Gareth Morris The UK is about to chalk off its 8th day of Rebellion. But it’s fair to say that whatever lies ahead, for sheer impact, nothing will top the action we woke up to on Saturday. Overnight, 100 rebels had blockaded three major newspaper printers, causing a major shortage of newspapers across the country. The targeted titles were owned by 5 billionaires who dominate the UK’s media landscape, and suppress the truth about the climate crisis to suit their business interests. With the oligarchs unsettled, the mainstream media could no longer ignore us, and the government threatened to reclassify our movement as an ‘organised crime group’. Policing became at times comically overzealous, with no less than 14 police vans lying in wait to dismantle the Lightship Greta, a handmade boat on shopping trolley wheels that had been pushed all the way from Brighton to London by a dedicated rebel crew. The Lightship Greta. Over 100 police officers were waiting to impound it as it entered London. While stopping the printing presses was the most exciting action so far, the tabling of the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill in parliament was perhaps the most hopeful. The CEE Bill represents a new tactic in our fight for a stable planet: a piece of legislation written by scientists, lawyers, activists, and yes, rebels that could turn our demands into UK law. Yup, that’s a Rebellion. Credit: Chris Jerrey Other action highlights include the blockading of a polluting waste incinerator in Cardiff to highlight the city’s terrible air quality, a blue marine march, a disco-bedience featuring a polar bear inside Manchester’s local authority (owner of the biggest and oiliest public pension fund in the UK), and the brilliant speeches given by Rebel writers outside a house in Tufton Street - home to a nexus of climate denying lobbyists that have been whispering in our politicians’ ears for decades. To catch up on more UK action, see past issues of Rebel Daily - the rebellion-time daily newsletter. Nelson, New Zealand. Under the cover of darkness, rebels chained themselves to the gates of the Ravensdown chemical depot to stop the illegal importation of synthetic fertilisers and blood phosphate from the Western Sahara, where Indigeonous peoples are persecuted by the Moroccan government. Jakarta and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Rebels placed over 500 shoes donated from across Indonesia during their month of celebrating their independence as a country. The installation represents the people’s desire to be free from the climate crisis too. Istanbul, Turkey. With love from Turkey.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/08/31/act-now-extinction-rebellion-demands/,"Extinction Rebellion demands that governments act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero as soon as possible. Here’s why. Photo: Markus Spiske. The future is coming for us — faster than we imagined. Destruction that was forecast to unfold decades from now is already here. As carbon emissions and global temperatures continue to rise, extreme weather is becoming both more common and more destructive. The science is only becoming clearer as the years pass. An ever-growing number of scientific studies prove two things: the earth is warming and we are the cause. Changes that were predicted years ago — like severe storms, heat waves, and melting glaciers and ice sheets — are accelerating. Climate feedback loops — in which a symptom of climate change, such as more frequent wildfires, feeds the causes of climate change — are creating a cascade effect. And scientists are learning that the earth is even more sensitive to increases in carbon emissions than they initially thought. Some of the most above-average temperatures have been recorded in places we’d expect to be the coldest, including parts of Siberia, Alaska and Antarctica. And for over two decades, the Arctic has been warming much faster than the rest of the planet. Today, Arctic warming is happening at least two and a half times as fast as the global average. At the same time, we are going through a mass extinction event. The number of animals living on the earth has fallen by half since the 1970s. The extinction rate of species is now thought to be about 1,000 times higher than before humans dominated the planet. Through pollution, destruction of habitats such as forests and industrial agriculture, human activity is shrinking the space for all species to survive. As we disrupt and kill off species after species of the ecosystem, we are not only losing what cannot be replaced — we are disrupting the conditions that make human life itself possible. It is only by allowing nature the space and protection it needs to survive that the human species can avoid total ecological collapse and possibly our own extinction. Powerful interests who profit from the status quo have blocked meaningful progress. They have lobbied against environmental laws that would limit emissions. They’ve made it their goal to make people care less about the climate and ecological crisis. In 2020 alone, fossil fuel companies contributed around $50 million to politicians in the United States. But, like the polar ice caps on a 38C day, the comfort zone in which denial has been possible is quickly shrinking. We are living through an ever more undeniable climate crisis. Without urgent action, the coming decades will bring an increasingly inhospitable new normal. We remain on track for man-made temperature increases of more than two degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. This was the threshold outlined in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which world leaders vowed to stay “well below” because they deemed it too risky. A threshold that many scientists have since argued does not go far or fast enough. In fact, five years on, we’re not yet close to reining in global temperatures. Not even close to meeting the emissions reduction goals that countries set for themselves, which were already insufficient in their ambition. Top climate scientists, including Sir Robert Watson, the former chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have said that we’re on track for catastrophic warming of 3-⁠⁠4C by the end of the century. We can still create a better future. But only if we urgently demonstrate to our governments that we do not accept the status quo. A status quo of irreparable harm to our collective wellbeing and to that of future generations. A scenario in which those who can least afford it will suffer the most. The good news is that climate change’s clear and catastrophic consequences are at last making it a mainstream concern. The majority of people surveyed in a recent poll in 26 countries say climate change is a major threat to their nation, a drastic increase from 2013. Technology has also progressed significantly. If introduced now, low or zero-carbon technologies could help to reduce the emissions generated by our everyday activities. But, while these developments are positive, they are not yet enough. Concern without action is meaningless. When it comes to the accelerating climate and ecological crisis, conventional resistance — voting, petitions, lobbying — is failing to do the job. Photo: Callum Shaw. What does work is mass civil disobedience. Studies show that worldwide movements for change that actively engaged 3.5 percent of the population have been most successful in achieving their goals. It’s now time to convert mainstream concern into mass mobilisation. Through Extinction Rebellion’s non-violent civil disobedience, people like you are disrupting business as usual to demand deep decarbonisation. Every single person who protests is increasing our chances of creating a better future. Bold actions like occupying roads, blockading bridges and creatively disrupting the work of banks which finance the climate crisis can capture government and media attention and change the conversation in ways conventional resistance hasn’t. While some may call our approach extreme, it is no more than what is necessary — and far less disruptive than what is coming if we fail to act. Thanks to a growing community of rebels worldwide, the movement is gaining strength and shifting the conversation, but we need your help to reach critical mass. The window of opportunity is getting smaller but is still very real. Can you help us avoid climate and ecological catastrophe and create a better future? Act now.

Will the world stay silent? We care for the environment, we care for our existence.” Extinction Rebellion activists chained themselves together in the foyer of Australian energy company Santos to protest the company’s Narrabri gas development. The project, which has strong government backing, would involve up to 850 coal seam gas wells being drilled on 1,000 hectares of a site that includes the Pilliga forest, the largest remaining woodland wilderness in New South Wales (NSW). Santos says it could provide up to 200 terajoules of gas a day for 20 years, equivalent to 50% of NSW demand. Rebels take action outside the Sydney headquarters of CommBank, which has lent over Aus$12 billion to the fossil fuel industry after promising shareholders that they would adhere to the Paris Agreement. Extinction Rebellion, alongside human rights and environmental organisations, demonstrate outside the Chinese Embassy to protest about the hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels which appeared in late July off the Galapagos Islands, threatening their unique marine ecosystems. In a powerful display of non-violent civil disobedience, Israeli rebels and other activists blocked the access roads to Israel’s parliament, the Knesset. They were protesting against an anti-democratic law which will reduce parliament’s supervision of government actions. They were violently cleared by police and one rebel was arrested. Israeli rebels sprayed the entrance of the Harel Group, Israel’s third largest insurance company, with simulated oil. “In such a severe climate crisis,” they said, “it is insane to invest billions of shekels of our pension money in polluting fuels such as oil and gas!” Celebrating the birth of Extinction Rebellion Seoul! Czech rebels held a second ‘picnic’ at Prague Castle, including a performance of Discobedience, eating, singing, and a Buddhist meditation. They sent an open letter to the President of the Republic, asking for a meeting to discuss the climate crisis. The action continued into the night. Filipino XR rebels joined environmental advocates and climate justice activists in mass protests against President Duterte’s State of the Nation address and to denounce the regime’s anti-people, anti-ecology policies. They expressed their defiance by bringing together umbrellas to form the sky, the land, and the sea, with the call “WE RESIST AS ONE PLANET” Members of Extinction Rebellion participated in a joint demonstration of twenty-seven organisations who marched to the Ministry of Agriculture to highlight the state's lack of drought action. They demanded that government reform the management of fields, forests and cities, and make rapidly achieving zero carbon a national priority. Speakers included farmer representatives and citizens affected by mineral extraction and the construction of dams. XR rebels contributed to a protest by watermen under the iconic Charles Bridge and displayed five large hand-embroidered flags outlining possible ways to change our relationship with the natural world. Second day of the hunger strike in front of the headquarters of Poland’s government-owned national television network, Telewizja Polska (TVP). Four Extinction Rebellion activists are protesting against the broadcaster’s silence about the causes and effects of climate change. Extinction Rebellion and other activists held a demonstration and die-in in front of the Wroclaw Pillory to protest against the city’s passivity about the destruction of nature and the climate crisis. It is the longest river in Poland. It was and is of great importance in every corner of the country. As children, we sang songs about her and listened to her legends. The Vistula, queen of Polish rivers, is drying up due to climate change and disastrous corporate and human actions. On 10 August, in the light of the setting sun and by the symbolic statue of the Warsaw Mermaid, XR Warsaw and a broad range of animal, youth, and environmental activists witnessed the Vistula’s funeral. Wearing face masks with the XR logo, Orleans rebels stopped shoppers at the summer sales to draw attention to the overproduction and mass consumption that is destroying the living world. Activists from XR Strasbourg, the Ecofeminists Strasbourg collective, the ZAD mobile movement and concerned citizens joined together to fight against the establishment of a giant 190,000 square metre e-commerce warehouse at Ensisheim, between Strasbourg and Basle.

In Munich, Lübeck, Berlin and Düsseldorf activists protested against short-haul flights that contribute to Germany's large and unjust carbon footprint. One brave rebel boarded a plane at Berlin’s Tegel airport and spoke to passengers to stop it taking off. In a symbolic action, Bologna rebels laid out 88 black and 12 red t-shirts in the city’s Piazza Nettuno to represent the proportion of Italian deaths from air pollution (black) and Covid-19 (red). On the second anniversary of Fridays for Future, rebels blocked a main road in Finland’s capital to protest against the new Datteln 4 coal-fired power station in Germany. The plant is operated by Uniper, a subsidiary of the Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum. The action was in support of the climate youth who called an European-wide action day against Datteln 4. 19 brave rebels got detained and were given fines for disobeying the police. On its website, Fortum calls itself “a leading clean-energy company” and says a focus on reducing CO2 emissions “has been in Fortum’s DNA for decades.” Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) estimate Datteln 4 will emit 8.4 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. On 17 August, three determined Finnish rebels entered their eighth day of hunger strike to demand more rapid action on climate change. Their colourful camp is located between the parliament and Central Library. One of the hunger strikers said: “We have one demand to the government, which is to commit to cutting carbon emissions by 20% by the end of 2021, and then by a further 20% every year so that Finland is carbon neutral, or net neutral, by the end of 2025.” Photo: News Now Finland. One year after Cornish rebels performed their moving beach action, The Sea Is Rising and So Are We, a single red rebel retraced their steps. His anniversary action was as witness and a lament - a lament for lost lands, lost peoples, lost ocean life, lost Arctic ice and lost coral reefs.

Support the Rebellion 26 JUL | Istanbul, Turkey Rebels from XR Turkey joined hundreds of protestors in Istanbul to condemn theviolent arrest of environmental activists trying to reach Mount Idato protect it from mining. The mountain has been devastated by a Canadian gold mine which has raised hundreds of thousands of trees and used cyanide to extract the gold. A coach-load of activists from Istanbul were blocked by police and then arrested, while activists in nearby Çanakkale had their press conference stormed by police for apparently breaching Covid-19 guidelines.Over 20 activists were fined and jailed overnight. Police storm an Ekoloji Birliği (Union of Ecology) press conference in Çanakkale Photo: SÖZCÜ Last year the mine was the site of huge protests. A small group of those protestors have stayed on the mountain ever since, using drones to check the gold mine doesn’t restart operations. Authorities have fined them for their ‘illegal accommodation’ to the tune of thousands of dollars - but the protestors remain. The arrested activists had intended to join them to mark the 1st anniversary of those original protests. A recent report by TEMA, a Turkish environmental group, uncovered that 79% of Mount Ida has been licensed for mining by the government. XR Turkey and members of Mount Ida solidarity groups have vowed to not let repression and detentions stop them from defending the mountain. 21 JUL | Jerusalem, Israel In Israel a group of brave rebelsblocked one of 3 roads leading to the parliament,the Knesset, while the other 2 roads were simultaneously blocked by other movements. In a remarkable display of non-violent civil disobedience, they physically blocked access to the Knesset to prevent an anti-democratic law from passing, which would reduce parliament’s power to supervise the government’s actions, using the Coronaviruspandemicas a cover. All roads were aggressively cleared by the police. One rebel was arrested. Check out our Unchained from XR Israel recently. 8 AUG| Taichung, Taiwan On Saturday 8 August, XR Taiwan rebels joined other environmental groups on the streets of Taichung City in central Taiwan, to call on the government to cut air pollution and coal use. The city is home to Taiwan’s largest coal-fired power plant. Photo: Su Chin-feng, Taipei Times The protestors gathered in front of the city government’s municipal building before setting off on a march. The parade was led by Yeh Guang-perng, chairman of Air Clean Taiwan, and Mayor Lin Shih-hsien, who dressed as trees to highlight the climate and ecological emergency. The Mayordeclared aclimate emergency for the first time in Taiwan.“This year is the most crucial time for people to choose a future of sustainability or extinction,” he told The Taipei Times. The protestors urged the government to do the same, to promote green policies and shift to a net-zero carbon economy . 9 AUG | London, UK, and Worldwide The steps of Trafalgar Squareturned red with fake blood, and the fountain neon green, as rebels declared an Indigenous Emergency in London. Banners displayed the motto ‘Genocide = Ecocide’, and people painted one hand red, one green, to highlight the plight of Indigenous Tribes in Brazil. Actions also took place in Spain, Portugal, and the US. Five rebels were arrested. 706 indigenous people says “We denounce [the federal indigenous health service’s] lack of transparency and institutional racism anddemand respect for our rights.” Indigenous tribes’ first contact with foreign infectious diseases (including influenza) was during the European colonial invasion in the 15th century, which wiped out92% of the indigenous population.

They were calling on the Finnishgovernment to stepup stop delaying action on climate change. In true XR style, the Kansalaistori camp - just outside the parliament -was a cheerful place full of colour, music and conversion.With many supportive passersby stopping to talk and learn about the CEE. Despite the laudable claims ofFinland's centre-left government, the unfortunate truth is that over the past year there has beennothing but procrastination on the climate crisis.Finland continues to subsidise burning peat and domestic flights, and the state owned power company, Fortum, just opened a new coal power station in Germany. Rebels said: ‘We have been inspired by the many people who have voiced their support, both privately and publicly. Over the past couple of weeks, we have also had a chance to talk with many politicians, including the minister for the environment and climate.’ ‘We are ending the hunger strike on our own terms, at a moment of our own choice. This is not a luxury that many people across the world enjoy. Realistic action will require uncomfortable changes to our lives, but if the alternative is catastrophic climate change,the choice should be clear.Our struggle continues.’ Who would have thought that we’d have too many actions for one newsletter? You amaze us, rebels. Keep it up!

They love it so much that they investover abillion and a half shekels in it. “Psagot Investment House... is behaving selfishly and gluttonously devouring the rest of the carbon budget that we all have left. This return is going to cost us blood.” 15 JUL | Boston, USA Rebels staged a die-inoutsidethe Federal Reserve building in Boston to demand our government end fossil fuel bailouts and invest in renewables!

The XR Africa News team are doing wonderful work. The Troublemaker for the link. The film follows the personal awakenings of two people as they accept the reality of climate and ecological breakdown and decide to do something about it. The first is Roger Hallam, praised and vilified by many both inside and outside of Extinction Rebellion. From organic farmer to social science theorist and one-time co-founder of XR, Hallam recently stepped away from any formal role in XR to form his own political party. The other protagonist is Sylvia Dell, retired mother of 4 from South Devon, UK. Through Sylvia, we get a glimpse of how ecological activism can play out in the life of an apparently ‘ordinary’, law-abiding citizen. Want to supportXR groups around the world?

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/08/20/reduce-your-carbon-footprint/,"While climate change is a complex problem in need of a unified global response, every individual effort towards building a safer future is valuable. By making changes to our individual lifestyles based on environmental concern, we can help to influence the attitudes and behaviours of those around us in relation to addressing the climate crisis. We can lead by example and assist in sending a message to those in positions of power that we will not stand for ‘business as usual.’ If you’re hesitant to take direct action in the form of joining a climate change protest or organisation, you can help to make a difference by trying to reduce your own carbon footprint. You’ve probably noticed that the term “carbon footprint” is used a lot when discussing climate change. But what exactly does it mean? A carbon footprint is a way to measure greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases such as carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat in the atmosphere and thereby contribute greatly to global warming. A carbon footprint is determined by the sum of these greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere either directly or indirectly by our actions (usually in tons per year). This can be applied to individuals, families, companies, events, products and even countries. Your carbon footprint is measured by your lifestyle and regular activities that result in greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the most common examples of these lifestyle factors and activities include: So how can you measure yours? The process of working out your own carbon footprint has never been easier. You can simply access any of the free carbon footprint calculators available online. One of the simplest and quickest can be found at www.conversation.org. The higher your carbon footprint, the greater your contribution will be towards global warming and subsequently climate change. While direct action must be taken against the biggest global carbon emitters, we would also do well to consider our own contributions. By taking individual action to lower our own carbon emissions, we can help to reduce overall consumer demand in these industries. Many individuals making small changes to their daily lives can send a powerful message that we do not stand for ‘business as usual’ and demand a change in current practices. We are currently in a critical stage of human history where we have the opportunity to change the fate of our planet and secure a better world for future generations to come. One of the most immediate actions you can take to limit climate change is to reduce your own greenhouse gas emissions by lowering your carbon footprint. Here are 10 simple ways that you can reduce your carbon footprint: Source: Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay Did you know that the way you choose to spend, save and invest your money can make a huge difference when it comes to reducing your carbon footprint? It’s no secret that some of the world’s largest banks love to use your hard-earned money to fund the fossil fuel industry. In fact, since the 2015 Paris Agreement the world’s 60 biggest banks have spent $3.8 trillion on fossil fuels! If you don’t fancy your money being used for environmental destruction and want to greatly reduce your individual carbon footprint, it’s time to make a change. How can I do this? Go Green. So who can you trust with your money? Luckily, bank.green has made the process of choosing a sustainable bank super easy. You can compare the ethical banks available in your country and make the move today. Eating more plant foods can help to reduce your carbon footprint. Photo by Anna Pelzer on Unsplash One of the greatest ways to reduce your carbon footprint begins with what you put on your plate every day. This is because the meat and dairy industries are some of the top contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, some researchers have even suggested that these industries may be the leading cause of climate change. So why are farm animals so toxic to the environment? Raising livestock for food produces large amounts of methane - a gas that traps much more heat than carbon dioxide. This makes it particularly dangerous when it comes to global warming. In addition to its impact on the climate, animal agriculture is also the leading cause of deforestation. As demand for animal products continues to increase, more land is cleared for livestock. This contributes greatly to global warming as cutting down trees not only releases stored carbon dioxide into the air but also reduces the Earth’s ability to naturally absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. While eating a plant-based diet may reduce your contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 73 percent, it’s important to note that the industrial production of fertilizer to produce plant foods is also problematic when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. This is where regenerative agriculture (a holistic farming approach that focuses on soil health) could be a key solution. In the meantime, getting more fruits and vegetables into your daily diet is a great way to both reduce your carbon footprint from current farming methods and improve your health. How can I do this? Riding your bike to work can reduce your environmental impact. Photo by Snapwire on pexels.com. An average car produces approximately 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. It does this by burning fossil fuels such as petrol, which then produces carbon dioxide from the exhaust pipe. As of 2018, road transport was responsible for at least 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to one study. If you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint, considering alternative modes of transport that don’t rely on the burning of fossil fuels will help you to do so. How can I do this? Solar power is a form of low-carbon energy. Photo by Sungrow EMEA on Unsplash. Another great way to reduce your carbon footprint is to switch your electricity provider to a company that uses low-carbon energy. For example, renewable (or clean) energy comes from natural sources such as sunlight, wind or water. This has a much lower carbon footprint than energy that relies on the burning of fossil fuels. Electricity and heat contributed as much as 15 billion tons (or 13.6 metric tons) of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide in 2016. That number continues to rise as changes in the climate lead to increased reliance on heating systems and air conditioning. In order to avoid the catastrophic consequences of failing to take action against climate change, it is critical that we begin to reduce our reliance on the fossil fuel industry and move to low-carbon energy providers instead. How can I do this? Reduce, reuse, and recycle items in order to produce less waste. Photo by ready made from Pexels. Did you know that globally we dump over 2.12 billion tons of waste per year? According to Our World In Data, at least 6 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food loss and waste. While this might not seem like a large percentage, it is actually three times the amount of emissions that come from international flights. So if you’re wondering how to reduce your carbon footprint, cutting down on your waste is a great way to do it. How can I do this? Rethink your fashion choices to reduce your carbon footprint. Photo by Zui Hoang on Unsplash. The way that clothing is currently designed, manufactured, and used results in enormous waste and pollution. The “fast fashion” industry alone is responsible for around 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.N. You can reduce your carbon footprint, waste and pollution simply by rethinking the way that you buy clothes. By reducing the amount of clothing that you buy, only buying second-hand, or purchasing from eco-friendly companies, you can help to reduce your impact on the environment. How can I do this? LED light bulbs are much more energy efficient. Image by Daniel Reche from Pixabay. While choosing a renewable energy provider is the first thing you should consider when trying to reduce your carbon footprint at home, using energy efficient appliances can cut your greenhouse gas contributions even further. Energy efficient appliances are designed to use less energy than standard appliances. They are generally more environmentally friendly and can save you money over time. How can I do this? Try taking the train to your next travel destination. Photo by veerasak Piyawatanakul from Pexels. If you’re serious about reducing your carbon footprint, you should rethink the way that you travel. Planes are one of the most polluting modes of transport, along with cars. This is because aircraft require a lot of petrol to run efficiently. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation industry was predicted to triple its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. If it continues with business as usual following the pandemic, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint could continue to grow exponentially if not restricted. By choosing to travel less or more sustainably, you can reduce your carbon footprint. How can I do this? Use a ceiling fan where possible to reduce your energy consumption. Image by 관성 정 from Pixabay. As the climate continues to change, global reliance on air conditioning systems is expected to triple by 2050. This is worrisome for global warming, as heaters and air conditioners require a lot of electricity to run effectively, which is sourced from fossil fuels. Manufactured cooling systems also release a greenhouse gas known as Hydrofluorocarbon (HCF) into the atmosphere, which has a much greater heat-trapping capacity than carbon dioxide. By reevaluating the way that you use these systems at home, you can not only reduce your carbon footprint but also save some money on your energy bill. How can I do this? Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash. If you’ve made it this far, you’re likely to be serious about reducing your carbon footprint and making a positive change for the future of our planet. Climate change is an issue that requires urgent action and systemic changes to the way that society currently functions. Time is running out and we are rapidly hurtling towards an unsafe future for all of mankind. While individual actions are an important part of the battle against climate change, meaningful progress will come from using our collective power. By joining the global rebellion against the current destructive ‘business as usual’ attitude of governments and corporations, you can help to advocate for a safer future for us all. Though this may not directly reduce your own carbon footprint, it has the potential to make the largest difference in the shortest amount of time towards preventing further global warming. So if you’re passionate about making a difference by reducing your own carbon footprint, why not expand your goals to include advocating for the reduction of the global carbon footprint as well? How can I do this? The best thing you can do is to act now and join Extinction Rebellion. We are a global environmental movement of concerned citizens who use non-violent civil disobedience to compel governments to act to address the climate and ecological crisis.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/07/30/lockdown-emissions/,"Article by Shireen Tawil The first few months of 2020 shook up our lives in a way few of us have ever experienced. Beginning in China and moving outwards rapidly, lockdowns swept the world in a domino effect. People were told to stay home, non-essential businesses were closed, the roaring engines of manufacturing and industry fell silent, and the streets of cities that never sleep suddenly echoed with emptiness. Clear sky and water. Venice, Italy. June, 2020. Photo by Janou Baton. People across the world experienced tremendous grief as hundreds of thousands lost their lives to COVID-19, and we were forced to accept a ‘new normal’. The deep pain felt by so many of us at the loss of life cannot be overstated, and carries a weight that cannot, and should not, be brushed aside. Without discounting the emotional toll at its source, this abrupt disruption of the world’s daily rhythms has raised many truths - previously hidden beneath the hustle and bustle of busy life - up to the surface. This disruption has shattered illusions, exposing outrageous inequalities around the world, revealing the brutality our current socio-economic structures inflict upon so many lives. Among these shattered perceptions is the idea that our air pollution is not quite so bad. With factories stopped, cars parked, and airplanes grounded, the skies opened up for us and the waters cleared. The drop in emissions has thus brought the issue of air pollution to the attention of many in a more tangible way. My terrace in Milan has always confronted me with the dirty air we breathe here. The pollution is so high that if I don’t scrub the terrace clean weekly, my children come inside with their hands and feet covered in black soot. My five-year-old is asthmatic and has been hospitalized twice for pneumonia - the first time coming just a week shy of his first birthday. During the 70+ days of lockdown we experienced, I cleaned my terrace once, around day 10, and it is only now (90 days later) that I need to give it another clean. The difference in the terrace’s sootiness between the two periods is startling, and illustrates the impact the drop in emissions must have had. Exhaust from generators. Beirut, Lebanon. January, 2020. Photo by author. The three biggest contributors to air pollution are particulate matter (PM), ozone, and household pollutants. Their high presence in the air we breathe is dangerous to the health of both humans and the planet. PM is a combination of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Dust, dirt, soot and smoke are examples of visible forms of PM, while other particles are so small they can only be seen with a microscope. PM pollution is made up of two categories: PM10 (PM with a diameter of 10 micrometers) and PM2.5 (PM with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers). To put their size in perspective, a human hair has a diameter of 70 micrometers, meaning it is seven times larger than a PM10 and nearly 30 times larger than a PM2.5. Some particulates are directly emitted, for example from construction sites or the paving of roads. Others form in the atmosphere through a reaction between chemicals emitted by power plants, factories, and vehicles. https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm, https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data/estimate-burden There are two kinds of ozone - stratospheric ozone (the good kind, found in the atmosphere, which occurs naturally and protects us from the sun’s ultraviolet rays) and ground ozone (the bad kind, a man-made pollutant created by a combination of emissions and sunlight - also known as smog - that increases our risk of respiratory illnesses). A key ingredient in this pollutant is nitrogen dioxide, or NO2. https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics These can be any number of pollutants: cigarette smoke, fuel for cooking, cleaning sprays, mosquito repellents, or artificial fragrances. They are common and vary around the world. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5089137/, https://www.stateofglobalair.org/health These three air pollutants contaminate the air we breathe, turning this vital, life-sustaining resource into one that may also compromise our health. They each harm our health differently, increasing the risk of certain health problems. We take an average of 25,000 breaths a day, giving us that many chances of breathing PM10, or smaller particles, deep into our lungs. They may even enter our bloodstream. Short-term exposure to ground ozone can increase asthma complications, and long-term exposure can even increase the risk of death due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Household pollutants have also been shown to affect our health in the womb, before we are even born. And early childhood exposures “tend to have repercussions throughout life.” Spray cleaners are a common household pollutant. Photo by Crystal de Passilleé-Chabot, unsplash.com. Beyond the slew of respiratory illnesses caused by pollutants in the air, there is also an increased occurrence of death, ‘with total air pollution (PM2.5, ozone, and household pollution) contribut[ing] to almost five million deaths globally - nearly 1 in 10 deaths - in 2017.’ With 90% of the world’s population breathing dangerously polluted air, it is evident that the pollutants we are pumping into the air are threatening our lives. These levels of air pollution disproportionately affect the Global South, low-income communities, and communities of color - illustrating the link between poverty and health, and the need for climate justice. Data Source: https://www.stateofglobalhealth.org/health But during the months that countries went into lockdown, something extraordinary happened: our air became cleaner - by a lot. Factories stopped churning out pollutants and road and air traffic basically came to a standstill. In major cities around the world, air pollution plummeted as lockdowns went on. In some cases, it fell far below the last four years’ national average for that same period of time. In Delhi, PM2.5 rates decreased by 60%, and Los Angeles had its longest period of ‘clean air’ as defined by WHO guidelines. Satellite images have captured the visible difference in air pollution over the first quarter of 2020 in various cities across the world, and the change is striking. In Europe, PM10 dropped dramatically, by an average of 10%, during the 30-day period from March 27 to April 25, and NO2 decreased by approximately 40% from its average levels. We have seen huge shifts in energy use too, which have contributed to the fall in pollutants. During the first quarter of 2020, non-renewable energy fell dramatically, as demand decreased, and the use of renewable energy increased. Around the world, countries shifted away from fossil fuels: Austria and Sweden closed their last coal power plants; Portugal was coal-free for at least 2 months; the UK did it for at least 35 days; and the Netherlands reduced its coal plants by 75% to comply with a court order to reduce the risks associated with the climate emergency. In a huge boost for renewable energy, India, the world's second-biggest coal consumer, is ditching coal and prioritizing low-cost solar energy for its electricity needs. The change in energy use was so significant that the oil and gas industry crashed, with experts saying it is unlikely to return to its former standing. Data Source: https://energyandcleanair.org/air-pollution-deaths-avoided-in-europe-as-coal-oil-plummet/ So, if high levels of pollution are so bad for our health, what happens when air pollution decreases as it just has, even for a short time? As it turns out, a lot of illness is avoided and many lives are saved. One study looked at the avoided deaths and positive health outcomes in Europe that came with this drop in air pollution. It found that the decreased air pollution resulted in avoiding a projected 11,000 early deaths in Europe, where nearly 500,000 deaths were attributable to air pollution in 2016 Data Source: https://energyandcleanair.org/air-pollution-deaths-avoided-in-europe-as-coal-oil-plummet/ It also found that several key negative health impacts were avoided, projecting 1.3 million fewer days of work missed due to illness, 6,000 fewer new cases of asthma in children and nearly 2,000 avoided trips to emergency rooms due to asthma attacks. Finally, the reduction in air pollution would mean 575 fewer preterm births. Source: https://energyandcleanair.org/air-pollution-deaths-avoided-in-europe-as-coal-oil-plummet/ These findings are crucial for understanding how our health can be improved by a reduction in air pollution. If we act on this knowledge, asthma-related hospital visits may decrease; hundreds more pregnancies could be carried to full-term, avoiding many potential lifelong health problems; and children could live healthier lives. This case study focuses on the experience of Europe with lower air pollution, and the projected positive health outcomes. However, based on its findings, we may hypothesize that similar health improvements would happen globally with lowered air pollution. Indeed, one study on China’s reduction in air pollution found that just two months of cleaner air saved the lives of up to 4,000 children and 73,000 adults. The WHO estimates that air pollution shortens our lives by a global average of 1 year and 8 months, and that “If global air quality met WHO’s Air Quality guideline for PM2.5 (10 µg/m3), people today would live an average of about 7 months longer.” The link is clear—cleaner air means longer, healthier lives for us all. In addition to physical health benefits, the fall in emissions has led to a renewal in our connection with nature, boosting our mental health. On a visual level, people around the world have marveled at what clear skies look like, a memory that many had lost in recent decades. In India, people have been awed by the view of the Himalayas for the first time in their lives - a natural wonder usually lost behind clouds of smog. In personal conversations, my own family members have delighted in the blue skies over Beirut and in, once again, being able to see Lebanese mountain ranges that are normally shrouded in smog. Himalayas, Nepal. Photo by Bisesh Gurung, unsplash.com. Connecting with nature - whether in real life, online, or through art, by experiencing the weather, looking at a potted plant on your windowsill, a hike through the woods, and everything in between, increases mental wellbeing and one’s relationship to the world around us. These experiences are linked to many positive effects, including happiness, imagination, creativity, school performance, improved sleep and stress reduction. Reduced emissions have literally helped us see the world around us once again, reconnecting us with our natural surroundings and boosting our mental health. The decrease in air pollution during the months of global lockdown has given us a unique glimpse of what a world with cleaner air could mean: increased life expectancy, improved quality of life, fewer early deaths, less burdened healthcare systems, and greater wellbeing. While the results of these studies are hopeful, they were borne out of a global disaster that brought grief and pain to many across the world. But, while we cannot draw happiness from the context in which these findings emerged, it is up to us to learn our lessons well and apply them to creating a healthier world. As we look ahead to our eventual pandemic-free future, we must ask ourselves: what steps can we take to deliberately pursue these health outcomes within the context of a thriving, better-functioning society? It is incumbent upon us to do all we can to lower emissions. The drop in emissions we experienced during the first quarter of 2020 has been considerable, but it is not enough. To holistically care for our health as humans and that of the planet, we need an annual 7.6 percent drop in emissions, and they are only projected to fall 5% in 2020. Meeting our goals requires a creative, positive rethinking of our relationships on a global, national, and individual level, and of the roles we each play in contributing to harmful emissions. We must redouble our demands for clean energy and lower carbon emissions. Since lockdowns have eased, around the world emissions have already begun rising again, in some cases exceeding pre-lockdown levels. In the context of the global response to the current pandemic, we have seen that willing governments are capable of acting quickly to face a threat head-on and implementing preventative measures to protect their populations. The capacity is there - it is the will that must be reinforced through sustained calls for action by the people. Global Climate Strike, London, UK. photo by Corie Kull, unsplash.com One way to make sure governments prioritize people over profit is through the creation of citizens’ assemblies. A citizen’s assembly is a people-led, transparent, democratic body to pressure governments to follow through on the people’s demands for meaningful action to protect us from environmental breakdown. They have proven an effective means of communicating between the people and the government when the two are faced with a political standstill, and are gaining growing support. Citizens’ assemblies’ potential effectiveness has led to their being adopted as XR’s third global demand. Emissions control is, moreover, already a key component of both France’s citizens’ assembly on climate and the UK’s recently convened citizens’ assembly. Governments are accountable to their people, and must be held to this. While maintaining the pressure on governments to protect our health and the environment, we can make changes to our own lifestyle and move towards a healthier way of life. Many of us have rediscovered the beauty of walking or biking as a way of getting around. From Kampala to Paris, a number of governments have recently encouraged this zero-emissions mode of transport with plans to create more pedestrian walkways and bike lanes. The more we use these services, the fewer emissions we create personally and the more we encourage governments to invest in this more sustainable kind of city planning. With public concern over the environmental emergency growing rapidly, some governments have slowly introduced laws and regulations to control our environmental impact. Alarmingly, however, others have removed swaths of environmental regulations and rules in a bid to please big business. Money clearly talks, and we can use ours to pressure organizations and businesses to divest from fossil fuels and other polluting industries. After effective petitioning, The Royal Shakespeare Company decided to end its sponsorship by BP and, similarly, The National Theatre has agreed to end its Shell membership this year in an effort to go carbon neutral. Successes build on each other, and with the threat of losing money, businesses may suddenly begin to listen and take action. It is our right to demand cleaner air and better health outcomes for ourselves and future generations. Such a future is within our reach, and it is within our means to achieve it. Many are now rejecting what was previously considered acceptable and don’t want to return to ‘normal’. We have seen what is possible and must hold governments, industries, and companies accountable for their roles in causing and enabling air pollution and the resulting harm to our health. We must also make changes to our own lifestyles. We can live healthier lives. We can live longer lives. We can take our loved ones to hospital less often. We can give our children clean air. This is all possible. This is the moment to make those changes - to demand those changes - to make clean air ‘the new normal’. The findings on emissions’ effects on our health have emerged from a global tragedy - one we do not wish to ever experience again. Let’s take these hard-learned lessons and forge a healthier future for us all.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/07/22/pandemics-environment/,"Pandemics, ecology, and climate are hopelessly intertwined. The climate and ecological crisis sickens and displaces both wild animals and human beings. It creates excellent conditions for pests like ticks and mosquitoes to breed as well as for deadly bacteria to multiply. And it literally thaws ancient pathogens from the ground. All of these lead to disease, which, when left unchecked, can result in pandemics. ﻿ This post explains some of the less-visible connections between infectious disease and the climate and ecological crisis; how many pandemics begin; and how, by fighting against environmental destruction, we can also play a part in preventing the next pandemic. What are some similarities between COVID-19, SARS, MERS, Ebola, swine flu (H1N1), Lyme disease, West Nile fever, and HIV/AIDS? All of these originated in wildlife before jumping to humans. The ancestors of HIV/AIDS and Ebola were first identified in chimpanzees, while West Nile fever and swine flu were first found in birds. (Also known as H1N1, swine flu originated in birds, jumped to pigs, and finally got to humans.) The remaining diseases originated in bats. In the case of COVID-19, there is strong evidence that an infected bat (1) came in close contact with other wild animals (very likely caged and stressed pangolins and civet cats) that were then exposed to, and possibly eaten by, a human who became infected.(2)(3) Airplanes and cruise ships then spread the disease worldwide, and the rest is history. In healthy natural environments, wild animals’ diseases circulate mostly in the wild and keep away from humans, with plant and animal diversity shielding humans from infection.(4)(5) This is largely because the vast majority of wild animals (including the previously-mentioned civet cats, pangolins, and most birds and bats) are afraid of humans and do their best to avoid us. Furthermore, with a multitude of wild animals available to infect, bacteria and viruses have little incentive to adapt themselves to human hosts. But when people destroy nature – cutting down forests to make farm land, criss-crossing wilderness with roads and pipelines, disruptively damming and diverting rivers that wild animals depend on – it kills those animals. It fragments animal communities, and causes the survivors to be hungry and stressed – becoming perfect incubators for disease. This also encourages those same animals to venture closer to humans to search for food. Scientists believe that this is why shrinking wilderness and disease outbreaks go hand in hand.(6)(7)(8) Destroying nature sickens wild animals, then brings their contagious diseases to us. Animal-borne diseases like Lyme disease, malaria, West Nile fever, and dengue are already moving into new regions. This is because longer, hotter summers, warmer winters, and increased annual rainfall cause the ticks, mosquitos, and fleas that carry these diseases to shift habitats, moving into areas that were previously inhospitable to them. (9)(10) By way of example, Europe has seen a sharp and shocking spike in West Nile virus infections, after years of record-breaking warmth,(11)(9) while in North America, warmer winters have dramatically expanded ticks’ ranges and made Lyme disease into a household name.(12)(13)(14) Like animal-borne diseases, diarrheal diseases like Salmonella and campylobacteriosis too benefit from higher temperatures and extreme weather. This is because warmer temperatures allow bacteria to multiply faster, while extreme weather creates flooding, sewage spillover, and standing pools of water, which all provide prime bacterial breeding grounds. (15)(16)(17) As the earth warms, warmer winters no longer kill disease-carrying pests. Warmer and longer summers, flooding, and extreme precipitation provide pests and bacteria more time and better conditions for reproduction. And all of these contribute to the spread of disease. Many people know that air pollution worsens asthma and heart disease(18)(19), but did you know that it also corresponded with deaths from infectious diseases? For COVID-19 sufferers, a small increase in a patient's exposure to air pollution was associated with an 8% higher death rate. This was true even when controlling for patient age, health, and wealth, the availability of healthcare services, the population density where they lived, and patients who used to live in polluted areas but didn’t anymore. Air pollution was also correlated with higher rates of death in the context of SARS(20) and pneumonia(21). Air pollution – even when we were only exposed to it as children – gives us a lifetime of higher susceptibility to many diseases. And people who are susceptible to disease are more likely to spread it. Air pollution has already contributed to the deadliness of the COVID-19 pandemic - it may well worsen the next one. During a summer heatwave in August 2016, anthrax thawed out of land that we had thought was permanently frozen – the permafrost. The escaped anthrax killed a 12-year-old boy, infected at least 20 other people, and killed more than 2,300 reindeer in the area. It was the region's first outbreak in 75 years.(22) This took place in a remote part of Siberia.(22) If it had happened in a city (or even an arctic village), the results might have been much worse. The climate crisis is causing the permafrost to thaw. Fast.(23). And many people expect pathogens trapped within the previously frozen ground – responsible for such diseases as polio, anthrax, smallpox and the Spanish flu – to eventually be released.(24) Human prehistory is long. We have no records, strategies, vaccines, or even names for the diseases that plagued our ancient ancestors. There's no reason to believe that those ancient diseases would be any less infectious or deadly than those we are fighting today. Fighting the climate and ecological crisis means fighting against the destruction of nature. It means fighting against extreme weather, and it means fighting against pollution. It means keeping it in the ground - both fossil fuels, and the frozen pathogens that their burning would release. It's too late to stop the COVID-19 pandemic from happening, but by fighting for the environment, you can be part of the fight against the arrival of the next pandemic. Extinction Rebellion calls this fight a rebellion. If you are interested, join us to tell the truth about pandemics, pollution, climate, ecological destruction, and how and why this toxic system will produce more pandemics. Take a small action: The next time you talk about pandemics, bring environmental issues into the discussion, too. They're more relevant than people may realize.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/07/16/xr-unchained-16/,"XR Ibiza 28 JUNE | Quito, Ecuador Extinction Rebellion Ecuador carried out a symbolic, peaceful action in front of the headquarters of the state oil company, Petroecuador. They were drawing attention to the lack of response by government and oil companies to the desperate situation of communities affected by the April 7 oil spill in the northern Amazon. Some 15,000 barrels of crude oil poured into two of the country’s most important rivers, affecting over 2,000 indigenous families and leaving 120,000 people without access to the rivers’ fresh water. XR Ecuador stands in solidarity with the indigenous peoples, who filed a lawsuit against the Ecuadorian government and private and state oil companies on April 29, 2020. Photo: Ivan Castaneira. 7 JULY | Paris, France Colombian activists and members of the Colombian diaspora of Paris, supported by Extinction Rebellion Paris, demonstrated in front of the Colombian consulate to denounce the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and intimidation against indigenous peoples by the Colombian armed forces. On June 21, 2020, a 13-year-old child, a member of the Embera Katio ancestral people, was raped by seven members of the Colombian army. A few days later, newspapers reported that last September a young Kille of the Nukak ethnic group, then aged 12, was kidnapped and raped for six days by the same army. At present, 118 members of the military are being investigated for acts of sexual violence. The indigenous peoples Embera Katio and Nukak Maku are among 38 indigenous peoples declared by the Colombian Constitutional Court to be in imminent risk of extinction as a result of colonisation, which has changed in form but not in substance. The militarisation of indigenous territories by armed groups that covet natural resources and control of territories not only endangers the existence of these peoples, but also the havens of biodiversity that they protect by their presence. 30 JUNE | Khartoum, Sudan Rebels from Extinction Rebellion Sudan demonstrate in Khartoum. 9 JULY | Canterbury, New Zealand The giant global dairy corporation Fonterra was greeted with drums, cow costumes, placards and a pile of coal, as Extinction Rebellion Ōtautahi (Christchurch) asked the question, Why are Fonterra still using coal in a climate emergency? Fonterra is responsible for approximately 30% of the world's dairy exports. A cooperative owned by 10,500 New Zealand farmers, it is New Zealand’s largest company. The demonstration follows Bathurst Resources’ application to expand the Canterbury coal mine, with most of its coal going to Fonterra’s nearby factory to dehydrate milk. An XR Ōtautahi spokesperson said: “The proposed expansion of the Canterbury coal mine has everything to do with Fonterra’s addiction to coal. They are burning coal to dry out milk. Why are we seeing these irresponsible decisions in the middle of a climate crisis?” Groups of rebels from all over Europe mobilised from June 29 to July 3 to denounce the aberrations of a system which destroys the conditions of our lives a little more every day. This first Europe-wide campaign enabled many countries to unite their voices to express the same message: instead of industries, it’s the planet that needs a recovery plan. 4 JULY | Tours, France Rebels protested against the millions of euros in bailouts granted by the French government to low-cost airlines. The woman’s placard compared the 30-euro price of a 1015-kilometre flight from Tours airport to Porto in Portugal with the same price for a train ticket from Tours to Paris (240km). 30 JUNE | Paris, France French rebels stripped to their underwear and poured ‘blood’ outside the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. Their goal: to ‘point the finger’ at political leaders injecting billions into a deadly ‘revival’ of the old normality instead of investing in the climate, biodiversity and other vital needs such as health, food security and employment. Seven rebels were arrested. 2 JULY | Helsinki, Finland Finnish rebels lay down in the street to block the cars of government ministers from entering the Senate building. They were demanding that politicians recognise that the economy can no longer be run as it was before the Covid-19 crisis. 2 JUL | Berlin, Germany Berlin rebels entered Germany’s parliament to protest a disastrous new law that would allow coal to be burned until 2039 - far too long if the country is to meet its Paris Agreement commitments. Rebels let it rain with leaflets and told the startled MPs that a citizens’ assembly was needed to take the necessary steps to tackle the climate crisis. The politicians ratified the new law anyway. As well as setting a phase-out deadline a decade too late, the law pledges €4.35 billion in compensation for the coal industry. Germany holds the EU presidency and is the 4th largest CO2 emitter in the world - its cosy attitude to coal sets a terrible example. Space age rebels protest the coal law after it was passed by parliament. 3 JULY | Munich, Germany Rebels wound 4 km of green thread between two columns at the entrance to the Munich offices of the European Commission to draw attention to the fact that the supposed European Green Deal is not very green at all and current EU climate policy is leading to disaster. 4 JULY | Budapest, Hungary ‘A Lifebelt for the Planet.’ Photo: Czele Annamária. As part of the Europe-wide actions, Hungarian rebels demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Finance. “Our governments provide unconditional support to save polluting industries such as the automotive industry or aviation. We demand that the Hungarian government focus on providing human needs such as health, food supply and the environment,” they said. 29 JUNE | Turin, Italy ’Intesa is naked’ read the signs, referring to the Italian bank Intesa SanPaolo. Turin rebels expressed their opposition outside its offices to the restart of the economy at the expense of planetary ecosystems and human lives. 5 JULY | Palermo, Sicily ‘No Rainbow on a Planet With No Rain’. More actions took place around Europe before and after the week-long Bail Out The Planet mobilisation. 7 JULY | Baltic pipeline, Denmark Fifteen rebels were arrested when they blocked a construction site for the new Baltic Pipe. Due for completion in October 2022, the pipeline will carry natural gas from the Norwegian sector of the North Sea to Poland via Denmark. The project is being developed by Danish operator Energinet and Poland’s Gaz-System. It received 215m euros of EU funding in 2019. 18 JUNE | State Forestry Management Centre, Estonia About 100 rebels and environmental activists marched around the headquarters of Estonia’s State Forestry Management Centre (RMK). They were protesting against the mass clear-cutting of Estonian forests, in spite of warnings from prominent scientists and environmental organisations. The rebels disobediently planted an oak tree to symbolise the need to care for our forests instead of turning them into quick profits for corrupt institutions. Established in 1999, RMK made a profit of 43.2m euros in 2019 and was one of the top 10 companies in Estonia. 24 JUNE | Gdansk, Poland Rebels outside the Board of Education in Gdańsk. Together with the Polish Youth Climate Strike, they were protesting education material prepared by the Ministry of National Education in which global warming is described as bringing benefits to the planet! Photo: Pamela Gasiorowski. 27 JUN | Place de l’Europe, Lausanne, Switzerland Doctors for XR Switzerland held a powerful symbolic performance in Lausanne to highlight links between ecological catastrophe and human health problems, including the spread of infectious diseases like Covid-19. More than 80 medical rebels in white coats and doctors’ paraphernalia gathered at the Place de l’Europe to lead a funeral procession with coffin, skull and stained-glass sand timer before lying down dead in the shape of the XR logo to represent the dangers of global heating. 12-21 JUNE | Germany Discobedience on the Oberbaum Bridge, Berlin Last month saw XR Germany launch its Rebellion Wave, a 9-day action extravaganza organised by groups across the country. The decentralised wave encompassed both digital and physical disruption. Highlights included blocking access to coal-fired power plants and mass ‘discobedience’ in central Berlin. 50 rebels block access to the Lippendorf coal-fired power plant near Leipzig. 27 JUNE | Prague, Czech Republic ‘Let’s have a picnic in Prague Castle’. Concluding a series of socially-distanced actions since early May, Czech Republic rebels keep demanding that President Zeman meets with them to discuss the climate crisis. share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/07/16/newsletter-41/,"Dear rebels, Exciting times on the frontlines of change. XRUK has announced the next UK Rebellion. For further details, or to see how you can get involved, check out the Rebellion FAQ. Also this month, France sees the results of its first Citizens’ Climate Assembly, aimed at drastically reducing greenhouse gases while addressing climate and social justice. This is a massive step in the right direction for those of us fighting for the future of humanity and the planet. Citizens’ Assemblies are a fair and sustainable way to find solutions to the Climate and Ecological Crisis. They focus on bringing the choices directly to the people - without lobbying of fossil fuel firms and interference of party politics. In order to further understand their nuance and importance, we’ve put together a juicy selection of articles in our Must Reads section. We bring you news of a glorious wave of protest across Europe. Multiple creative actions and many dozens of arrests have helped alert the public and the government to the urgency of the situation. See highlights below and check out our Unchained for a full rundown. Also, we hear the latest from Australia, where rebels were getting hot under the collar in response to the government's drive toward a ‘gas-led recovery’. And in Hong Kong, just days before the controversial national security legislation, rebels staged a graveyard action to highlight the daily deaths from toxic air pollution. Be sure to read our Upcoming section for a powerful new global action highlighting the courage and plight of Indigenous communities in Brazil. And in line with the topic of assemblies, be sure to tune in this weekend for the Global Assembly for the Amazon. Finally, we introduce this outstanding broadcast from XR Africa News Online. If you’d like to help, please check out our website and learn more about XR. To connect to rebels in your local area, get in touch with your nearest XR group. If there’s no active group near you, you can start your own! If you’d like to see previous newsletter issues, you can find them here. This Rebellion needs your support. If you can’t give time, consider giving money. Support the Rebellion 18 JUN | France Buried in Coronavirus news over the past few months, hugely exciting things have been happening in France. The world's first major citizens' climate assembly has been hard at work since October 2019. On 18 June they presented their proposals for addressing the climate emergency. The Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat (CCC) is an independent committee of 150 French citizens drawn by lot to reflect French diversity, with a mandate to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 while advancing social justice. Convention members were divided into working groups to tackle a range of social and economic issues and worked closely with climatologists and economists, as well as economic and social organisations. The CCC has submitted 149 proposals to Macron, including: measures addressing transport, energy, agriculture, and construction; constitutional amendments to prioritise biodiversity; the creation of a new body responsible for enforcing planetary limits; and a strong call to make ecocide a crime by national referendum. Organisers from the Stop Ecocide campaign have praised the outcome as phenomenal news. 27 JUN | Brussels, Belgium Resilience Tower in Brussels. Photo:@XR_Belgium 60 brave Belgian rebels were arrested in Brussels while carrying out a symbolic baptism of the city’s Finance Tower. The tower had its name removed and was re-christened the Resilience Tower. Each rebel carried a sign highlighting elements of our current society that we need to leave behind and those we need to strengthen. Police blocked rebels' attempts to continue their protest outside the Prime Minister's office and arrested 60 of their number. It was the culmination of 14 days of actions across Belgium, stopping a ‘return to business as normal’ and calling for reflection on the needs of society. One rebel said: “We need to pause and think about what our needs are for the future. Do we want to return to a system based on fossil fuels, industrial agriculture, human exploitation and structural racism? Or work towards a resilient society that recognises the urgency of the crises that await us?” 7 JUL | Goulburn, Australia Rebels staged a dramatic ‘Now we’re Cooking the Planet with Gas’ action outside the constituency office of the Energy Minister in Goulburn, New South Wales. They were protesting the government-appointed National Covid-19 Coordination Commission’s push for a ‘gas-led recovery’. The NCCC is headed by and stacked with gas industry executives. Natural gas consists mostly of methane, the second most significant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and a key driver of the climate crisis. 28 JUN | Hong Kong XR Hong Kong staged a graveyard action to protest the destruction caused by air pollution. 35 pairs of shoes were laid out to symbolize the 35 people who lose their life from toxic air every week in Hong Kong. The city’s air pollutants consistently exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization. Worldwide, outdoor air pollution kills more people than tobacco smoking. As one rebel put it: “Pollution kills not only humans but all forms of life. The inaction of leaders is unacceptable.” Two days later, Beijing’s controversial national security law came into force. Thus curtailing the right to protest and risking the safety of activists in Hong Kong. “XR Hong Kong unwaveringly supports the fight of the Hong Kong people,” the group said. “Protecting human rights is protecting human lives.” People worldwide have shown their support for the people of Hong Kong. In the UK, rebels blocked access to an arms factory to oppose exports of UK-manufactured rubber bullets and tear gas used to suppress demonstrations in Hong Kong. 29 JUN | Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport, Sweden ‘Save the World or Aviation’. Photo: XR Sverige. A SAS domestic flight was delayed for an hour at Ängelholm–Helsingborg Airport, when a brave XRSweden rebel ‘superhero’ glued herself to the plane. On the day Swedish airports reopened, rebels protested government bailouts of the aviation industry as part of its Covid-19 recovery. The rebels called on Sweden to stop funding polluters and use public money to invest in green jobs and design a sustainable economy. They said: “Our action was not directed at airline workers or individual passengers. This is about the need to change the whole system.” The non-violent protest was part of Extinction Rebellion Europe’s Bail Out The Planet action wave. 5 rebels were briefly detained by the police. Photo: XR Sverige. In a second action on 29 June rebels delayed a SAS flight from Gothenburg to Stockholm by refusing to sit down. Rebels stated ‘These subsidies mean that Sweden cannot live up to the Paris Agreement and its own climate goals (...) Just as I would break a car window on a hot day to save a child or a dog, I sound an alarm because we are in a planetary emergency.’ The rebels now face fines and up to 6 months in jail. Once again we have too many actions for one newsletter. To catch up on all the actions that have been happening around the world - and especially during Europe's week-long wave of actions - you’ll have to read XR Unchained. It’s choc full of beauty, courage, and inspiration. 30 JUN | Khartoum, Sudan Rebels from XR Sudan demonstrate in Khartoum. 9 JUL | Canterbury, New Zealand The giant global dairy corporation Fonterra was greeted with drums, cow costumes, placards and a pile of coal, as XR Ōtautahi (Christchurch) asked the question: Why are Fonterra still using coal in a climate emergency? 3 JUL | Ibiza, Spain XR Ibiza put their heads in the sand at Playa d’en Bossa “to alert citizens and request urgent media and institutional action in the face of the Climate Emergency.” Read full Unchained here. 28 AUG & 01 SEP | London, Wales (TBC) From September 1st we will peacefully blockade the UK Parliament in London and Cardiff until they promise that the first thing they'll do is pass our 3 demands into law.

Now, more than ever, it’s time to rebel. The last few weeks have seen a near-endless parade of atrocities which only serve to highlight the injustices and social inequalities of our time. This statement from XRISN focuses on the need for XR to be an ‘umbrella canopy’ with diversity and freedom at its core. Ultimately, it is our duty as rebels (and as human beings) to work toward making the world a safer, fairer, and greener place. Yet amid all the sadness and tumult, there are some bright things happening. Have you seen The Gigantic Change, featuring the wonderful Whoopi Goldberg? How about The Condor & The Eagle; a fresh new documentary bringing Indigenous voices to the forefront of our narrative? Also, we have news of upcoming actions in Europe and ongoing ones in India. Today’s focus is on rebel activities in Kenya, where XR Africa is fighting to halt the destruction of a precious wild space, the Nairobi National Park, which is under threat from a luxury tourist resort in direct violation of the 2030 National Wildlife Strategy. Read up below, and also - exciting news, XR Africa now has their very own newsletter. Read it here and please subscribe! In Indonesia we catch up with a group of inspiring young rebels who staged a successful digital rebellion, highlighting the underhand tactics of its parliament to pass a secretive Coal and Mineral Mining Bill. And in France, over 50 rebels were arrested in one day of peaceful, socially distanced protesting for greater focus on our planet’s needs. Be sure to check out the Unchained for an array of more brave and beautiful actions from across the globe. Our announcements section is bursting with ways to educate yourself and get involved, whether that’s helping out with the new website redesign or sending stories to the Writers Rebel or Creative Hub. Finally, as we come tentatively out of lockdown and into the next stage of unknown, the only certainty is that we won't give up rebelling for the Earth, for all life, and for justice.

The park is a rare haven for wildlife in a busy city; the world’s only natural wildlife park in the midst of a capital. It is home to Kenya’s only black rhino sanctuary, as well as lions, buffalos and over 400 bird species. The park also functions as an important carbon sink helping to purify the air in a city where air pollution costs many lives. Photo: African Sustainability Network Part of a vital migration route to plains beyond it, the park was once a channel for the mass migrations of zebras, wildebeests and giraffes. But with the development of oil pipelines, railways, roads and extensive fencing, the number and variety of wild species populating the park has fallen drastically. The park is now threatened by further developments, including a luxury tourist resort in rhino breeding grounds and a plan to fully enclose the park. These proposals contradict the 2030 National Wildlife Strategy recently adopted by the government which aims to sustain natural habitats and reduce biodiversity loss. A founder of the African Sustainability Network and fierce defender of the park explained: “Utter destruction will occur if this goes ahead, converting the park into nothing more than a glorified zoo... Ancestral lands and wildlife diversity will be diminished through inbreeding, territorial reduction, culling and habitat encroachment” These developments must be stopped.

Each day a new digital ‘quest’ was launched on Instagram - a climate-related challenge that included attending zoom seminars, answering questionnaires, and making pieces of protest artwork. You can watch some highlights here. The quests drew in thousands of Indonesians, with hundreds posting their responses each day. Many of the new recruits are school age and are now setting up a national XR Youth chapter, as well as filming their own ‘Heading for Extinction’ talk. The digital event was launched after the government held an extraordinary parliamentary session, in contravention of its own lockdown rules, to pass a secretive Coal and Mineral Mining Bill. The new laws sideline environmental protections and encourage rampant extractivism. Last year, mining was linked to 7 natural disasters that killed dozens and displaced tens of thousands. This year the country has been devastated by floods and forest fires. Yet the media continues to ignore the climate crisis, and most Indonesians are still not properly informed about the wider links. 30 MAY | Paris, France On May 30, 58 French rebels were arrested, bussed to a police station, and fined after blocking the most iconic street in Paris, the Champs-Elysees. Many more were roughly dragged away by the police. The 150 strong blockade was part of a socially-distanced action called ‘Nos Besoins’ (Our Needs) highlighting the real needs of the world after the pandemic, such as clean seas and an ecological society, not a return to the old economic ‘abnormality’. 31 MAY & 4 JUNE | Germany & Czech Republic While Czech rebels were celebrating the shutdown of one of Europe’s dirtiest coal-fired power stations, rebels across Europe were protesting the launch of a brand-new one in Germany. On 4th June the state-owned Prunerov 1 power station near the town of Kadan, north-west of Prague, was finally closed down. According to a 2007 study by the World Wildlife Fund, Prunéřov was Europe’s 12th worst power station in terms of its energy efficiency and CO2 output. Four days earlier the controversial Datteln4 power station near Dortmund had been started up, with its operator Uniper claiming it to be among the world’s most modern and efficient coal-fired power plants. But as protestors made clear, it is still burning coal and still adding to the burden of CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere. Greta Thunberg called it “a shameful day for Europe”. Once again we have too many actions for one newsletter. To catch up on all the actions that have been happening around the world you’ll have to read XR Unchained. It’s choc full of beauty, courage, and inspiration. On June 7, inspired by the recent Trafalgar Square protest in the UK, Ecuadorian rebels lay down shoes outside the National Assembly, the house of Government in the capital Quinto.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/06/18/xr-unchained-15/,"15 MAY | Christchurch, New Zealand Ten rebels from Extinction Rebellion Christchurch (Ōtautahi) took a colourful stand against Bathurst Resources Ltd’s plan to increase production from its open-cast coal mine at Coalgate and extend its life from 2022 to 2035. The bulk of the coal goes to heat and dry milk powder at Fonterra dairy factories. Fonterra Co-operative Group, a multinational dairy company owned by around 10,500 New Zealand farmers, is responsible for approximately 30% of the world's dairy exports and is New Zealand's largest company. 7 JUN | Quito, Ecuador Masked and distanced rebels placed pairs of shoes on the road outside Ecuador’s National Assembly to remember those who have died defending nature and human rights in the country. They include: José Tendetza, from the Shuar people of Tundayme, murdered for defending their land. Edgar Yucailla, a peasant leader in Guamote, killed during the National Strike last year. Enrique Piaguaje, a traditional doctor from the Siekopai people, who died during the Covid-19 pandemic due to state negligence. 6 JUNE | Rome, Italy Roman rebels stood on the parapet of Ponte Sant'Angelo, an ancient bridge crossing the river Tiber, to show how humanity is on the edge of climate collapse. They held up signs telling their government to stop procrastinating and fulfil its moral duty to protect the Italian people from disaster. You can watch a beautiful video of this bold action.

The Croatian government part owns INA and recently extended its permits to drill for oil and gas in and around the Adriatic sea. 19 MAY | Europe On the day the Royal Dutch Shell oil company held a virtual Annual Shareholders meeting at its headquarters in The Hague, rebels and Shell Must Fall activists across Europe blocked Shell petrol stations and held a series of protests and demonstrations.

The sign reads: “Shell already knew it in 1986” 1 JUN | Horse Hill, near Gatwick Airport, UK From before dawn brave rebels blocked the entrance to the Horse Hill oil fracking site operated by UK Oil & Gas Investments (UKOG) to protest the continued extraction of fossil fuels and prevent tankers going in and out. 5 JUN | Budapest, Hungary On World Environment Day Hungarian rebels poured oil on the Earth in order to draw attention to the need for systemic change. “The fossil energy industry,” they said, “is taking us closer and closer to a climate catastrophe at an accelerating pace. We demand that policymakers prioritize a green and fair transition rather than bailing out polluting companies!” Photo: Péter Lakatos 21 MAY | New York City, USA Physically distancing activists brought a hot air balloon to Black Rock headquarters in New York to tell its boss, Larry Fink, that the company is full of hot air on climate! In January Fink announced that Black Rock, the world’s largest investment corporation with $7 trillion in assets, would reduce its investments in carbon-intensive energy companies. American rebels say this is just a load of greenwash. 22 May, San Francisco 29 MAY | Oslo, Norway Rebels went to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, the Ministry of Climate and Environment, and the Storting (parliament) to protest against the Norwegian government’s ‘green’ crisis package. Only 3.6 billion Norwegian krone were set aside for green initiatives, whereas the oil industry has received 100 billion and the airline industry 6 billion. XR Norway said: “The Norwegian authorities consistently choose industry and short-term profits ahead of climate and the environment. The ‘green transition’ is in reality black. Norway continues to fuel global overheating and does little for ecosystems in crisis.” 29 MAY | Spain Spanish activists placed pairs of shoes in front of town halls in Madrid (above) and 10 other cities to demand citizen participation in developing a green recovery from the pandemic. 5 JUN | Athens, Greece Greek rebels continue to demand the withdrawal of the so-called Modernization of Environmental Legislation law which in fact withdraws environmental regulations, permitting oil exploration in Greek waters and construction in protected parts of the countryside. “Come to Parliament! It is dawn and now we need you more than ever to be able to continue! We kept the road closed all night! The road remains closed for 12 hours!

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/05/20/newsletter-39/,"Photo: Anthony Jarman Dear rebels, Since its inception, a central goal of our movement has been to bring thousands of people from all walks of life out onto the streets, day after day, to peacefully engage in civil disobedience. This is how we wooed the world's media, shifted public consciousness, and brought complacent government representatives to the table. Now Covid has brought that tactic to a temporary, yet possibly lengthy, close. The streets of our capitals are no longer a safe place for mass protest, however noble the cause. But us rebels are a restless and ingenious lot! This issue we report on a new kind of mass disruption - the digital kind. Groups in both Denmark and Australia have launched digital disruption campaigns that have drawn in rebels from all over the world. Using their laptops and phones, and specially coded software, hundreds of synchronised rebels have bombarded websites, swarmed social media, and email blitzed major polluters and their enablers. But they are not the only actions that we should be excited about this month. Whether it be the mass symbolism of thousands of empty shoes in Trafalgar Square and The Hague, shaming a government owned oil company in Zagreb, or fake oil spraying the headquarters of a polluter supporting bank, rebels are still finding bold and brilliant ways to tell the truth while staying socially distant. And on that note it is with some joy that we can announce the return of XR Unchained. There were so many beautiful actions this month that one newsletter just couldn't contain them all! It may be a time of isolation and lockdown, but now more than ever, the future is up for grabs. And it is wonderful to see this global movement grab that future with both hands. If you'd like to help, please check out our website and learn more about XR. To connect to rebels in your local area, get in touch with your nearest XR group.

If you can't give time, consider giving money. Support the Rebellion 6-9 MAY | Online Even when rebels can't take to the streets, we can take to the web. That's the message from XR Denmark, who recently launched an online blockade of top CO2 emitters. 'Online Blockade: Tell the Truth to Oil Companies' Danish rebels designed a web browser add-on (see below) to overwhelm selected polluters with a barrage of web requests. Each request contained messages from a recent UN environmental report calling for urgent action. The action was the digital equivalent of queueing up at McDonalds and ordering the non-existent vegan, zero-waste Happy Meal again and again. Rebels targeted a different polluter each day, including fossil fuel companies Shell and BP, shipping company Maersk, and the Danish Finance Ministry for its recent bailout of Scandinavian Airlines. The 'Tell The Truth' web browser add-on Those involved in the disruption came from far outside Denmark, with rebels from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Finland, Germany, Australia, the UK and Poland all getting in on the digital action. 10-20 MAY | Australia While Australians were focused on saving lives from Covid-19, the Australian government was pushing forward with more fossil fuel activity. XR Australia has launched a digital rebellion to fight back during lockdown. The digital rebellion focuses on four pillars: make mass mischief online, challenge the toxic system with just alternatives, target industries doing the world harm, and spread kindness and build community through mutual aid. Last week 100 rebels 'swarmed' every social post made by Australia's four major banks, pointing out how they fund climate destruction. This new type of action was a huge success and shows that digitally, a few rebels can be both highly creative and create a lot of havoc. Today's final action called on rebels to paint the streets with the truth about the climate crisis while adhering to social distancing rules. On Monday rebels email and geo-blitzed an Environment minister and Peabody Energy for agreeing to a new coal mine under a major Sydney water reservoir. 17 APR - 18 MAY | The Hague & London 1000 pairs lined up in front of the Dutch parliament in The Hague. Photo: Catharina Gerritsen With mass demonstrations banned during lockdown, rebels in The Hague and London found a creative alternative- occupying public squares with empty shoes. Each pair symbolised a rebel in protest - a protest about governmental short-sightedness during this pandemic. Rebels from XR Netherlands filled the square outside the Dutch parliament with over 1000 pairs to protest the government's planned bailout of polluters, that includes the airline KLM and Schipol Airport. They also called for a Citizen's Assembly to decide on how to respond to the corona crisis and transition to a fairer and more sustainable future. In London, rebels occupied Trafalgar Square with over 2000 pairs of children's shoes. They called on the government to act on the climate crisis during the corona virus recovery so that children and young people aren't left to suffer an even deeper crisis. Trafalgar Square, London. Photo: Anthony Jarman Dr Deepa Shah, a doctor in London said: ""We're living through one of those rare moments in history when everything can change. British people have shown throughout this crisis how deeply we value our health and well-being. ""There are now multiple paths before us; we could choose to go back to our destructive past, or we could choose a future that gives our children a chance. Coronavirus will end but climate change is here to stay. Governments must act now to secure our future."" Shoes were donated by neighbours, parents and local teachers and will be donated to Shoe Aid. The Hague. Photo: Catharina Gerritsen 22 APR | Zagreb, Croatia Ban Jelačić Square. Photo: Matej Kožić The first of two actions by brave rebels of XR Zagreb took the form of an Earth Day message written in chalk across Ban Jelačić Square - 'Our home is in crisis, let's rebel, rebellion is love.' The second action targeted the Croatian oil company INA. Six months after the European Commission launched its Green Deal policy, which will cut carbon emissions and fossil fuel consumption across the EU over the next three decades, the Croatian Government, which owns a 45% stake in INA, signed a sponsorship contract with the company for its six months' Presidency of the EU. While making claims of sustainability to greenwash itself, the INA has recently invested 4 billion kuna (over 5 billion euro) in its refineries in Rijeka and Sisak. Zagreb rebels are calling for politicians to break their cosy ties to fossil fuel companies and listen to the scientific community. Rebels display a banner outside the INA headquarters: 'Renewable Energy for Saving the Earth'. Photo: Matej Kožić 7 MAY | London, UK Rebels unfurl their banner and cover the glass of Barclays London headquarters in fake oil On Friday 7 May, a trio of rebels undertook a socially distanced and face mask protected protest outside Barclays headquarters in London, the morning of the bank's Annual General Meeting. Spraying the building with fake oil, the message was simple: Barclays must abide by its own recently stated goals for a carbon neutral future, and end its obscene funding of fossil fuel interests – £95 billion in the last three years, the highest of any bank in Europe. Rebels also demanded that the bank works with global governments to help bring about the only realistic option for a post-Covid world: a green transition. This means not just divesting from fossil fuels to curb global carbon emissions, but also immediate investment in zero carbon options. With oil prices at an all-time low and the industry reeling, now is the time. Who would have thought that we'd have too many actions for one newsletter during lockdown? You amaze us, rebels. Keep it up! Please have a read of the full XR Unchained for more beautiful and courageous actions we couldn't fit in this issue. Clockwise from top left: Seebrucke, Dresden, Heidelberg. In a continuing campaign, German and Austrian rebels have been taking over city parking spaces to replace cars with planters, many with built-in bicycle stands. Urban gardening, they say, ensures a better quality of life, strengthens social relationships and increases a city's self-sufficiency. In the German city of Saarbrucken members of XR and Animal Rebellion turned two of the city's fountains a 'poisonous green' colour in order to 'make the climate catastrophe visible'. The placard reads 'Climate Politics is Poisoning Us!' In the UK rebels in St Ives, Cornwall, have started a No Going Back Sundays movement. Wearing masks and observing social distancing, they display home-made placards in a prominent local setting every Sunday at 10am. The idea has quickly spread to other parts of the country, and beyond. Rebels in Cambridge and across the UK also made their streets bike-friendly by adding new cycling lanes.

XR Internationalist Solidarity Network, which bridges XR with grassroots resistance movements in the Global South, along with XR Youth UK and African Voices Forum, have teamed up to host an online mini-series of live Pan-Afrikan panel discussions. The final talk, 'Women's Voices', will address the struggles of women who have been displaced due to conflict and climate change in Afrika and the Global South. The female activists speaking at the event will be announced later this week. The first two panel discussions, 'The Global Black Experience of Ecocide' and 'Youth In Action', can be watched now by following the links. 30 MAY| Your Local Politician's Office As lockdowns across the world begin to ease, we stand at crossroads. Prioritise health or prioritise profit. We have a choice. Bail out people and planet or bail out the industries that are killing us. We have a choice. Trust the people or trust governments with our future. We have a choice. It's time to trust the people and decide together how we respond to the corona crisis and prepare for further crises so this never happens again. As part of the coronavirus recovery, we demand a binding Citizens Assembly on how to rebuild our economy, our democracy and our future. On Saturday 30 May, bring this message to your local politician's office or local authority. Make sure to follow Covid-19 guidelines, come alone, wear a mask, and stand strictly 3 metres apart. This action is organised by XR UK, but we hope rebels across the world will take part on the same day. Find out more here.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/05/05/nature-rights/,"Article by Andrew Jones On 2 August 2014, the 500,000 residents of Toledo, Ohio woke up to a city alert. ""Urgent Water Notice! DO NOT DRINK THE WATER. DO NOT BOIL THE WATER."" Hours later, local shops had sold out of bottled water. Toledoans scattered as far as 100 km (62 miles) from the city in search of water. Algal blooms in Lake Erie, the 10th largest freshwater lake in the world, had infused Toledo's tap water with microcystin, a potent toxin that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and liver failure. In the past few decades, excessive phosphorus and nitrogen have spilled into the lake and fueled runaway toxic algal growth. Signs warning ""DANGER. Avoid all contact with water"" have become summer mainstays for western Lake Erie beaches. Water sample from Lake Erie taken Sept 2017 (Photo Credit: NOAA GLERL) Describing the algae, local boater Dave Spangler commented, ""It gets so thick that it slows the boats,"" and compared the smell to ""Grandma's basement, that musty smell."" The blooms affect more than just drinking water. Mats of algae block sunlight from reaching underwater plants. When the algae die, the excessive biomatter sets off a frenzy of microbe activity that rapidly consumes the dissolved oxygen in the lake, suffocating all fish and aquatic life in the process. The resulting dead zone can span over a third of the lake. Agricultural runoff plays the main culprit. Modern fertilizer practices and vast piles of animal waste from concentrated animal feeding operations provide the excess phosphorus and nitrogen, while heavy rainstorms push those nutrients into the lake. Historically, people have found some success rallying against point-source pollution. If a city's sewage plant is spilling pollutants into the lake, that is relatively easy to target and remedy. But when the sources are thousands of independent agribusinesses spread across an entire watershed, pollution becomes practically—and politically—more difficult to regulate. For years, the people of Toledo pushed traditional legal channels to enforce existing regulations and write new ones to protect their drinking water, but to no avail. Frustrated by the inaction, they explored other avenues. In the past, groups have filed lawsuits to defend ecosystems from destruction, but more often than not, courts have ruled that the groups did not have sufficient legal standing to bring the suit. To have legal standing, you must suffer direct injury or harm. In response, some have moved to assign legal standing directly to nature. In 1972, law professor Christopher Stone penned the essay Should Trees Have Standing?—Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects. It may feel beyond our collective imagination to give nature rights. But, as Stone writes, ""throughout legal history, each successive extension of rights to some new entity has been… a bit unthinkable… Until the rightless thing receives its rights, we cannot see it as anything but a thing for the use of ‘us'—those who are holding rights at the time."" Giving rights to nature would have immediate implications. For a market system to function, businesses must be held accountable for the costs they impose on people downstream. But the effects of pollution on humans are often too diffuse to give the law a proper toehold. Stone specifically referenced the pollution of Lake Erie in the 1970s as an example. In considering the downstream costs, Stone argued we should stretch beyond narrowly defined ""homocentric interests"" to include the death and suffering of non-human life. It could be more simple than it sounds. The legal system creates economic value through what it protects. Private property and copyrights have value only because of the law's recognition. In the same way, a lake is given value when the law enforces penalties against those who violate the lake's rights. In recent years, more people have been turning to Stone's argument in an effort to achieve meaningful change. Since 2006, the Rights of Nature have been made into law in cities and countries across the world. Ecuador became the first nation to recognize the Rights of Nature in its constitution in 2008. The constitutional article begins, ""Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycle, structure, functions, and evolutionary processes. All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature."" In other words, anybody can go to court to protect life, regardless of the plaintiff's legal standing. Going further than protection against further harm, the article states ""Nature has the right to be restored."" Bolivia followed in 2010 with the ""Law of the Rights of Mother Earth."" The law defines Mother Earth as ""the dynamic living system formed by the indivisible community of all life systems and living beings who are interrelated, interdependent, and complementary, which share a common destiny."" In 2017, New Zealand granted legal personhood to the Whanganui River, making it the first river in the world to be recognized as an indivisible and living being. A court in India carried the example forward by declaring the Ganges River and its Yamuna tributary ""legal and living entities."" Whanganui River (Photo Credit: Duane Wilkins) The recognition has persisted beyond symbolism into the courtroom. In 2011, haphazard road construction along the Vilcabamba River in Ecuador threatened downstream ecosystems. Excavated material and debris were discarded into the river. The scarring of hillsides increased erosion, and the ensuing blockages altered her path and increased her flow. Large floods barreled through, destroying ecosystems, risking landslides, and affecting access to clean water. Rather than argue for personal damages, people downstream filed a constitutional lawsuit on behalf of the river. And the provincial court ruled in favor of the Vilcabamba River. Still, ""happily ever after"" has eluded Rights of Nature advocates. People defending the river have struggled to get the Ecuadorian government to enforce the ruling. Meanwhile, oil drilling operations continue to expand into the Ecuadorian rainforest. The Bolivian government incentivizes the slash-and-burn agriculture that Bolivians blame for sparking unprecedented fires in the Chiquitano dry forest. The Supreme Court of India overturned the earlier ruling, stating that giving legal rights to rivers was ""legally unsustainable."" Conversely, the Whanganui River's personhood has so far garnered more respect. The bill is the culmination of a century of struggle by the indigenous peoples, the Maori, and recognizes the intertwined fates of the people and of the river. Among other innovations, its comprehensive framework provides for a human council to directly oversee the river's interests. In turn, the global movement inspired the Toledoans for Safe Water, a grassroots group on the shore of Lake Erie, to write the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (LEBOR). Harmful Algal Bloom in Lake Erie: September 20, 2017 (Photo Credit: Aerial Associates Photography, Inc. by Zachary Haslick) The bill states, ""it has become necessary that we... extend legal rights to our natural environment in order to ensure that the natural world, along with our values, our interests, and our rights, are no longer subordinated to the accumulation of surplus wealth and unaccountable political power."" After years of rallying public support around LEBOR, the city of Toledo granted legal rights to Lake Erie in 2019. Whereas many other Rights of Nature advances were instituted by courts or legislatures, the people of Toledo passed LEBOR with 61% of the vote. Less than 11 hours after LEBOR passed, Drewes Farms Partnership and the State of Ohio brought a suit against the City of Toledo, challenging LEBOR as unconstitutional and unlawful. Drewes Farms' lawsuit is remarkable in that it goes to such lengths to explain how LEBOR prevents them from running their business as it currently operates. This is precisely LEBOR's motivation. Because Drewes Farms is correct. No real mitigation to excess runoff can be made without fundamentally changing our approach to agriculture with its vast monocropping, excessive artificial fertilizers, million-dollar, 65-ton tractors with 1,000-gallon diesel tanks, and cramped complexes of suffering animals. This is not to belittle the plight of Drewes Farms. From its perspective, it has responded to market constraints for decades to eke out a profit in a commoditized business. To survive, it probably loaded itself with debt in order to subdue more land with bigger machines. It had been judged only by its ability to turn a profit. But now, an upstate town was trying to burden it with new demands? To comply with the full intention of LEBOR would require extraordinary help. Million-dollar machines with million-dollar debts might be rendered unusable. LEBOR does nothing to help it. The two sides presented oral arguments in January 2020. Drewes Farms and the State of Ohio have been forced to juggle contradictory arguments. They argue Toledo has no right to reach beyond its jurisdiction to protect its drinking water, but claim that the state and businesses have the right to pollute beyond their borders. At the heart of the case is ""Whose rights prevail?"" The rights of the people of Toledo to clean water? The rights of the Lake Erie ecosystem to ""exist, flourish, and naturally evolve""? Or the rights of Drewes Farms and their colleagues to operate as they always have? The broader the umbrella of rights, the more frequently those rights will come into conflict. And then, which right should be given priority? The Rights of Nature movement is an attempt to recenter our priorities. It claims that protecting access to the essentials of life—clean air and clean water—is a higher priority than a corporation's access to private property and profit, that a living ecosystem's right to exist is a higher priority than humanity's right to exploit life without recourse. The movement is opposed by powerful, entrenched interests. But its power lies in its simplicity. To overturn LEBOR, a judge must rule that, in fact, no, the people of Toledo and the lake's ecosystem do not possess the right to a clean and healthy environment and that it is lawful for corporations and governments to deprive Lake Erie of such. Toward the end of ""Should Trees Have Standing?"" Christopher Stone moves beyond the practical to the philosophical. He asks, ""What is it within us that gives us this need not just to satisfy basic biological wants, but to extend our wills over things, to objectify them, to make them ours, to manipulate them, to keep them at a psychic distance?"" Our view of nature as objects to be dominated has led to the destruction of land and life. And this mindset is echoed in our law's treatment of other life. Stone saw the reinforcement of our ""separateness"" from nature as inhibiting our personal growth as moral beings. Stone recalls the Supreme Court's role in undoing the racial segregation of schools in the U.S., reminding us that the ruling's cultural importance swelled beyond its practical consequences. The ruling ""awakened us to moral needs which, when made visible, could not be denied."" In the same way, giving legal rights to nature can be a crucial step toward recentering our relationship with life.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/04/08/newsletter-38/,"A time of crises: C-19 and the Climate and Ecological Breakdown. Read how rebels are adapting to difficult times and see our list of announcements to get involved. Dear rebels, We hope you’re keeping well in these strange times. It’s been a difficult month for many of us, with Covid-19 dominating the global conversation. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of C-19 is the struggle to live in this new world of distancing and isolation. It’s important to remember then, that we are in this together, as a movement and a species. There is a humility in the way Covid unites us all - regardless of country, creed or colour. In this at least, it parallels the Climate and Ecological crisis. Read on to see how rebels are evolving to the situation: with Global Support launching the ‘Love & Rage in Times of Corona’ campaign, and AloneTogether in the UK - there are more ways than ever to stay involved and connected. This month we also celebrate Earth Day, and look back at the anniversary of our first International Rebellion. We are struck by how different life is twelve months later, as we face not one, but two global crises, yet we find hope in the response, as communities come together to share and support each other. Also in this issue, we take a look at XR NYC’s April Fool’s event and catch up with dancing rebels in Italy. There’s good news from the Standing Rock, and a beautiful ‘Exploring XR’ piece from rebels in Uganda braving the law to stand up for the Earth. Finally, we introduce a new element to the global newsletter: ‘Pandemic Picks’ invites you to get into the quarantine routine with a carefully crafted list of inspiring books, films and tunes chosen by your very own newsletter team. Send us your suggestions. Until next month, stay safe rebels. Stay brave.

Support the Rebellion Ongoing | Worldwide In order to save lives, people around the world are enacting personal distancing measures. Airlines in Europe have reduced flights by 75% to 85%; global long-haul airlines have cut flights by up to 96%. Almost every cruise line has paused operation until April, May, or even 2021. Global in-city travel has also dropped drastically, up to 97% as of 26 March. People aren’t driving to work or to shops. Many public transit systems have also reduced or halted services. This halt in travel will save people from becoming infected with Covid-19. It also provides us with a preview of what our planet could look like with drastic emissions reduction. China’s 25% reduction in emissions in February was the equivalent of a half-year of emissions for the UK. Air pollution in the UK is lower than the previous 5 years average after the lockdown was implemented. When countries stimulate their economies after a crisis, the emissions that result can destroy all the climate gains made by the slow period. This happened in China in 2009 after the global economic crash. When COVID-19 is behind us, let’s find ways to continue these reductions and mitigate the damage of climate change. 1 APRIL | Online Playing a cool double bluff, XR New York City rebels masquerading as Google released an online statement declaring that in lieu of their normal April Fools joke, the multinational tech giant would stop funding climate denial.” The mock website featured Google style graphics and links to genuine articles substantiating Google’s role in spreading climate misinformation. An apology was issued for ‘putting profit over the planet’ followed by a pledge to push a ‘zero tolerance policy for climate change denial among our partners.’ In the light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the idealised ‘Google’ also acknowledged how ignoring science can result in suffering on a global scale. Finally, they suggested joining Extinction Rebellion to become part of the solution. 25 March | North Dakota, USA An environmental battle which gripped the world’s attention back in 2016 was reignited last week, when a federal judge ordered a fresh review of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have won a significant legal battle for a fresh environmental review of the pipeline, which began moving oil through their territory, and crucially under the sacred Lake Oahe in 2017. Flags fly at the Oceti Sakowin Camp near Cannonball, North Dakota. Photo: Lucas Zhao A bitter contest has raged between thousands of indigenous activists and allies with police over the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe are worried that a spill would pollute water they rely on for fishing, drinking and religious ceremonies. Back in 2016, youth from Standing Rock and surrounding Native American communities stopped the construction of the pipeline by occupying the site and organising mass protests. As camps and public outrage grew, the Obama administration announced that the Army Corps of Engineers would need to seek alternate routes. But just four days into office, Trump approved the construction of the pipeline .. In his ruling, the Washington Federal Judge stated that “too many questions remain unanswered” over the impact of the pipeline on communities in the area, and that the unreviewed environmental effects are “highly controversial.” The Sioux Tribe and Earthjustice, who represent them in court, have hailed the decision as a “significant legal win” and their attorney said that the tribe will be seeking to shut down the pipeline while reviews are carried out. 20 MAR | Italy Isolated rebels across Italy have found some light in the darkness by turning their balconies into dance floors and staging a synchronised discobedience. XR Italy teamed up with Fridays For Future Italia to organise the balcony boogie, and the two groups are planning more Friday actions as the nationwide quarantine continues. Italy has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Throughout this crisis, XR Italy has remained highly active online and is now welcoming a surge of new recruits. In just one week, their online induction meetings have drawn interest from over a thousand people, and every 50 person session they schedule gets booked up within the hour. Asked what might have caused this surge in interest, a coordinator in Rome felt the lockdown had given many people the time to reflect on larger social issues like the environment and our consumerist culture, and how these link to public health. There is a growing awareness in Italy that this pandemic is being linked to man’s exploitation of nature and that destroying animals and their habitats may have paved the way for this virus to move to human hosts. Even with scientific opinion behind them, XR Italy realises this is a difficult message that needs to be delivered with delicacy. Italy is in the midst of a true tragedy. Over fifteen thousand have died, and social distancing guidelines make traditional funerals impossible. In a country ready for systemic change, Italian rebels are determined to start a vital conversation with their fellow citizens. Hospital workers in Bari demand we protect ecosystems to stop contact with new pathogens. Uganda XR Uganda setting off to Mbale district Eastern Uganda to mark International Women’s Day XR Uganda was founded by a teacher in 2019, and its numbers have been steadily growing ever since. The Ugandan rebel we spoke to, an IT professional, was the second person to join the group. “I was researching the shocking number of suicides by Indian farmers whose crops had failed as a result of climate change. I came across the XR website and thought, let me sign up and be a part of this team.” Uganda has been radically altered by climate change. Temperatures are rising. Groundwater is disappearing. In some regions, spring wells and village boreholes have dried up completely. Lack of rain has brought drought, with unpredictable seasons leading to shifts in planting patterns. Floods and landslides, caused by deforestation, degradation of wetlands, and poor farming methods, have resulted in forced migration across Uganda. The country already hosts the largest amount of refugees in Africa. XR Uganda Children XR Uganda is considered illegal as it isn’t registered as a community based organisation, NGO or business. Rebels believe the authorities fear that the movement will sponsor individuals to stand against the ruling political party. But the Ugandan rebels remain optimistic. They are taking their message to communities and schools, engaging children while demanding access to quality education for all and highlighting how the climate breakdown has a disproportionate impact on women. The message from our rebel contact is clear: “XR Uganda is rising up - watch this space!” Love & Rage in Times of Corona is a global campaign exploring the human resilience and community building of rebels around the world. Showing how we are adapting and reimagining a new world now that we have confirmation that drastic change on a global scale is both possible and necessary.

Watch it here. Lesley Morrison, Doctors for XR “We are only as safe as our most vulnerable. The poor suffer most in both crises and we urgently need to address health and social inequalities. Global challenges need systemic change. Neither Covid nor climate pay attention to borders, the world is a small place, and we're all interconnected. This is the basis of planetary health. Prevention is better than cure. The role and crucial importance of scientific expertise needs to be, and has been, recognised. The cynicism and disregard for scientific expertise promoted by populist politicians has hopefully lost credibility. People are learning to trust and to value health and science professionals.” We are receiving amazing human stories and we want to know yours.

Dearest Rebels, This issue, we celebrate the incredible courage and kindness of women everywhere, from the Republic of Congo to the bridges of London, who are standing strong to honour each other and the Earth. If you haven’t already, check out this powerful video of women performing the protest dance called ‘Un Violador en Tu Camino’ (A Rapist in Your Path) for International Women’s Day. We take time to consider the very serious and ongoing threat that Coronavirus (Covid-19) poses to our activities and the planned Waves of Rebellion. Rebels have been working tirelessly to find a path which seeks to protect life, support the most vulnerable, and draw our communities together in a time of crisis. ‘Business as usual’ has been disrupted with a shocking jolt, and people everywhere are called on to do what we can to slow the progress of this pandemic. Advice from healthcare professionals and experts is to limit social contact and self-isolate to slow the spread of Coronavirus. Rebels are encouraged to hold meetings online wherever possible, and to think carefully before organising in-person gatherings. Slowing this virus down will make a big difference to how well we can care for people who are affected. By limiting our contact with others, where possible, we can relieve unnecessary strain on healthcare providers and save lives. As rebels, we can choose to engage with and support our local communities in this crisis. This is an opportunity to prefigure the world we want to build: one that chooses life and regeneration over despair and fear.

Support the Rebellion 8 MAR | Across Uganda, DRC, Nigeria & The Gambia XR Uganda organised a Women’s March in Mbale as part of International Women's Day 2020, planting trees and teaching children about the Emergency. Rebels highlighted how climate and ecological breakdown will impact women and the poorest communities the most. Women, such as those in Bududa, have been left ‘without anything - homeless, helpless, hopeless by unpredictable rains, floods and mud slides.’ Their situation is made worse by prolonged droughts, higher temperatures, increased crop failure, loss of livestock and increasing food insecurity. The Mbale march also focussed on the need for access to quality education. When breakdown and instability hit, more children are forced to abandon their education and more girls are pressured into child marriage. The brave women of Uganda are refusing to stand by and watch their future and their children’s future be lost. To achieve Climate Justice, we must focus on Social Justice. Mugunga, DRC Indigenous women in XR Hewa Bora surrounded a park warden camp and demanded an end to climate rape and sexual violence in the forest. XR Abuja celebrated International Women’s Day in Nigeria and held discussions around the challenges women face as a result of the climate crisis and the need for equality. 20-25 FEB | Venice, Italy The first Wave of Global Rebellion hit the canals of Venice last month, with rebels from across Italy carrying out a series of spectacular actions during the city’s annual carnival. The protests kicked off with a blindfolded flash mob performance. Blindfolded rebels stood in solemn silence as a speaker called on the carnival revellers to open their eyes to the climate crisis, and join their rebellion. Two days later, hundreds of rebels flooded the busy Venetian streets for a spot of joyful discobedience. The next morning, a group of rebels blockaded the Ponte dell’Accademia, a bridge spanning the city’s Grand Canal. The lock-in marked one of the first high-risk actions for XR Italy. Tensions were high as the rebels fitted into their arm tubes, but thanks to heartfelt chants and open dialogue, the blockade continued without violence. Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon and has already suffered extensive damage from the climate crisis. Much of the ancient city is flooded year after year. Will Venice become our next Atlantis? Yet the Italian government and local authorities have still not declared a climate emergency. Without major policy change, the UNESCO world heritage site appears doomed. Or as the Italian rebels put it: ‘There’s no carnival under the sea’. FEB | British Columbia, Canada Photo by Darryl Dyck / Canadian Press An ongoing surge of civil disobedience rolled across Canada in February. Protests began in British Columbia, where Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs blocked railways to protest the construction of a multi-billion-dollar pipeline through their unceded territory. After disturbing reports of forceful removal by police (as well as possible illegal restraint), these actions gained traction with Indigenous and solidarity protestors. Meanwhile, in Ontario and Quebec, Mohawks disrupted rail networks; in Vancouver, 38 people were arrested for blocking access to shipping ports; in Toronto, 37 were arrested for bringing the city's Union Station to a standstill at rush hour. Photo by Canadian Press/REX/Shutterstock Much of this burgeoning civil disobedience has taken inspiration from the initial actions of the Wet'suwet'en chiefs, with the focus point of strategy being rail blockades. This has caused disruption to construction work, passenger and freight transport, and to the Canadian economy at large. The scale of disruption is clearly evident with the news that Canada's two largest railways have been covertly sharing railway links, and have diverted some key routes through the US. The impact of this story has extended far beyond Canada with protests gaining support from groups all around the world. 1 MAR | Lamma Island, Hong Kong Dining in the South China Sea, Lamma Island, Hong Kong On a sunny Sunday afternoon, XRHK staged a ‘dinner party’ off a Hong Kong Beach among the waves as a reminder that – even though the media has shifted its attention to the coronavirus – we are still facing catastrophic ecological and climate breakdown. With the coal-fired Hong Kong power station as backdrop, rebels impersonated the 1%, “cheering to the end of the world as we know it, partying while climate change and associated natural disasters already kill the poorest and most vulnerable.” Specifically, rebels intended to highlight Hong Kong’s vulnerability, as a coastal city, to sea-level changes, and the city’s lack of a viable strategy to address the looming crisis. “The adopted strategy – to replace one fossil fuel by another, in this case coal by natural gas – is, while less carbon-intensive, ultimately highly counterproductive,’ To read more on XRHK follow them here or here. 27 FEB | London, UK Plans to expand Heathrow airport were ruled illegal because they clashed with the government’s commitments to tackle the climate crisis. The government must now either make a new proposal that is in line with the UK’s environmental targets or withdraw it entirely. This exciting ruling by the British Court of Appeal has global implications. It is the first time that climate targets made under the Paris Agreement have carried legal weight. The success of this court ruling gives some hope to the implementation of the Paris targets. If any other of the 188 nations that are party to the Agreement now green lights a high-carbon infrastructure project, there is a legal precedent to challenge the decision. There are far too many beautiful and courageous actions happening around the world for us to cover in each issue. Please have a read of our XR Unchained to catch up on the stories that we couldn’t squeeze in. 27 FEB | Jakarta, Indonesia.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/02/14/newsletter-36/,"Dearest rebels, Whether you swoon for Valentine’s Day or think it represents everything that’s wrong with the world, we hope you’ll accept this newsletter as a message of affection from us to you; putting the 'love' into 'Love and Rage'. Today, we are proud to announce that we will rise up in Waves of Rebellion across the world! At an exciting international meeting, rebels decided that countries will organise their own 'wave' in period of Rebellion that will cascade from April to June. With over a dozen countries already signed up and choosing their dates, Extinction Rebellion is set to send ripples right round the world! See Upcoming Activity for more info. In this issue, we zoom to The Netherlands, where 35 rebels were brutally arrested while protesting at Shell’s Headquarters; and to sunny Hollywood, where XR Youth LA join forces with Indigenous leaders to protest the total lack of climate awareness in the movie industry. In Munich, rebels teamed up with Indigenous speakers to crash Siemens' shareholder conference and protest its relentless funding of ecocidal activities. Meanwhile, Australian rebels were giving the media corporations a taste of their own medicine with some excellent and creative actions. XR UK released their 2020 Strategy, crystallising some key themes for the year ahead, in advance of XR UK's first big action of the year, 'Together We March' on 22Feb. We have a guide from XR Muslims on how to engage with Muslim communities. And, finally, in Humans of XR, we hear from an ex-probation officer who has been breaking the law for the good of the planet. To connect to rebels in your local area, get in touch with your nearest XR group. If there’s no active group near you, you can start your own! If you’d like to see previous newsletter issues, you can find them here. This Rebellion needs your support. If you can’t give time, consider giving once or becoming a regular donor. Support the Rebellion Back to top 31 JAN - 1 FEB | The Hague, Amsterdam, The Netherlands A brave group of rebels from XR Nederlands glued on to the entrance to Shell’s World Headquarters and splashed 'oil' on the front steps, as part of a coalition of activists called Shell Must Fall. The peaceful protest was met with unreasonable force when police stepped in and dealt blows with their batons, dragging the rebels from the site and arresting 35 of them. In one video, a police officer can be seen holding his hand over a rebel’s mouth while the man struggles to breathe. Some rebels were held well beyond the 9-hour legal limit, with the last rebel released after 48 hours. Shell claims its business strategy is in alignment with the Paris agreement. However, Documents from the 1980s and a public information film produced by Shell in 1991 clearly show that the company has long been aware of the threat posed by the use of fossil fuels and that it plans to continue to extract oil and gas. A clear example of a company putting short-term profit over the future of life and our planet. 08 FEB | Los Angeles, USA Hollywood, listen up: GLOBAL INFLUENCE = GLOBAL DUTY (Photo: Dennis Noack/SpectralQ) The day before the Academy Awards ceremony, XR Youth LA held a dramatic die-in under the iconic Hollywood sign. An organiser explains their target: “Hollywood is a global influencer, and what it does or doesn’t do sends a powerful message around the world. Hollywood has a moral duty to become Climate Emergency Storytellers.” Horrified by the 15 million tons of CO2 that Hollywood produces every year, XR Youth LA demands annual eco-audits and net-zero CO2 by 2025. (Photo: Summer Dean) As part of the die-in, the group invited Amazonian Indigenous Leader Sonia Guajajara to sit in the center of the human hourglass. The gesture, they said, ‘represents that Indigenous respect for nature holds the key to ending our Climate Emergency and ecological destruction.’ In addition to global consequences, XR Youth LA is sensitive to local concerns. ‘Environmental racism impacts many families in Los Angeles. Low income communities, often communities of color, are disproportionately forced to live right next to oil refineries and other fossil fuel infrastructure. ’ 05 FEB | Munich, Germany Rebels stage a “die-in” as Siemens shareholders arrive for the AGM (Photo: Helge Brügner) The Wangan and Jagalingou First Nation People are on the front line in the fight against the Adani Carmichael mine in Australia. With the capacity to export 700,000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every single year, this mega-mine would be an environmental disaster. Siemens is the only company left that is willing to provide the signalling systems for the mining operation. Despite worldwide pressure, Siemens has refused to cancel the contract. Australian activists travelled to Germany and were able to directly address shareholders at the Siemens AGM in Munich on the 5th February. Murrawah Johnson, Varsha Yarman and Dr. Lindsay Simpson spoke about the Emergency and the impact of the Adani mine. Fellow rebels onstage translated their speeches into German. Seven rebels locked on with superglue at the Siemens AGM. (Photo: Helge Brügner) Rebels showed up in force at the meeting - some staging a “die-in” at the entrance while seven other rebels locked-on inside the conference hall, and another rebel turned himself into a “security kangaroo” and hopped across the conference floor. Annemarie Botzki from XR Deutschland commented : ‘We will fight for our future, Siemens prides itself on taking the lead in the fight against the climate catastrophe and speaks of climate neutrality for 2030, and in fact the company continues to participate in climate-destroying projects.’ Lukas Schnermann added : ‘We therefore demand from Siemens' board members that they implement the contents of their PR methods and get out of all climate-damaging projects.’ 29 JAN - 1 FEB | Brisbane & Sydney, Australia On January 29, Australian rebels protested News Corp’s global campaign of climate denial and disinformation. They dumped a truckload of manure in front of the Brisbane headquarters to ‘return some of the bullsh*t that News Corp has been giving us.’ Then they glued themselves to the office doors. The group also posted a cheeky ad on Gumtree for the pile of free manure, saying ‘if it’s gone, there’s plenty more inside the building’! Screenshot of ad on Gumtree, Brisbane, Australia On February 1, hundreds of rebels protested Murdoch’s climate lies with a ‘lie-in’ protest in front of the Sydney News Corp headquarters. Murdoch’s climate denial and disinformation isn’t just an Australian problem. It’s a global threat. While Murdoch’s media empire controls 60% of newspapers sold in Australia, it also controls 36% of newspapers sold in the UK, 50% of cable news viewership (Fox News), plus the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post. It’s little surprise then that climate denial is unusually strong in these countries. Every Murdoch outlet has for decades pushed the message that says climate change doesn’t exist or doesn’t matter. Fortunately, we have a global network of truth-telling rebels who are committed to exposing lies, denial and corruption. Liars, watch out. XR Muslims has written a must-read guide for engaging with Muslim communities in the UK. The guide may spark ideas for rebels to engage with marginalized communities globally. Alessandra Palange pointed out that her document specifically addresses Muslim communities in the UK. ‘We need to keep in mind that we are up against wealthy, powerful transnational corporations and that the climate emergency knows no borders. It’s important to nourish identities that connect us beyond a limited understanding of national citizenship,’ says Palange. Nearly 25% of the world’s people are Muslim. Building bridges with Muslim communities is vital, whether it’s coordinated or aligned actions. The only effective way to act on climate is to embrace our diversity and work together. If you're part of a group that has been pushed to the margins and if you have written a similar outreach guide, we want to hear from you!

Back to top MAY - JUN | Worldwide 100% At the end of January, XR's Global Support (GS) hosted a call attended by 50 rebels from all around the globe. It was the first call in the history of XR where countries met and decided together how to rebel. We decided to create Waves of Global Rebellion during the same period (April - June) all over the world. Many groups have already set their dates: Venice - FEB 20, Netherlands - APRIL 13, Switzerland - APRIL 16, USA, Mexico City - APRIL 20, Africa Climate Week - Uganda - APRIL 20-24, Italy - APRIL 24, Finland, Germany, France, Australia, Canada - MAY 4, Austria - MAY 11, Spain - MAY 18, UK, Argentina, Ireland, Italy - MAY 23, Norway - JUNE 2, Sweden - JUNE 6, Hong-Kong - JUNE 7, Brussels - JUNE 12. Other groups are joining and sharing the dates of new Waves. This 'Wave of Rebellion' will build towards the strategy of mass disruption for COP26 in November. If you want to join a project group or add the next wave to the calendar, please write to us at events@organise.earth or join us on Mattermost. 22 FEB | 1 pm | London, UK We will march on our capital city, wearing our hearts on our sleeves.

This is the first time I have been charged with any offence and I have not found it easy putting myself in this situation … and appearing in court today on the other side of the fence from my previous professional appearances. I didn’t want to do this and found it hard knowing that our actions in April were causing disruption and inconvenience to many people’s lives. But I felt impelled to act in the face of the catastrophic future I saw unfolding before us all. I have long been concerned about climate change, and in the past attended demonstrations, signed petitions and wrote letters to my MP. But like many people, I only half accepted the magnitude and immediacy of what was facing us, and largely carried on with my life. So yes, I acknowledge that I broke the law, but we desperately need urgent governmental action around the world to avert disaster, and I hope you will accept that I was true to my own morals in trying to play a small part in making that happen.""

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/01/28/newsletter-35/,"Disruption in Brussels, disappointment in Davos. Spain declares a climate crisis, but where is the action? Another issue bursting with announcements and news from XR activity around the world. School Strike Week 75, Davos Dear Rebels, We'd love to report that the new decade has brought a wave of sweeping change to the world's policymakers. Sadly, this is not the case. Instead, it's still business as usual for our supposed leaders and those who spread their message. This week's issue is particularly rife with reports of the media and its tendency towards misrepresentation. The act and art of telling the truth has never seemed so vital or so distant. In Davos, we saw the cropping out of African activist Vanessa Nakate from her place in a photo alongside some of the planet's youngest and bravest campaigners. XR Spain Elsewhere, the Spanish government has tentatively announced a Climate Emergency. While this is progress of a sort, we respond by saying: Good, but not good enough. Words and gestures are useless without significant action to underpin the statement. On the topic of actions matching words, this week's History Corner tells the extraordinary story of the environmental victory every forgot: a welcome reminder that change is possible! In other news, we celebrate the bravery and creativity of XR Belgium, who carried out a powerful action at a car show involving over 180 arrests. What a way to start the new year! Meanwhile, rebels in Norway have seen some success in campaigning against one of the leading media conglomerates of the country, demanding truth and justice for the planet. XR Belgium Finally, in line with our efforts to reach rebels in all parts of the world, we are pleased to announce that the International Newsletter is now being translated into over six languages!

Support the Rebellion Action Highlights 18 JAN | Brussels, Belgium Extinction Rebellion Belgium organised a powerful and striking mass-action of civil disobedience on the busiest day of the Brussels Autosalon. About 250 rebels participated, with 185 arrests. Its purpose: 'to correct the deceitful image the car industry portrays of itself … [to denounce] the many lies which car manufacturers keep selling to the public, to increase their sales at the cost of the environment, people’s health and social justice.' Die-ins were staged, vehicles smeared with fake blood and rebels chained themselves to steering wheels. The Shell stand was a main focus. Rebels held a 'Shell Kills' placard, wore masks made from the company logo and handed out leaflets highlighting the auto industry greenwash e.g. – The use of environmentalist rhetoric while simultaneously producing and selling huge numbers of heavily polluting vehicles. At the entrance and exit to the show, dozens of rebels, many of whom were teenagers, staged a mass die-in. An XR banner was unfurled, and in the car park, fake parking tickets placed on windows of vehicles. The XR actions were described as 'anecdotiques' (trivial) by FEBIAC, the organisers of the show, yet they previously applied for a judgement to prohibit and/or place heavy fines on civil disobedience during the motor show, claiming it would suffer irreparable damage. XR lawyers are presently analysing the order. It is/was never the intention of XR to cause damage, nor to block the fair or target visitors, but to raise awareness and call for a new model of transport which respects the ecological and social good. 21 - 24 JAN | Davos, Switzerland Photo by XR Switzerland. Rebels, Climate Strikers, and other environmental activists converged on a remote ski resort in Switzerland last week to speak truth to the most powerful people on the planet. The annual World Economic Forum in Davos attracts presidents, princes and business billionaires. Traditionally, they have ignored environmental concerns to champion unfettered economic growth before flying home on private jets. But this year's conference showed a new direction. Finally there was a focus on the climate emergency, with sessions on sustainability, cutting emissions, and the financial instability the global crisis will bring. Determined rebels reached the ski resort after braving the cold on a three-day hike across the Swiss Alps. Their message to the delegates was simple. Business as usual is no longer acceptable. 100 companies are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions since 1988. They all attended the World Economic Forum. But after four days, it was clear they weren't prepared to make any real change. While some attendees talked the talk when it came to the ecological and climate emergency, the deadlines for action remained the insanely distant 2050, and no major concessions were made to cut current emissions. A rebel who attended the conference told reporters, “If you're in an emergency, you don't let it get worse for thirty years before tackling it… We need to be carbon zero by 2025.” For the second year running, Climate Strike activist Greta Thunberg made a key speech at the four day conference, batted away insults from those who should know better and ultimately left the event feeling frustrated. Photo by XR Switzerland. 24 JAN | Davos, Switzerland & Uganda At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Ugandan Vanessa Nakate was cropped out of a headlining Associated Press image featuring a group of prominent climate activists. She was in Davos to bring global attention to the climate-related struggles of the African people and to the plight of the Congo Rainforest, the second largest rainforest in the world. ”Africa is the least emitter of carbons, but we are the most affected by the climate crisis. You erasing our voices won't change anything,” she said in her compelling video response to having her presence removed from the image. Nakate has been protesting in front of the Ugandan Parliament every week since January, 2019, demanding the country's leadership declare a climate emergency. She has persevered, despite the wariness of parliamentary security. “In Uganda, people who protest in large groups are at risk of being arrested,” she said. In her efforts, she highlights the injustice of climate change. Many Ugandans depend heavily on agriculture for their livelihood. Alternating floods and droughts devastate crops and raise food prices. The most privileged, the biggest carbon emitters, can weather the fluctuations. Whereas, she says, “Literally, in my country, a lack of rain means starvation and death for the less privileged.” Starting in October, 2019, Nakate has been striking daily for the Congo Rainforest. Since 2001, about 6% of the rainforest has been lost – an area roughly the size of England. The main agents: industrial logging, mining, urban expansion, and large-scale agriculture. The charcoal trade cuts into the rainforest as well. Most of the region's poor rely on charcoal for cooking, reminding us of the importance of an equitable transition to ecological justice. The movement Nakate started with her lone protests has gained momentum. She has since founded Youth for Future Africa and the Rise Up Movement. Globally, people have joined her campaign to Save the Congo Rainforest. Follow Vanessa Nakate on Twitter and Instagram. XR Uganda is also in open rebellion against the current climate crisis. After months of extraordinary rainfall, many people lost their lives and their homes to heavy flooding in the Bundibugyo district. XR Uganda mourns in solidarity with Bundibugyo. They are campaigning to raise money for the victims and their families. 21 JAN | Spain The Spanish government has declared a climate emergency, taking the country's first small steps towards action on climate change. The left-wing coalition says it will bring forward legislation within its first 100 days in office that will work towards transitioning the country to renewable energy. Environment Minister Teresa Ribera said Spain was inspired by actions in France and will follow suit by creating a public advisory panel. The climate emergency declaration came on January 21, as powerful storm Gloria battered much of eastern Spain, killing at least 13 people, flooding miles of crop fields and prompting the government to call an emergency meeting to deal with the impact of the storm. Collapsed bridges, damaged railway lines and entire beaches were wiped away, with hundreds of dead fish being washed ashore and a waist-deep carpet of seafoam engulfing entire streets. Scientists warn climate targets must be reached or southern Spain could be reduced to a desert by the end of the century. Extinction Rebellion Spain responded by saying: 'Good, but lacking ambition. We continue.' Rebels are focusing on the enactment of an effective citizen's assembly: 'A citizen's assembly shows that people can act directly in public decision-making at the national level and that the institutional design taken by the Spanish government guarantees that participation. We will work to ensure the effectiveness of this Citizen Assembly.' Spain now joins the European Union and nine other countries worldwide in declaring a climate emergency. So far, national climate emergency declarations have been made by Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Canada, France, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. In 2019, the final year of the hottest decade on record, climate emergency declarations sounded the alarm, with thousands of cities around the world declaring an emergency. About 800 million people around the world now live in places that have declared a climate emergency – that's one in ten people on the planet. 12 JAN | Norway In Norway, the average temperature for January has been more than 7 degrees above normal. There is no snow, and a group of rebel skiers made this very clear, as they slogged along on asphalt outside the NRK: Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. Norway has become rich as a major exporter of oil (exporting one third of European oil) and gas (third largest gas exporter in the world) as well as being one of the largest producers of fertiliser. The government aims to keep producing until at least 2070, with several ministers for oil having declared that “we'll take up all the oil and gas we find”. Whilst seen as a “green” country, Norway is the seventh largest GHG emitter in the world if you include the “exported” emissions. Rebels have also targeted one of the nation's largest media conglomerates, the Schibsted group, who own newspapers, online news sites and other media, and are supportive of Norway's oil and gas industry. This support includes the promotion of regular advertorials favouring major fossil fuel exporter Equinor, which is active in 26 countries. Rebels under the redesigned logos at the offices of Schibsted. Stein from XR Norway commented: We demanded that the work for Equinor should cease and that environmental groups should be given space to counter the propaganda. (…) The action got a lot of attention and, by Friday, the Schibsted group declared that the Equinor campaign had reached its end and that future advertorials would be easier to distinguish from the editorial content of the papers!” This is a major success in challenging the media practice of spreading positive messages about the fossil fuel industry and promoting climate change denying opinions.

Imagine this: there's a terrifying environmental threat caused by chemical emissions that could destroy all life on earth. The companies producing the emissions put out all the disinformation they can to keep their businesses going. However, the governments of the world unite to remove those chemicals from production, and the world, miraculously, heals. This isn't a fairytale about climate change. This is the real story of a grave environmental threat that was at the top of everyone's mind in the 1980s, but has been largely forgotten by the public today. Here's the story about how the people won a victory and protected our planet from the holes in the ozone layer. Read in full here. This piece was brought to you by the Rebel Writers.

Tens of Millions form human chain in India's Bihar state First 'Heading for Extinction' talk given in China 'A year inside XR': Reflections from a rebel in XR UK 'We were on the streets for two weeks in October to speak to Government, but now we're here to speak to corporations and industries, especially firms like BlackRock who have a massive impact through their investments. As we move into climate and ecological collapse, companies like BlackRock keep financing companies like JBS and Cargill – both among the world's largest meat producers – pouring money into them when they're fully aware that these companies are responsible for the majority of Amazon deforestation. Animal Rebellion is a sister movement to XR, we share the same values and principles and we share the same goals. We ask Government to tell the truth, but we also ask that they tell the truth about the livestock industries' contribution to climate change. We believe that the second demand of XR cannot be achieved without putting an end to the intensive livestock and fishing industries. Since I joined XR and Animal Rebellion, I've found a place of acceptance as well as an overwhelming sense of power to change things. I've also extended my compassion to humanity and opened my eyes to the rest of the world rather than just my immediate surroundings. Now I feel that I can sense the interconnectedness of people and animals and other natural systems.' Dora, Software Engineer.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2020/01/17/newsletter-34/,"Australia Indonesia Dear Rebels, Welcome to our first International Newsletter of the year. As a new decade dawns, we are faced with a world already on the brink of disaster. However, amid the grief and flames there are so many of us fighting hard to make this decade the one that finally brings change to a society - and ecology - that needs it more than ever. Australia and Indonesia have been facing floods and fires of unprecedented scale. In Indonesia, the tragedy is deepened by a lack of awareness, both within the country and beyond it. The crisis is largely being ignored by global news-organisations, and many Indonesians fail to see the connection between the ecological emergency and the current global system. In Australia, the tragedy and loss of life is intensified by the uniqueness of the habitat which is being stripped away. Below you can read about some of the acts of solidarity from other members of the global community who are united in grief and determined to see tangible change before any more of the world's flora and fauna is lost forever. In other, brighter news, we highlight the landmark victory in The Netherlands, where the Dutch Supreme Court has ruled that the government must act immediately to protect its citizens from the deadly effects of the climate crisis. While this success within the legal system is the first of its kind, it will hopefully not be the last, as other governments and courts wake up to the scale of the problem. Also included today is an update on the protests in Russia, where three brave activists are continuing their campaign despite persecution and imprisonment. We salute their intense determination and strength. Finally, an opportunity for European rebels to get involved with an exciting new project: the Tour de Rebel, which seeks to educate and raise awareness in a sustainable and adventurous way.

Support the Rebellion 31 DEC onwards - Jakarta, Indonesia Torrential rains have led to landslides and severe flooding in Indonesia, with the destruction centred in and around the capital, Jakarta. Dozens of people have been killed and tens of thousands have had to abandon their homes. The storms began on New Year's Eve, when 72,000 Olympic-size swimming pools worth of rainwater poured onto the city, the heaviest downpour since records began in the 19th century. Although floodwaters are now diminishing, more heavy rainfall is expected in the coming weeks. Members of XR Jakarta have been directly affected by the crisis. Many have friends and family living in the temporary refugee camps that now house the dispossessed. Others have volunteered to help in the aftermath. A group of doctor rebels are busy doing medical checkups on those in the camps. When the situation settles down, XR Jakarta will be launching direct actions and organising a series of talks where experts can explicitly link the climate crisis to the floods. The majority of Indonesians don't see a connection. One in five don't believe in climate change at all. The current disaster has been exacerbated by a government unwilling to both face the scale of the climate crisis, and address the severe wealth inequality within Indonesian society. Jakarta is home to ten million people, but it won't be for much longer. The megacity is sinking, and so quickly that entire regions will be permanently submerged within a decade. This is partly because of rising sea levels from global overheating and partly because of a lack of public infrastructure. Piped water is only available to a small elite, so most people drink and bathe in water pumped from aquifers deep under the city. As the groundwater disappears, the land above rapidly subsides. On top of this, extractive industries in Indonesia are given free rein. Environmental safeguards are not enforced, and the government is wedded to coal-generated electricity for the next decade. Consequently, Jakarta suffers terrible air pollution, and its rivers are clogged with around 20 tons of trash per day. The city also boasts the biggest uncovered landfill in Southeast Asia. During October Rebellion, dozens of members of XR Jakarta marched through the city centre, demanding the government call a climate emergency and totally reform its environmental policy. They were ignored - with one official stating “we are in a climate crisis when we reach dreadful and unlivable conditions.” The government's solution to the recent flooding has been to use weather modification technology. Its air force has been seeding clouds with salt to stop them unleashing more rain. As for the long-term problem of Jakarta sinking, the government recently announced that it will be moving the capital city to the island of Borneo, hundreds of miles away, by 2023. Reluctant to acknowledge the climate crisis, the official reason for the move is overcrowding. And despite Indonesia having a wealth of coastal mangroves to absorb carbon and stem the flooding, the government is allowing them to be razed for palm oil production. 10 - 16 JAN | Multiple #BushfireRebellion in London Our world is on fire. The Australian heartland burns like never before. According to the Annual Climate Statement 2019 – from the Australia Bureau of Meteorology, this has been the hottest year on record. With temperatures roughly 1.52 °C above average and rainfall down as much as %40, this is 11.7% below previous driest year. High winds have exacerbated the progress of the inferno. This, undeniably, is the climate crisis in action. 28 people have died, including one from the effects of air pollution caused by the smoke. Thousands of homes and hundreds of thousands of hectares have been burned to the ground. To some, the biggest catastrophe is the loss of flora and fauna, with an estimated one billion animals dead, many of which are on the extinction list. 10th of Jan. Sydney The tragedy and severity of these fires can hardly be put into words. In Sydney, tens of thousands marched through the streets demanding change to Australia's climate policy. Across the world, rebels have come together to share their sadness and show solidarity with acts of protest and performance. Over 30 countries have now signed up to the #BushfireRebellion, with dozens of actions taking place on the 10th of Jan, and a massive turnout in London to demonstrate outside the Australia High Commission. The next round of protest is due on the 16th of Jan. Find your local group and join us in fighting fire with love and rage. XR Argentina #BushfireRebellion 20 DEC | The Hague, The Netherlands On December 20th the Dutch Supreme Court chose to uphold two lower court rulings legally obliging the Dutch government to take action to protect its citizens from climate change. The ruling will reverberate around the world as the case - the first of its kind - has since inspired others, some of which are still progressing through their countries' legal systems, including one in the US. The Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch climate solutions NGO, gathered 886 ordinary Dutch citizen co-plaintiffs and issued their first summons in 2013. In 2015 a district court ruled that the Dutch government was obliged under civil law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 and 40% by 2020, due to numerous documents it had signed to that effect at international meetings. The government appealed, but in 2018 the appeals court not only upheld the decision, it ruled the government is also obliged under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), to protect its citizens from harm due to dangerous climate change. The government appealed again, taking the case to the Supreme Court of the Netherlands in The Hague. This latest ruling is the end of the road and means the Dutch government must reduce emissions by at least 25% compared with 1990 levels, by the end of 2020. The win is hugely significant, as it signals the legal arguments used are sound, and 47 states are bound by the ECHR. The Dutch government did little to try to meet the 2020 target until the 2018 appeals ruling. It has since begun closing one of the country's five coal power plants and launched new subsidies for renewables and energy-saving measures. Emissions have so far only fallen 15% from 1990 levels, leaving a big gap, but Urgenda has published a plan, in collaboration with over 700 other organizations, setting out 50 measures the government can take to meet its legal obligations to protect its citizens from the climate crisis. These cases, and others against corporations and investors, “are creating a burgeoning toolkit of environmental jurisprudence,” said Urgenda co-founder, Marjan Minnesma, writing in Nature last month. “Together, these serve notice on contributors to the world's still-growing emissions that their inaction is no longer defensible.” 20 DEC - 11 JAN | Moscow, Russia Arshak, outside the Australian Embassy, Moscow, 11th January Back in November 2019, we reported on Russia Fridays For Future (FFF) activist Arshak Makichyan. The 25-year old violinist was facing jail time for organizing an unauthorised three-person strike in Moscow on 25thOctober 2019. Despite an international surge of support for the activist and numerous solidarity actions, on 20th December Arshak was sentenced to six days in prison – “a disproportionately severe punishment and one of the harshest crackdowns on student campaigners anywhere in the world.” For 350.org's managing director in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, this punishment was nothing less than a deliberate act of intimidation towards all climate activists across the world. Now released, Arshak admits he is feeling quite vulnerable after his time in jail but is grateful for the outpouring of support. He comments “Some activists may feel discouraged...but we are in a climate emergency and we don't have time to be discouraged…Personally, I don't know what will happen next, but I know that I'm going to continue striking every week.” The two other activists arrested alongside Arshak on 25th October, Konstantin Fokin and Liubov Samylova, concur: while they have yet to be sentenced, they are already back on the streets, protesting. Seasoned activist and XR supporter Konstantin comments: “If you know your rights and, even more importantly, you know why you are doing what you are doing – then you just live with that, it becomes part of the process.” Konstantin in solo XR protest, Moscow, 26th December Konstantin was arrested once again on 26th December for an XR protest which also sought to remind the government of Article 31 of the Russian constitution: “Citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to gather peacefully, without weapons, and to hold meetings, rallies, demonstrations, marches and pickets.” The third arrestee for the protest on 25th October, FFF activist Liubov, described the experience of arrest as ‘strange' and ‘awkward', particularly for a 15-minute action. She too appears undeterred however, and on 5th January, was once again holding a solo picket. Liubov in solo FFF protest, Moscow, 5th January The three activists emphasise that international support and solidarity are important to them and the many other activists in Russia; as is action in rebels' own countries. Crucially, as Arshak finally reminds us, action is needed from everyone: “Please don't look for heroes” he says, “we need everyone to act, a few people cannot save the future.” To support Russian climate activists join the #Let Russia Strike for Climate campaign on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook.

So it was really refreshing to realize there were loads of families and kids around and maybe she is going to be safe. I've got a bit braver every time, and now she's involved in all kinds of actions with me; there's always someone there who will take Isla and keep her safe, or will allow me passage to get out - I've found that people have almost created a family. Isla seems to be this little ball of energy who goes around and injects regen into everybody. I think it's actually one of the best things I've done for her, and it's been really fundamental to her development. There are things that I've witnessed in my life that my daughter is never going to see or understand. One day I'm going to have to turn around to her and say ‘there used to be an Amazon rainforest', ‘there used to be all these kinds of animals', and it's terrifying. I'm angry because no one is doing anything. It just seems like everyone is saying ‘yes there is a massive problem' but people have too much money invested in things that are destroying the planet.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/12/18/newsletter-33/,"-Dearest rebels, welcome to the last XR Newsletter of the year - and indeed, the decade. We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you do. Whether you are a donor, volunteer, brave arrestable or quiet supporter, rest assured you are vital to the movement and XR would not exist without you. Thank you. Today we bring you another mega-issue, bursting with stories from all around the world. Firstly, the results (or lack of them) during the COP in Madrid are proof enough that our leaders have abandoned their people. As you can read below, the whole event was characterized by a lack of decisiveness or positive action. Ultimately, chaos was the only obvious outcome of the Conference of the Parties. After four weeks of exceptional endurance, courage and empathy on the part of the rebels, the Global Hunger Strike is now winding down, but it’s seen huge support from the worldwide community. As has an international wave of Civil-Discobedience, which seems to have struck a chord with rebels and the public alike, bringing people out onto the streets to celebrate life and hope through music and dance. Other stories covered in this issue include: a Cube of Truth from XR Greece, a pipeline protest from XR Israel, the terrible mistreatment of French rebels in Lyon, and an inspiring action from XR Sri Lanka, who are replanting the rainforest! Also, don’t miss this issue’s History Corner - discussing the rise of the Peaceful Revolution, the fall of the Berlin wall, and the part that an environmental newsletter played in changing history. Finally, as we collectively draw a line under 2019, we invite you all to reflect on where we are as a species and as a people. The world is entering a new age of urgency. The next five to ten years will be a time of unparalleled global change, and we will certainly be tested, both as individuals and as a society. Rest assured, dear rebels, we will be sharing this journey together, as we move, inexorably and peacefully, toward a new global paradigm.

Support the Rebellion Contents Action Highlights XR Unchained History Corner XR Content 2nd - 15th DEC | Madrid, Spain “We are coming together to bear witness to the disaster of COP25” There is a deep sense of sadness, disappointment and anger at the complete lack of tangible progress made by world leaders during the Conference of the Parties in Madrid. With an estimated 500,000 people taking to the streets, XR has been busy campaigning alongside Greta Thunberg, Fridays for Future, world scientists, indigeneous & grassroots climate leaders and many, many thousands more. We have seen some outstanding actions, with rebels working incredibly hard to be noticed and heard: from the celebratory Discobedience to the sombre Marcha de los Mares Muertos, and even a pile of horse manure to acknowledge the end of the conference. There is a sense that rich countries, who are principally responsible for the climate emergency have spent the talks dialing back ambition and blocking progress. Following the US pulling out of the Paris Agreement, they have been actively undermining the process. “This is the worst I have seen in the last 10 years of me attending negotiations,” said Harjeet Singh, climate change specialist at Action Aid from New Delhi, India. “It can’t get worse than that. It’s arm-twisting and bullying at the highest level.” In general, there is very strong and clear criticism from civil society about the way in which the talks have been conducted. The market-based suggestions brought forward are making things worse for people who are not responsible for this emergency situation. “As we sit here, 45 million people in Africa are facing the wrath of climate change. And that is the reality [...] Now, this system, the United Nations system on climate change, is broken. It has not been able to help these people.” 18th NOV - 14th DEC | Worldwide Hunger strikers Julian, Marko and Peter, London, UK On the 18th November, over 500 rebels in 28 countries joined in a Global Hunger Strike that highlighted the vulnerability of our food systems, and express solidarity with those already starving because of climate and ecological breakdown. At the end of last week, now risking their long-term health, three hunger strikers in the UK and one in Australia continued their protest. The four rebels chose to stage their hunger strikes on the very doorstep of power: political party headquarters in the UK, Victoria State Parliament in Australia. Rebels supporting the hunger strikers as well as high-profile visitors expressed how deeply moved they were by the strikes, describing the support and sense of community as “humbling and beautiful”. However, political response to the strikes in the UK and Australia, has been sadly lukewarm. Though a small number of politicians came forward and engaged with the rebels on hunger strike, a large number, including political leaders, stayed away. On the night of the UK General Election, the striking rebels camped outside the re-elected PM’s party headquarters in freezing conditions. Disappointingly, the PM never once made eye contact with them. Similarly, in Australia, hunger striker Dave was dismayed that after 28 days of visible presence – with flags and posters drawing attention to his frequently solitary hunger strike – only nine members of the State Parliament had come to meet him. He commented, “I felt it was the absolute minimum ... and I am surprised at just how hard it has been.” Hunger striker Dave, Melbourne, Australia But the small number of politicians engaging with the hunger strikers does not mean it has been without impact. UK hunger striker Petra recalled how profound conversations took place on the pavement with members of the public, and also during hospital visits, with medical personnel attending to the hunger strikers. At a broader level, she feels the hunger strike has foregrounded a crucial dimension of the movement – but one that sometimes gets lost in the heat of the action and the whirlwind of rebellious energy: that is XR’s emphasis on connection, on looking out for each other, and on gratitude. The hunger strikes are now winding down: in the UK, hunger strikers ended their strike on Friday 13th and joined in a celebratory communal meal on Saturday 14th, four weeks after the launch of the Global Strike. In Australia, though increasingly weak, Dave bravely intends to continue refusing food until he has heard from 12 members of the State Parliament or until Christmas day. Until that time, if you are in Melbourne, do drop by; alternatively, should you wish, you can send Dave messages of support by clicking here. 29th NOV | Lyon, France This horrifying video shows French police brutalising Lyon rebels at a November 29 action to protest at Amazon’s new distribution hub east of the city of Lyon. The giant new warehouse will be 359 metres long and have the area of 22 football pitches. XR Lyon said: “The disproportionate violence to remove our protesters was the unfortunate proof that we had chosen the right target. Upset the current economic system, which kills us little by little, and the State will make you pay dearly, asphyxiating you, dragging you through the mud, beating you. But they should know, they should listen: we will not give up. We are as determined as ever.” Worldwide XR Moreland showing off their moves in Australia ‘If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution.’ Last spring, rebels from down under brought us the grooviest way to be rebellious. Their funky tunes and smooth moves are now catching on across the world. As rebels in 23 cities, including in Bali, Paris, Amsterdam, Sydney and New York put their dancing shoes on and turned normal city roads into our dancefloors. At the COP in Madrid, hundreds blocked off the central shopping street Gran Via, ready for a dance off with world leaders challenging them to take urgent action on the climate and ecological crisis because we all want to be ... stayin’ alive, stayin’ alive. Meanwhile, Christmas shoppers in Newcastle were surprised to meet a friendly dancing polar bear and many wigs. If you need some extra exercise to work off all those festive sprouts, shake your hips and practice your moves here. 8th Dec | Athens, Greece XR Hellas and XR Hellas Youth organised a Cube of Truth, to inform people about the climate crisis and the alternatives we can adopt in our daily lives. They describe a Cube of Truth as “a peaceful street activism action that aims to educate and inform the public about a specific topic through the use of video and dialogue.” One team “forms the circle, displaying a device that plays graphic and powerful footage of environmental destruction. The activists who make up the circle remain silent, statuesque and blindfolded in a compelling and eye-catching static art piece.” Meanwhile the outreach team engages with the public by asking interested onlookers questions about the footage they are looking at.” 1st DEC | Israel Members of XR Israel took part in a blockade of the Maccabiah Energy and Business Conference to protest the EastMed gas pipeline, which is intended to be established between Israel, Cyprus, Greece and Italy for gas transmission and export to Europe. Rebels said: “Building more infrastructure for fossil fuels, which is exacerbating the climate crisis while undermining the marine environment, is a crime against the world (...) While those who are expected to benefit from this are primarily gas companies, those who will suffer from the many damages and ecological dangers are citizens of Israel and our partner countries. Those in charge must understand that we know what they are planning, and that our lives are worth more than their profits.” 23rd - 24th NOV | Rakwana, Sri Lanka XR Sri Lanka successfully launched the first phase of its Reforest Rebellion in partnership with the Rainforest Protectors of Sri Lanka. Approximately 300 saplings of pioneer species (native/endemic) were successfully planted. The site is in Rakwana, in the buffer zone of the Sinharaja Rainforest, where attempted tea planting during the colonial period left the land degraded. 14 volunteers (the youngest being 3 yrs old) braved the torrential rain, the leeches, the sunburn and the inaccessibility to a modern toilet to get the job done. A major part of this project was the involvement of the local estate workers and laborers. The Rainforest Protectors have been building a relationship with them for the past years, and this is vital to ensuring the plants are kept alive. The locals saw and endured the intense physical strain it took to plant these trees, and they make revenue through this project so as to look after the saplings and prevent forest fires being lit. Phase 2 of our Reforest Rebellion will take place in December, where they plan to conduct a community awareness programme amongst the villages near the Sinharaja Rainforest Reserve. Resident children will also be invited to participate in reforestation activities. For more information, please support them on facebook.

Claire, at the COP in Madrid ‘I lived in Myanmar for four years and I saw a lot of devastating impacts with regards to climate change over there, especially drought and increased incidences of floods and cyclones. I came back to Tasmania and was really adamant that I wanted to do activism because I thought that it’s my responsibility as a citizen. I saw that extinction rebellion was tweeted by George Monbiot and I’ve always really admired his writing and thought that if he likes it, then it’s going to be a cool activist group. In Tasmania, the increased ocean temperatures mean that we are losing a lot of our shellfish and fishing industries. Also, invasive species are taking over, so something like twenty million sea urchins have creeped in to the coasts and are wiping out local marine species. There are now also increased incidents of bushfires. There are really bad ones in the Gondwanan world heritage rainforest: Eucalyptus burns and regenerates, but this Gondwanan vegetation is ancient. When it burns it never returns. I just want people to think about other countries and other people living in those countries as humans just like their family members. Same with the species: we are all connected and all rely on one another so just have some empathy and think of them when making decisions and using industries that may make decisions that are not sustainable for our future.’ We are receiving amazing human stories and we want to know yours.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/11/21/columbia-defenders/,"Telling Each Other the Truth: Why Are Defenders of Life and Earth Being Murdered in Colombia? Carlos Aldairo Arenas Salinas, Colombian farmer and environmentalist, murdered for protecting Colombia’s paramos (highlands) and endangered native species such as the Condor. Colombia was 2018’s most deadly country for earth defenders. Over 170 social and environmental leaders have been murdered in 2019 so far and 136 indigenous people have been murdered under Ivan Duque’s current administration. The second most biodiverse country in the world, Colombia’s ecosystems are being violated by multinational extractivist and food industries. 21st November 2019: National strike in Colombia to demand change and protection for Madre Tierra 21st November, 2019 - Bogotá (COLOMBIA) - Carlos Aldairo Arena Salinas is the latest environmental defender to fall in Colombia’s attack on life. The 44-year-old environmentalist was shot to death on a farm in the central Andean region of Tolima in Colombia. As a local farmer, he had branched out and promoted the Route of the Condor, an ecotourism project which gave people the rare opportunity to catch a glimpse of the famed endangered Andean Condor, the country’s national bird. Arenas Salinas gave his life to save the Condor from extinction by sharing its majesty with those who cared. As the sixth mass extinction advances, so the few brave souls who resist are cut down by a system so toxic it ultimately will kill everything in its path. Fellow activist Katherine Ariza tweets of ""Eyebrows"", as Arenas Salinas was known as "" a defender of water, the valley of the Frailejones and all of the highland’s (paramo) creatures. He had so much love for the highlands, he fought for their preservation until the end. Last night, no doubt doing something that would risk his life one last time, he is said to have been slain by criminal gang in the Totarito sector.” Colombia weeps, and the world grieves. For the third consecutive year, Colombia was among the three most dangerous countries for the life of environmental defenders. In its report, British NGO Global Witness, states that “in 2018 an average of more than three activists per week were killed, defending their lands from the invasion of industries such as mining, logging and agribusiness. The actual figure is likely to be much higher because cases are often not recorded and rarely investigated. It is difficult to find reliable and verifiable evidence.” La Guajira’s Cerrejón coal mine: human and ecological tragedy The devastation in the Guajira region of Colombia that BHP Billiton, Glencore and Anglo-American have left is just one of many example of multinational corporate humanitarian and environmental crimes in the country. According to the local Wayuu people, the Cerrejón, one of the largest coal mines in the world, has contributed to contamination of local rivers, local corruption, and drought in the region. Jakeline Romero Epiayu, an activist with Force of Wayuu Women, believes that the mine is harming people’s health, as well as local land and water resources. On a recent press tour, she said that mining is condemning La Guajira residents to poverty and death. Stories of those who are openly challenging this toxic system Extinction Rebellion stands in solidarity with communities of resistance in Colombia who are fighting against a global economic system based on exploitation of natural resources and destruction of basic human rights. In the region of Cauca, the Nasa indigenous community have been fighting to protect their ancestral territory from narcotrafficking and mono-crop sugar cane plantations. The pillars of their political formation are autonomy, cultural identity, unity and territory. “Our mother, the mother of all living beings, is subjected to owners, it’s private property. By subjecting her to property in to exploit her, they took away her freedom to conceive life and to protect and teach us,” say Mother Earth’s freedom fighters, the Nasa: Empathy begins at home. Many of those reading this will, in the past days and months, have fought, grafted and struggled to build spaces where human beings can come together, support one another in a shared sense of loving grief. Grief for the damage we see all around us; grief for the future we fear for our children or ourselves. For many, it’s only by means of this hard-won togetherness that our eyes can be opened to another harsh truth: that the emergency is not a future prospect, but rather a fact of life for countless people and communities around the world, and has been for decades. Empathy begins at home – but it doesn’t end there. It takes us beyond borders, beyond divisions, to a greater understanding of the immensity of what’s at stake. It’s only with a global, collective moment of awakening that we can hope to face this crisis. On the 21st of November, when millions of Colombians will take to the streets to demand better conditions for their lives and environment, we invite you to act in solidarity by sharing this information. #ParoNacional21Nov #GenocidioIndígena #DefensoresDeLaMadreTierra share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/11/21/hunger-strike-day-3/,"Officials Cede to Hunger Strikers’ Demands as Extinction Rebellion Enters Day 3 of the Biggest Climate Hunger Strike in History Earth, November 20 - Hundreds of XR rebels in 27 countries on six continents continued their hunger strike for a third day today to demand governments take immediate action to end the climate and ecological emergency that threatens the collapse of civilization.. More than 400 people with Extinction Rebellion have been on a Global Hunger Strike since November 18th to demand governments enact the group’s three demands. Many are also demanding that officials meet with them to discuss the planetary crisis on camera. They plan to continue fasting for at least a week, while several rebels have already pledged to go longer. The hunger strike is working. Sweden’s environment minister has agreed to meet with Swedish hunger strikers. In the UK, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats have talked with hunger strikers on camera, with commitment to arrange follow up one hour meeting as requested by strikers. Another political party, Plaid Cymru, also agreed to an on-camera meeting. In the Netherlands on Wednesday (Nov 20) hunger strikers sat down with officials from the municipality of Wageningen for a recorded meeting to push for tougher action on the climate and ecological crisis. “Rebels are desperate, hungry, and tired because they don’t want their families, kids, and future to die. Every moment the climate apocalypse grows nearer. We need to do everything in our power to stop it, before it’s too late,” said one of the organisers, Giovanni Tamacas, 20, from San Francisco, California, United State. Rebels are hunger striking in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ghana, Holland, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States. They stand in solidarity with the 820 million people the World Health Organisation says suffer from extreme hunger. This number will rise as the climate and ecological emergency intensifies, devastating global food supplies. Six hunger strikers from XR Barcelona have stationed themselves at Palau de la Generalitat, the headquarters of the regional government. In the United States, hunger strikers with XR Washington DC occupied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office to demand that she stops blocking passage of the climate emergency resolution. Students at Columbia University in New York are demanding the university divests from fossil fuels. Time has almost run out to address the ecological crisis, which includes the 6th mass species extinction, global pollution, and abrupt, runaway climate change. Scientists and other experts see societal collapse and mass death as inevitable, with human extinction a possibility, unless rapid action is taken. Extinction Rebellion believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel, using peaceful civil disobedience, when faced with criminal inactivity by their Government. Extinction Rebellion’s key demands are: Government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change. Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.

Facebook event here. Activists will dump a pile of wood ashes (waste collected from pizza ovens and woodburning stoves) in front of BlackRock’s entrance doors. They will then put on a carnival of flames and ashes with chaotic dance performances, fire-jugglers, musicians, speakers from multiple groups, giving a personal account of the fate their communities and territories face when daily attacked by extrativist industries. This action intends to bring the heat and destruction of the Amazon rainforest fires to the doorstep of BlackRock, which comfortably sits profiting from the damage its investments create around the world. BirthStrike founder and Mesadorm singer Blythe Pepino, also active as part of the #XRSnowflakes affinity group, said: ""I'm protesting outside BlackRock because we must keep holding to account the behemoths that are funding and therefore accountable for the destruction and violence of Indigenous lands and people. I'm sending a clear message that we can see this happening in England, and it must stop both for social justice and environmental justice. Not enough of the general public know the power BlackRock has and a big part of the day is drawing attention to that power as well as demanding they change course. I represent the BirthStrike movement, for whom child bearing has become an unbearable idea due to companies like this that have consistently funded our progress towards destruction and undermined the environmental movement towards sustainability. Corporations like these can bear the brunt of our grief and anger - had they acted responsibly and not in greed many years ago, the world could be in a much better position now, and we could be planning to have families of our own."" Supporters and speakers are expected from groups such as Amazon Watch, Stop Ecocide, Parents for Future, and Animal Rebellion. The protest stands in solidarity with APIB (Brazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association) as their delegation visits London as part of their European advocacy tour “Indigenous Blood: Not a Single Drop more”, aiming to draw awareness to the serious violence native people face in Brazil for defending their land and rights. Through this tour APIB also seeks to inform European governments, trade organisations, and the public opinion about the real source of the Brazilian products consumed in Europe, many times the fruit of human rights violations and conflict areas. APIB is asking an end to European complicity in the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest and the persecution of its native people, for commodities grown on and extracted from their lands. The delegation continue the tour despite mourning the recent murder of Indigenous 'Forest Guardian' Paulo Paulino Guajajara, shot in the face on November 1st by illegal loggers. Fellow Forest Guardian Laercio Guajajara was also hospitalised with gunshot wounds during the ambush. Yesterday, they awarded President Jair Bolsonaro a ""Racist of the Year"" award during a protest at the Brazilian Embassy in London yesterday in collaboration with Survival International.) “Companies like BlackRock fund and profit from the businesses exploiting Amazonia. We won’t stand by as Indigenous genocide and the decimation of wildlife continue in the name of ‘business as usual’,” said wildlife biologist James Fox, 25, from London, adding: “Indigenous communities are scientifically proven to be the best stewards of the natural world, and have been on the global front lines of climate and ecological destruction for generations. The climate movement must support the struggle for Indigenous rights – and BlackRock must divest from this destruction.” Who are BlackRock? Until the financial crisis BlackRock was unknown, but after its name was everywhere in the investment world. Nowadays this discreet investment firm surfaces in investigative reports as a lead investor in the crisis of deforestation and land conflict. Its investments in deforestation-risk companies have been increasing since 2014, from a total of $1 billion USD to $1.6 billion USD in 2018, making them top investors in deforestation from Brazilian forests to Indonesia or Borneo. BlackRock is a major shareholder in some of the largest agribusiness companies responsible for widespread deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado, including soy traders Bunge and ADM, and meat producers JBS, Marfrig and Minerva.​​​​​​​ Bunge for instances, was among a group of agricultural traders fined by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) for purchasing 3,000 tons of soy and other grains from farms embargoed for deforestation. After far-right candidate, Bolsonaro, won the Brazilian elections, BlackRock announced expansion of operations in Brazil. BlackRock is one of the top three shareholders in 25 of the world’s largest publicly listed “deforestation-risk” companies (94%) through its index funds, potentially increasing further its risks. BlackRock holds shares in 61 of the 167 companies active in producing and trading soy, beef, palm oil, pulp and paper, rubber and timber.​​​​​​ Its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) labeled funds contain numerous high-risk holdings linked to recent deforestation, land rights conflicts, and child and forced labor​​​​​​​. BlackRock's holdings have been involved in land grabbing in Indonesia, and found guilty in Liberia of illegal deforestation, destruction of endangered chimpanzee habitats, and the use of violence and coercion to forcibly take community lands. Aside from deforestation, BlackRock is the largest investor in coal worldwide, including in developing new plants. Coal is the world's deadliest fossil fuel, damaging people's health, destroying local ecosystems, and acting as the main driver of climate change worldwide. Is a major investor in Tar sands, worse for climate than any other oil extraction; top shareholder in all the major companies seeking to drill the Arctic; and it is also one of the biggest investors in nearly every oil company operating in the Western Amazon. Recent oil spills from an unknown source blighting the Northeastern coast of Brazil, which have damaged tourism and local livelihoods in the region that voted majoritarily against President Jair Bolsonaro's Election, have been met by dismissal from local and National government. State responses include misinformation that contaminated beaches and seafood are 'safe', accusations that NGOs are behind the spills, and a lack of state support in clean-up operations - which are being led by fishermen and grassroots groups. Deforestation and degradation of vast swathes of land for commodities​​​​​​ are responsible for almost one quarter of all global greenhouse gas emissions, and are the leading cause of land conflict and death of frontline forest guardians. As the Amazon rainforest burns and Brazil's coastline surges with toxic tides, BlackRock is reaping the profits of human rights violations, environmental destruction and climate chaos.​​​​​​​ As the world’s largest asset manager, controlling more funds than the GDP of Japan, BlackRock could take advantage of its privileged position in the markets, and become a weapon in leading deforestation-risk free funds, and paving the way for a just transition towards a sustainable decarbonised lievable planet. A global boycott to save the rainforest Although BlackRock is one of the biggest and most influential companies driving this damage, it's by no means the only player in the game. APIB and Amazon Watch's recent 'Complicity in Destruction' report highlights the role of large commodity traders such as meatpackers and and agro-industrial producers JBS, Bunge, Mafrig, ADM and Cargill. Brazil's National Indigenous Mobilisation (MNI) has called for a boycott of commodities such as beef, leather, timber, soy and sugar produced on conflict land to tackle the economic benefits of aggressive land-grabbing and deforestation in Latin America - and Extinction Rebellion are seeking collaboration with other activist groups to answer the call. The '#BoycottForAmazonia' campaign firstly asks activists to stop buying products linked to Amazon deforestation and human rights abuses, but doesn't stop there. Activists are encouraged to ""#PaintTheStreets"", using protest performances, flyposting, and disruptive counter-advertising to raise awareness of the problem and which companies are profiting from the crisis in Amazonia. Targets for boycotts, divestment and sanctions include companies all across the supply chain contributing to the crisis, from traders like JBS, to financiers like BlackRock and HSBC, through to retailers who stock the products sourced from deforested areas, such as Burger King, McDonalds and Sainsbury's. The boycott is set to continue for at least one full year, but could be renewed if companies aren't seen to take concrete action. A Facebook event promoting the boycott has already attracted several hundred signups. Notes to editors About Extinction Rebellion: Time has almost entirely run out to address the ecological crisis which is upon us, including the 6th mass species extinction, global pollution, and abrupt, runaway climate change. Societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by scientists and other credible voices, with human extinction also a possibility, if rapid action is not taken. Extinction Rebellion believes it is a citizen’s duty to rebel, using peaceful civil disobedience, when faced with criminal inactivity by their Government. Extinction Rebellion’s key demands are: Government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change. Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/11/12/brazil-france-finance/,"Brazilian Indigenous Leaders Denounce the Role of French Financiers in Amazon Destruction Tuesday 12th November 2019, Paris (FRANCE) – Eight Brazilian indigenous leaders led a spirited protest along with 100 supporters in a Parisian financial center today, targeting the key role of French investors behind mounting human rights and environmental destruction in the Amazon. France hosts several leading financial institutions - such as BNP Paribas and Société Générale - responsible for bankrolling deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes with billions of euros in loans and underwriting to corporations that deal directly in forest risk commodities such as soy and beef. See images of the protest here Leaders from the Association of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples (APIB) are on an intense advocacy tour across Europe denouncing an exacerbating human rights crisis faced by the country’s indigenous communities and territories under the Bolsonaro’s government. Entitled Indigenous Blood: Not a Single Drop More, the delegation calls on European political authorities and business leaders to respond to growing violence and environmental devastation in the Amazon and across Brazil. On November 1st, an indigenous Forest Guardian, Paulo Paulino Guajajara, was shot dead after illegal loggers ambushed him on his Amazonian territory, in yet another emblematic case of brutality against Brazilian environmental and human rights defenders. “Many European companies are exploiting the Amazon directly in our territories,” said Sonia Guajajara, a member of the APIB delegation. “Today we are already feeling the effect of this unrestrained exploitation, and it won't take long for it to also reach you here, in France. European corporations must be conscious of their responsibility. Everything is at stake: the rainforest, the climate, and our survival. It is very important to act quickly while there is still time!"" Last April, data from an APIB report, produced in partnership with Amazon Watch showed how European and US companies, including banks and soy traders, enable today’s crisis in the Amazon region. The research analyzed Brazilian companies fined for environmental crimes in the Amazon since 2017 and identified linkages between these and northern countries' commercial interests. Recent events, such as the Amazon fires, increasingly show how local and global corporate interests are driving deforestation, exacerbating land conflicts, and spurring violence. “Big banks and large investment firms in particular play a critical role, providing billions of euros in lending, underwriting, and equity investment to soy and cattle companies,” said Christian Poirier, Amazon Watch Program Director, who joined the protest in Paris. “This financing enables agribusiness to maintain and expand operations, causing further devastation to the Amazon and Cerrado. BNP Paribas has over US$3 billion invested across the world's four largest soy traders, as well as other investments in Brazilian meat-packers.” Cattle ranching and soy production are the leading drivers of deforestation in Brazil. Ranching alone leads to approximately 80% of Amazon deforestation, and 80% of the Amazon forests cleared since 2014 are currently occupied by cattle. The economic and environmental implications of these commodities extend to the global market: Brazilian soy accounted for 14.3% of the country’s total exports, generating $31 billion in 2017 while cattle exports accounted for about $5.4 billion. Brazil leads the world in exports of both commodities. If global consumers continue to provide a market for these commodities, these industries will enjoy considerable economic incentives to aggressively expand activities, to the detriment of forest protections and indigenous land rights. “Extinction Rebellion stands by APIB and its leaders in their efforts to amplify the role of the global financial sector in Amazon destruction through an international solidarity campaign. Because the genocide against indigenous people in Brazil is real, forces must be joined among allies in a battle for survival. Extinction Rebellion is their global ally, one country at a time,” said an Extinction Rebellion France spokesperson who attended the Parisian protest. The protest in Paris had the support of civil society organizations, like Alerte France Bresil, Planète Amazone, Autres Bresils, Weaving Ties, Extinction Rebellion France, Amazon Watch, Nature Rights Citoyens Pour le Climat Paris, and others.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/31/global-hunger-strike/,"“I need to do this to be able to sleep at night:” Extinction Rebellion to Launch Global Hunger Strike on November 18 XR Rebels from Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Germany, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the United States, and more to go on hunger strike 820 million people already suffer from hunger and starvation worldwide while billions of are at risk of starvation and death from climate and ecological collapse Action to highlight how millions are already living through the hell of our Planetary Crisis. Migrant justice and the rights of indigenous peoples must be put at the heart of efforts to end the climate and ecological breakdown Earth, 13 November 2019 - Following October’s global rebellion, which mobilized tens of thousands in mass non-violent civil disobedience, Extinction Rebellion rebels from around the world will go on hunger strike on November 18 to demand that governments act on the climate and ecological emergency that threatens the extinction of a million species, the collapse of civilizations and the death of billions of humans. Over 100 rebels in several countries will starve themselves as part of the XR Global Hunger Strike. Many of these rebels will not consume food for one week and others will go for a longer period of time. They will go on hunger strike in solidarity with people starving because of climate and ecological breakdown and to force governments to confront the crisis by enacting Extinction Rebellion’s three demands. They are employing this last resort tactic after more than three decades of petitions, protests and campaigns have failed to secure the urgently needed responses to mitigate ecological and climate breakdown. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase and widespread ecological destruction is accelerating. Our leaders have abandoned us as the catastrophe escalates with each passing day. By denying themselves of their basic needs, the hunger strikers hopes that their bodies will sound the alarm. Strikes will take place in symbolic locations across multiple countries, including Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Giovanni Tamacas, a 20-year-old US student and international coordinator with the Global Hunger Strike, said: “We are hunger striking because we have no choice. We are being taken to our deaths. Greedy governments and corporations have criminally and catastrophically failed to tackle the climate and ecological emergency. Our shortsighted governments are too systemically corrupt to stop mass starvation, societal collapse, and the death of billions of humans. We are therefore demanding that governments commission and be led by the decisions of an independent Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.” In August, Tamacas went on a solo ten-day hunger strike in front of the White House that has inspired many to strike with him this month. “I did cry. And I did feel extreme frustration and hunger and just overwhelming feelings of sadness at times,” said Tamacas. “But at the end of the day I remembered what I was fighting for and that’s what kept me going.” Tamacas’s mother is from Vietnam and his father is from El Salvador, countries that are reeling from climate and ecological collapse. The hunger strikers recognize that what they are doing is minor compared to the truly dire starvation that ten percent of the world’s population faces. They have the privilege of being able to choose when to eat, so the strike is carried out in solidarity with communities worldwide and particularly with those in the Global South who are forcibly starved. They also strike in solidarity with prisoners, migrants and racially marginalised peoples who hunger strike as a last resort against systemic oppression. And they do strike in solidarity with those who have pioneered, and continue to use, this incredibly powerful last resort tactic as a means to liberate themselves from the shackles of depression, apathy, and oppression. Throughout history, hunger striking has been is historically a deeply-personal measure of last resort. It was used by Mahatma Gandhi in the Indian Independence Movement, Marion Wallace Dunlop in the women’s suffrage movement, US prisoners protesting solitary confinement, the students of Tiananmen Square, and other movements. Christina Dithmar, a 16-year-old with Extinction Rebellion Germany, will also participate, “I don’t want to hunger strike. I’m fully aware of all risks this brings with it as well as the fact that I’m actually too young to do a full hunger strike. Yet, I don’t see any other option given where we are headed. I don’t want to lie in my bed crying, feeling helpless, not taken seriously.” A strict 24 hours limit on the hunger strike is imposed for participants under 18 and they must have both medical and parental consent to take part. All hunger strikers will be supported physically and emotionally by their community of fellow rebels The Global Hunger Strike builds on the recent XR hunger strikers in Italy. On October 15 Italian hunger strikers secured a meeting with Italy’s Environmental Minister. In August, an Italian rebel, Filippo Guerrini, forced Bologna’s city council to accept all of the rebellion’s three core demands. “They will not be able to ignore us anymore,” said 27-year-old Filippo Guerrini. “We will force the institutions to look us in the eyes and listen to our requests. This time we will choose the sacrifice, the individual sacrifice. We will stop eating. Our bodies will be their alarm.” High quality photos of the XR hunger strikes will be available here For more information please contact the XR Global Hunger Strike press team: Nick Brana: nickbrana@protonmail.com Miles Amoore: xrdcmedia@protonmail.com For more information from any of the countries involved, including how to cover the hunger strikes in your country, please contact: Canada: Sarah sarahbenz@protonmail.com Democratic Republic of the Congo: Jeremie adebaarusi@gmail.com Germany: Chittranjan chittranjan.dubey@gmail.com Italy: Guerrini guerrini.fil@gmail.com Sweden: Sofia sofia.boren@gmail.com United Kingdom: Marijn marijnvandegeer@googlemail.com United States: Giovanni gtamacas@protonmail.com {% include icons/facebook.svg %} {% include icons/instagram.svg %} {% include icons/twitter.svg %} {% include icons/youtube.svg %} share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/27/newsletter-30/,"This rebellion is by no means over: the past week has seen continued actions in Austria, The Netherlands, Hong Kong, Berlin, Sydney… as ever, more than we can count! But for many of those reading, this week was the beginning of some well-earned rest, and the start of a reflection process. In this first of several retrospective issues, we begin to look back together on the October Rebellion. We bring you exclusive accounts that could only be articulated once the heat of action had cooled a little. Undeniably, this Rebellion has seen XR step up across the world – in terms of numbers, intensity, creativity, visibility, and more. We saw a leap in the profile of those declaring their support for the movement, with royalty, actors, journalists, and politicians using their platforms to support XR, and some even facing arrest. Rebels in many countries have developed their civil disobedience superpowers, deploying new and creative tactics – in this issue, we see how cross-national solidarity between rebels has been used to the advantage of protests in Central Europe (Slovakia, Czech Republic). At the same time, we have seen the police step up its response to XR in sometimes shocking and brutal ways. More than during the April Rebellion, it is as if brute force has been mobilised in the service of shoring up the denial of climate and ecological breakdown. Rebels seem undeterred however, even where they are facing a public still largely unaware of the emergency (e.g. Czech Republic, Italy). The crucial process of holding to account those involved in the Rebellion has begun – and we don’t mean only the courageous arrestees: as we detail below, investigations into police excesses have started in Belgium and in the UK. (In the UK an investigation is being conducted by Netpol into excessive or discriminatory policing – they need eye-witness statements to make their case please see here to help. If you’re not in the UK, but have had similar experiences, we can only encourage you to contact legal networks to begin a similar process!) Taking responsibility is not something we merely ask of others: the time is also for apologies where these are felt to be necessary, for example, the heartfelt letter from XR Belgium to members of the public and rebels caught up in the police response. This retrospective newsletter features longer pieces that allow rebels to share their experience of Rebellion more intimately. We are struck by the raw humanity of rebel hunger strikers in Italy; the pain of the 14-year-old rebel from Slovakia, brutally unglued by the police. The often touching photos lay bare a whole spectrum of emotions – cheekiness, anger, puzzlement, determination, playfulness. A reminder of our complex but ultimately common humanity. As these reflections begin to paint a fuller picture of the whirlwind that was Rebellion, it seems clear that what we have lost in innocence, we have gained in numbers, in determination, in skill and in solidarity. Whatever the future may hold, this at least is clear: we are now a community of truly international scale, and we will not stop until we see the change we need. If you’d like to help, please check out our guide and learn more about XR. To connect to rebels in your local area, get in touch with your nearest XR group. If there’s no active group near you, you can start your own! If you’d like to see previous newsletter issues, you can find them here. As we enter this crucial phase in human history, our Rebellion will need money to make sure our message is heard. Anything you can give is appreciated. October was massive for UK rebels. And for many who strained heart and sinew, the time has come for some well deserved rest. But some push on, with inventive and powerful protests. On Sunday, a small group of rebels stripped off on the floor of the National Portrait Gallery, while others poured fake oil over their naked bodies. The gallery is the home of the BP Portrait Award, an exhibition funded by oil and gas company ‘Beyond Petroleum’. The action highlighted the tragic destruction of life caused by the drills and spills of oil and gas companies like BP. The following day, XR families and educators called on the Department for Education to ‘tell the truth’ and bring the climate emergency into the school curriculum. “Climate and ecological breakdown will define the life of every child alive today,” said one rebel, “but it’s hard for them to take the issue seriously, when it plays almost no part in the content of their education.” Little rebels brought a first ever love-in to the Maritime Museum. United in song, they stood in solidarity with families across the world already impacted by climate change, especially those in the global south. They also visited the new home of our Polly Higgins boat and honoured Polly’s fight to make ecocide a crime. Coming up this week in London, we have a Rebellion-inspired piano concert ‘Music From Our Times’ on Wed 30 and a Rebel Rave on Fri 1st to raise money for legal aid for our brave arrestees (buy tickets here). If you can’t make these but feel like tying up some loose ends, a debrief might be the thing you need – and the good news is, setting them up just got a whole lot easier with this guide. We’d also like to encourage any rebels who were present in London to take a look at this request from Netpol – your statement could make a crucial difference in holding the Met to account for their actions earlier this month. More happened in October than we could possibly report on. Each country’s rebellion has its own joys and tribulations, its own unique flavour. Read on to be seriously inspired! The October Rebellion enabled XR to introduce itself to the French media and political world, and to a large part of the population. This spectacular introduction, intended to draw more rebels in, laid the foundations for even more disruptive and dramatic actions in the future. There is little doubt that this week of massive non-violent civil disobedience created a shock wave in the country of ‘La Grande Révolution.’ XR’s political aims and methods have struck many other protest movements in France as culturally strange, especially those on the radical left. The sun sets after a fifth day of occupation in the centre of Paris The difference between XR and more ‘traditional’ methods of protest in the country, as well as its political message, drew critiques and commendations from social and anti-authoritarian movements, public commentators and intellectuals alike. These certainly deserve to be heard and thought through, even if they indicate a certain reactionary attitude within the French left itself. These criticisms could prove to help XR France mature, and provide a fruitful disruption and inspiration for other social movements in the country. In effect, the October Rebellion has offered an opportunity for both XR France and movements such as the Yellow Vests to grow more impactful, both in strategy and in their political aims and messaging. Having begun to form alliances in the first days of the rebellion, now is the time to reflect on how to collaborate more successfully with one another moving forward. On October 5th, XR co-occupied a Parisian Shopping Centre with the Yellow Vests and other groups In the face of the task ahead of us, we might together concede that we will need a full spectrum of tactics to reach our shared goal: that is, to dismantle the toxic structures which are the source of this generation’s emergency. Read a full analysis and response to criticisms of the French Rebellion here. Potential new recruits at ‘Fragile Hope’, an XR Prague Parents event Saturday 12th marked the final day of a week-long rebellion for XR Czechia, and the day was to hold two of their most audacious actions. Rebels took over Wenceslas Square, one of Prague’s busiest, to hold a ‘Saturday Festival’ full of live music, theatre, and workshops about the climate and ecological crisis. Meanwhile, on an adjacent highway, around 200 rebels formed a blockade to stop the capital’s afternoon traffic. At least eight rebels glued themselves to the road. Police managed to clear the blockade in under 15 minutes, but they did so brutally. It resulted in one woman being scalded with hot water (which police believed would dissolve the glue), another woman suffering significant bruising as she was hauled away. And a 14-year-old girl having skin ripped away from her hand. She was glued to another rebel and the police, who appeared unprepared and seemingly unaware of the practice, simply tore them apart. The 14 year old girl whose glued hand was torn free (Photo: Petr Zewlakk Vrabec) As she cried, a rebel medic tried to help her but the police had already formed a cordon around the road and wouldn’t let anyone through. ‘We have our own medics,’ was the police response. The police medics did eventually arrive and were seriously alarmed, mistakenly believing the girl’s hand was dissolving from chemicals in the glue. She was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, her mother by her side. On the journey, the girl was given a misdemeanour citation and was released a few hours later. Police held the blockade rebels for five and a half hours Most rebels were kept for far longer. There were 130 arrests in all, and the police seemed totally at a loss with how to deal with so many. They decided to process all of them, including the minors and the injured, in an impromptu holding area by the road. Those rebels whose ID cards had already been registered by the police after previous actions were arrested and bussed to the local police station. Whilst they were ultimately released later that night, they are likely to face substantial fines. Those rebels whose IDs showed no previous XR activity were cautioned and eventually released after a five-and-a-half-hour wait on the roadside. They sang and chanted throughout the night to keep their spirits high. A road swarm meets with anger on the streets of Prague XR Czech Republic is spearheaded by a loving group of around 400 dedicated activists. Generally speaking, though, public opinion is not with them — in part because of a hostile corporate media that misreports actions and sidelines the climate crisis entirely. Through their Saturday Festival and other events across the week, Czech rebels have sought to recruit a new wave of rebels; but they also know that to change this nation’s mindset, they have a lot of work ahead. The first ‘swarm’ in the history of Slovakia It is the morning of Monday 7th October, the first day of rebellion for so many across the world. Twenty Slovak rebels walked in single file across a zebra crossing on a street outside the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Bratislava. But rather than cross the street, they blocked it. Two big hand-painted XR banners were unfurled to face the waiting traffic. People in their cars looked bemused, unsure about what was going on. A bus driver started to get angry, inching his large vehicle closer to the rebels, gesturing and shouting from behind the glass. Thankfully the agreed seven-minute wait was up before things could get violent, and the rebels part like waves. The traffic returns to its normal flow, and no police arrived. It is as if nothing had happened. But the beaming rebels know differently. This was their first-ever direct action. It was Slovakia’s first-ever swarm. This was seven minutes of history. Later that day, the rebels notified Slovakia’s national media about this milestone. They also hosted a seminar about how to turn kitchen and bathroom household waste into garden compost. The press interest was muted however: the next morning, only one newspaper ran the story. XR Slovakia is only a few months old and its membership is still modest in size. In spite of this, actions came thick and fast during Rebellion Week. On Wednesday 9th a group of seventy cyclists rode through Bratislava, passing various Ministries and gridlocking traffic. Again the police did not impose, and no one was arrested. Three Slovak women on the front line of the rebel blockade in Prague The next day, Thursday 10th, twelve rebels took a trip to Prague to join their Czech sisters and brothers. All were part of the Saturday blockade that saw the Czech police kettle nearly 200 rebels, injuring two women and a teenage girl in the process. The Slovaks’ foreign status actually helped them in this instance. The added bureaucracy involved in processing their foreign ID cards meant that the overstretched Czech police were never going to arrest them. Instead, the visitors spent their last night on the roadside, chanting with their Czech comrades for the five and a half hours it took for the police to release them. XR Slovakia performed a funeral march during the global strike called for by ‘Fridays for Future’ Critical Mass passes through Piazza Venezia Asked for her favourite action of the week, a rebel from the Rome media team smiles and answers quickly: ‘The Critical Mass. A hundred and fifty of us riding bikes through the centre of the city, blocking traffic for three hours’. Italian police knew the starting point of the action and followed the swarm of bicycles in two big trucks as the riders cut through red lights and brought the city streets to a standstill. But there were no arrests. In fact, there have never been any arrests of rebels in Italy. ‘The police just video-record our faces,’ says the rebel from Rome. ‘Throughout the week, over the course of seven major actions, the police have just watched and waited and filmed everyone.’ Italian rebel on day six of his hunger strike A public endorsement from Michael Stipe, lead singer of REM, visiting Rome for an art convention, gained press coverage but it was the rebel hunger strikers who sat in a square outside the Italian Parliament which drew the most media attention. Of the fifteen who started, ten hunger strikers made it through the whole week. Three were forced to end their strike because of health fears. But thanks to a couple of supportive MEPs, the hunger strikers were visited by Italy’s Environment Minister, Sergio Costa. The senior politician listened to the hunger strikers, but only for a minute or so. He had a more important agenda for this meeting: turning to the assembled press and lauding his ‘emergency bill about the climate’, a bill that had passed into Italian law only the day before. Rebel hunger strikers outside Montecitorio Palace, the Italian parliament Like so many similar bills which have been lauded by governments around the world, the substance did not match the title. While the bill introduces measures to tackle plastic use and offers financial incentives for drivers of older model cars to upgrade it remains silent on the issues of carbon emissions, fossil fuel usage and air travel. The phrase ‘fiddling while Rome burns’ has rarely been more apt. Environment Minister Sergio Costa meets the hunger strikers It was a real achievement that the hunger strikers got any press coverage at all. Mostly, the Italian media has ignored the climate and ecological crisis, and totally ignored Extinction Rebellion’s efforts to highlight it. The vast majority of people in Italy don’t know that there is a climate problem, let alone its true scale. During the actions in the capital, the most supportive passers-by were tourists. XR Italy is comprised of only a couple of hundred dedicated rebel hearts, but the week of actions has done wonders, both in terms of the skills and systems that have been passed on through workshops, and the bonds that have been created through direct actions. Trust and camaraderie has grown strong between these rebellious Romans, and new chapters are now springing up daily around the country. One thing is for sure. The Italian police will be needing to record more videos. Many of us were shocked by the events in Belgium on Saturday 12th, when over 400 peaceful rebels were savagely beaten, soaked, pepper-sprayed, and arrested on their first day of protest. Authorities in Brussels have since opened up an inquiry exploring the unlawful conduct of the police. A total of four separate disciplinary investigations have been launched to address the potential use of excessive force and unacceptable violence. Meanwhile, we spoke to a rebel on the ground about his experience of the night: ‘It’s hard to describe what it’s like to be hit in the face by pepper-spray. The best comparison I can think of, is hell. Everything burns and you feel completely disoriented. Out of this world. You can’t see, or smell, or even breathe.’ ‘It’s like someone has poured a cocktail of tabasco and bleach down your throat. And there’s nothing you can do. Water makes it worse. You just have to wait it out.’ Rest assured, Extinction Rebellion will be paying very close attention to the results of the police enquiry. On Tuesday 15th, XR spokesperson Linde Polfliet appeared on national television channel VRTto discuss our peaceful values and denounce the criminal actions of the police. XR Belgium have also released a heartfelt statement addressing ‘the negligent and stupid brutality of the illegal police action that ruined a truly beautiful and inspiring afternoon of citizen cooperation’. The statement generously apologises to all XR members and members of the public who were caught up in ‘the nightmare that we all experienced.’ It celebrates the indomitable spirit of those who made the stand and ends with a reminder that: ‘the system, of which we are part of, is afraid. It does not know what to do (…) It needs our help to go forward. It needs us.’ You can read the statement in full here. Deeds not Words An overview of police response to the October Rebellion, in London and around the world. Our October Rebellion received many different responses: energy and excitement from new rebels across the world, love and community with returning rebels, curiosity from passersby, some grumbles from grumpy commuters in a rush, but also a new level of intimidation and aggression from the police. In London, police swooped in before the rebellion even began, raiding a storage space, confiscating equipment, including dangerous pink pillows and making arrests. Over the following days, police continued with arrests and confiscated all manner of items from rebels, including food and tents. In true rebellious spirit, pink pillows popped up all over London and the Rebellion was on again. Rebels continued to defy police aggression, even when it hit an all time low with police targeting more vulnerable rebels by confiscating wheelchairs and equipment supporting disabled rebels to protest. But as the rebel spirit couldn’t be knocked down, the police responded with increasingly draconian measures curtailing the right to protest; initially by restricting protest to Trafalgar Square and then banning all XR protests from London. Greta tweeted: ‘If standing up against the climate and ecological breakdown and for humanity is against the rules then the rules must be broken’. The disproportionate London-wide ban on XR protests backfired. Galvanising support from those who recognised how dangerous a development this was, including Amnesty International who called the banchilling and unlawful’. Green Party Co-Leader Jonathan Bartley and journalist George Monbiot were amongst those arrested the following day for deliberately defying it. The legality of the ban is now being challenged in the High Court, while Netpol is launching a parliamentary report which you can help with by offering a statement. Unfortunately the UK hasn’t been the only place where, instead of acting on the climate and ecological emergency, politicians have instead turned on peaceful protest. In Australia, the Queensland parliament criminalised locking devices and extended police powers, shortly after Australian police faced criticism for their use of strip searches and imposition of extreme bail conditions. Use of pain compliance techniques against peaceful earth protectors was reported in Germany and Spain, while non-violent protest in Brussels was met with police violence far beyond anything experienced before. These extreme responses to peaceful action show that those in power are running scared and panicking. Attempts to ignore and ridicule XR have failed and they recognise the force of change we now represent. The way forward doesn’t require further draconian steps on a path towards a police state with no civil liberties; all that is needed, is taking action on the climate and ecological emergency. ‘I don’t think enough is being done. This feels like a huge joke or something, a nightmare, but it’s not. It’s the reality. I just wanted to try anything I can to change this horrible reality. I think I’d regret not doing anything. I think here (the City of London) is the right place to do it. I study Economics and I feel so strongly that something has to change. The banks should be diverting resources to renewable projects which will create jobs. They’re just not doing that, they’re stuck in their short-termism and their quarterly reports and shareholder values and things. It’s always been really hard for me because I’m an overseas student and I used to fly a lot. I think that if I believe that it is such a catastrophe then why am I still flying? So I’ve stopped flying and I’m looking at alternatives such as trains back to Hong Kong. I’m consuming so much less now and I’ve realised that makes me a happier person. I grew up in a concrete jungle and I’ve always been taught that shopping is fun, but I never really took a moment to consider where my happiness comes from. I think that would be true for a lot of people, it’s just the culture that we grew up in.’ We are receiving amazing human stories and we want to know yours.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/15/rebel-daily-7/,"But things are changing. The past week has been a moment in history: to simply list the thousands of arrests, the many tens of thousands undertaking civil disobedience, would not do it justice. We have proven to the world that this rebellion is a truly global movement, growing rapidly within and between nations, and comprised of people with the selflessness, the creativity and the courage to resist the madness of this ecocidal system. In each country, we’re only beginning to see the political and cultural ramifications. For all the actions we report here (even these are just some of many), it’s impossible to do justice to the hard work and love that goes into them, and the creativity, joy and community which result. There is little space to convey the significance of that action, and the impact it leaves on media discourse and national dialogue. But rest assured, every act of disobedience sends ripples, big or small. In the broadest frame, a media monitoring service informs us that in the last week, Extinction Rebellion has featured in 53,490 media pieces with a ‘potential audience’ reach of many millions. Our message is being heard on TV, radio, print and online. And sure enough, online interest in our movement has shot through the roof. As today’s stories show, this is not an interest contained to any single continent or country. A global crisis needs a global movement, and this is what we are becoming. At every level our actions this week have challenged mindsets, confronted systems and strengthened our movement with bonds of love and solidarity. This International Rebellion isn’t over, but we’re already beginning to see its effects. As we enter this crucial phase in human history, our Rebellion will need money to make sure our message is heard. Anything you can give is appreciated. 12-13 OCT | India On Saturday, 50 rebels took to the streets of Odisha’s capital city, Bhubaneswar. A die-in was followed by a moment of silence to pay tribute to all fellow activists who have been arrested. Attendees signed a letter to the Chief Minister of the State of Odisha calling for immediate action to address the climate and ecological emergency. At the weekend, XR Guwahati was at the ‘The Big Burp’ – the city’s first food and music festival. Their stall provided information on the ecological crisis and invited visitors to sign up for future actions. On the second day, group members took to the stage to address the crowd, accompanied by an XR video on the big screen. This fantastic opportunity was in part due to the XR group including members of local band Rain In Sahara. XR Delhi held a mixed day of regeneration on Sunday in Central Park. They hosted an information point and ran sessions on yoga, guided meditation, eco-anxiety, and live music, before moving on to the day’s main focus: holding people’s assemblies in public spaces. To demonstrate their belief in positive action, alongside disruption they finished the day by asking people to join them in a trash clean up. 14 OCT | London, UK Rebels in London flooded the financial district, from Barclays to the Bank of England, with tremendous XR energy! No bank would take a risk like the one this government is taking with our lives, one rebel points out. Some dressed as canaries and glued themselves to the Walkie Talkie Building, enacting the Irish President’s quip that ‘if we were miners we would be up to our knees in dead canaries.’ Others staged theatrics outside BlackRock, the world’s largest investor in coal mines and oil and gas companies. Still more simply sat in the middle of the road outside the Bank of England, not least an emeritus Rabbi and lifelong environmental activist. Just before his arrest, he described Extinction Rebellion: “It is activism, but underneath it’s also about rebuilding, about showing that a society can function better when people collaborate.” London rebels have been offered a number of ‘sanctuary’ spaces, which became especially important after a surprise visit by the police to Trafalgar Square, very late at night. Numerous rebels were arrested and the site was cleared, except for one 71-year-old Welsh farmer who valiantly glued on. Monday evening saw the police push the boundaries of the law and remove XR’s right to protest in London. But we will not be deterred. At the end of Day 8, rebels sleep peacefully in Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, as they wait to see what tomorrow brings. Fear not, we still have a few tricks up our sleeves.

Get familiar with Rebellion week 2’s planned mass actions, and COME ON DOWN. 14 OCT | Berlin, Germany Monday marked the final day of the Berlin Climate Camp and the packed schedule of actions across the city finally came to an end. Each day, the Climate Camp has featured a ‘town hall’ intended to breathe life into the third demand that climate and ecological justice be led by the decisions of a Citizen’s Assembly. After a week of open and productive discussions from expert speakers and a good deal of debate, some of the resulting ideas were displayed outside the camp, situated opposite the Reichstag parliament building. A lack of official comment from the German government over the past week makes it difficult to know how much they’ve been listening. In response, German rebels said that whilst their camp may be over, their work continues. They also said a hearty farewell and thank you to all the Scandinavian rebels – Swedes, Danes, Norwegians and Finns – who are now returning to their homelands. They helped make the Berlin rebellion a resounding and multinational success. 13 OCT | Jakarta, Indonesia Rebels in the sinking city of Jakarta, notorious for its intense traffic, marched four kilometres down the biggest major toll road in Indonesia’s ill-fated capital on Sunday. They demand action on the climate crisis that threatens to submerge 95% of the city by 2050. Jakarta is sinking from land subsidence due to draining aquifers below, meaning half the city is now below sea level. Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo announced a relocation of the country’s capital city to a yet-to-be-built city on the island of Borneo, which is already suffering from massive deforestation and repeated fires ravaging its forests. 11 – 13 OCT | Montreal, Quebec, Canada Montreal isn’t sleeping on the job in this Rebellion. About 40 rebels woke the city up to the emergency in style and slowed down traffic with a ‘pyjama swarm’. Rebels repeatedly crossed the street at a red light, and stood in the road for a few minutes with suitable (polite) signage before moving aside to let traffic through. On Saturday, 60 rebels formed the city’s inaugural critical mass bike ride along Sherbrooke Ouest. Dressed for the occasion with XR Flags, signs and freshly-cut weeds, the cycles peacefully occupied one lane and held a space about a block long, with support from the SPVM (Montreal police) who even encouraged them to ride through the red lights! On Sunday, in a creative twist on the standard die-in, 50 rebels took a symbolic sip of KlimAde before collapsing, a refreshing beverage ‘to COOL you down as the planet HEATS up!’, available in four flavours: Delicious Denial, Delicate Despair, Berrylicious Business as Usual, and Irresistible Inaction. 14-year-old rebel Bea explained that the event was to educate people about the psychological barriers to taking action. As appealing as they sound, all flavours unfortunately lead to extinction. This action in downtown Montreal marked the end of their week of rebellion, but rest assured more disruption is in the pipeline. 14 OCT | Banjul, Gambia Earth protectors in the Gambia suffered heavy downpours before an action in capital city Banjul, yesterday, organised by local conservation organisation, Climate Save Gambia. Organisers claim not enough is being done to address the fact that “awareness about climate extremes among the people of the Gambia is too low”. Local XR members rescued children on their way to school from the torrential onslaught, before marching through the city. Children chanted demands for climate justice, as the group called on their government to “take drastic measures to put a stop to the menace and trauma our children face daily.” 13 OCT | Melbourne, Australia Rebels in Melbourne brought their rebellion to a close with a drown-in on Sunday, marking an “act of symbolic drowning and rising anew”. Over 500 rebels marched on land stolen from the aboriginal Wurrundjeri-willam people, to Brunswick St. in the inner suburb of Fitzroy. The drown-in was a sombre affair, led by a funeral procession to honour earth protectors who have lost their lives in the fight for our future. Marine-themed props were also in abundance. No arrests were made and the overall mood was a celebratory end to a week-long rebellion that saw 111 rebels arrested. 12 OCT | Colombo, Sri Lanka On Saturday, XR Sri Lanka co-hosted its first ever beach cleanup strike at the Dehiwala beach in Colombo. More than 40 volunteers attended the event and collected over 50 bags of waste from just a 250-metre stretch. Local children also joined the action. All the collected waste was separated and sent to be recycled. All the Styrofoam will be given back to manufacturers. Rebels also staged a die-in at the beach to raise awareness on the devastating effects of ocean pollution and the climate emergency.Sri Lanka are the second most vulnerable country to the effects of the climate crisis, a tragic reminder that those who contribute the least to the climate emergency are the ones who will suffer the most. They plan to host many more beach clean-ups, as well as reforestation rebellions. See more of the beautiful and courageous action from the International Rebellion in XR Unchained. There is so much to tell. Rome. Italian Rebels end their seven day fast with a meal of ashes, symbolising food scarcity on a dying planet.

I was living in California and doing political activism over there for the climate and also for civil rights, and the part of me that is really British was noticing stuff that was happening over here in London, and there was some kind of a sense that I was meant to be here. So I basically packed up my life of 30 years over there and moved back indefinitely, most likely permanently. Because there’s nothing more urgent. My daily life is totally affected by knowing there’s a climate emergency going on, and to be honest, because I was living in California when Donald Trump was elected I actually made a vow that morning, that if I was to die early it would be because I was fighting on behalf of the Earth. Ever since then I’ve lived with this sort of pressure, like when you know a storm is coming.’ We are receiving amazing human stories and we want to know yours.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/14/rebel-daily-6/,"It’s been quite a weekend. We’ve seen no slowing down of global actions: Berlin, London, Australia, Turkey – as ever, more than we can name. But today’s showstoppers are undoubtedly the rebels in the Netherlands, Czech Republic, and most of all in Belgium. Well over 700 arrests took place in these three countries, 435 in Brussels alone, but these numbers on their own say nothing of the extraordinary courage shown by rebels in the face of some of the most appalling treatment our movement has yet faced. Rebels form Extinction symbol on Bondi Beach (epic sweeping drone footage here). We stand together. Whether it’s teargas in Brussels or Paris, injuries from excessive force in Prague, police discrimination in London, undemocraticnew laws in Australia, or state repression in any other nation, our answer is always the same: compassionate, powerful nonviolence. Every peaceful protester mistreated by the police means ten more in their place tomorrow; every video of state violence in a ‘democratic’ state is paid for with that government’s legitimacy. We’re changing the world – there’s no question of that. The question governments must ask themselves is whether they will speed that process up with repression, or speed it up with genuine democratic dialogue.

Support the Rebellion 12 OCT | Brussels, Belgium Police confronting Olivier de Schutter, UCL professor and former UN special rapporteur on the right to food. Credit: Francois Dvorak Scenes of violence shook the European capital as over 400 peaceful protesters were brutally arrested. Using water cannons, pepper-spray, batons and shields, police tore through a crowd of approximately 1000 people, wounding and traumatizing with an air of mockery and spite. This is without doubt the most striking display of aggression that we’ve seen thus far, as well as being the biggest mass arrest in XR’s short history. The protest, part of #RoyalRebellion, took place on Koningsplein near the royal palace. (One of the family, at least, is already convinced:Princess Esmeralda was arrested with us in London earlier this week). At around 2pm, rebels occupied the square in true XR style. They brought flags, musical instruments and good intentions. They even brought a boat. At around 5pm the police began to move in, and by 6.30pm it was all over. In the space of an hour and a half, hundreds of people were pepper-sprayed in the face, including a 2-year-old girl. The police used the water cannon three times, pummelling the seated protesters with ice-cold water. They wrestled non-violent rebels to the ground, pressing their heads into the cobbles, and they laughed as they did it. Many of the rebels suffered panic and anxiety attacks as they lay shivering on the ground waiting to be led to the vans. Of the 435 arrests, 118 were released from the police station after an ID check, the other 317 were held until 3am and dropped off at random locations around the city, distressed and unable to get home as there was no public transport available. It’s difficult to articulate how shocking these reports are. Our hearts go out to all of those directly or indirectly affected; and our compassion must also extend to those on the other side of this violence: captives themselves of a system bigger than any individual. No words can say it better than those of the Belgium rebels who, even while they were being dragged to the ground and beaten, were still chanting: ‘We love you. We are peaceful. We do this for your children.’ Here is avideo of the arrests, and a full 45 minute livestream from a brave rebel. Warning: the content of these videos is violent and likely upsetting. 12 OCT | Prague, Czech Republic 130 rebels were detained by Czech police on Saturday when they lay down on a pedestrian crossing in the centre of Prague and blocked afternoon traffic. Police reacted quickly, and some rebels who were glued-on suffered minor injuries – their hands torn off the tarmac by officers with no experience of this kind of protest. The blockade fell on the same day as the funeral of Karel Gott, a singer so popular in the country that it was declared a day of national mourning. Asked why they did not call off the protest, rebels said: “Karel Gott lived a long and rich life and died peacefully in his sleep. This is something that we and our children may not get”. 12-13 OCT | Amsterdam Rebels in Amsterdam were active across three different sites this weekend, with at least 160 rebels arrested. Police were unable to prevent 300 rebels from dragging a yellow boat to the center of Blauwbrug bridge, which was blocked for several hours, disrupting tram, road and water traffic. Rebels stood side by side, holding their ground to remind us of our collective power in the face of an existential threat. When rebels were finally dispersed, after several hours, many were taken away by bus to the outskirts of the city. This did not, however, prevent Dutch rebels from rounding things off with an eye-grabbing projection in the city centre! 12 – 13 OCT | London, UK London hosted an array of brilliant actions over the weekend, but by far the largest and most eye-catching was the Extinction March: a sombre and highly imaginative funeral procession that allowed rebels to grieve for the ongoing ecocide. The march drew a crowd of more than 20,000 people, despite near continuous rain, and brought Oxford Street to a standstill for several hours. The procession included the work of more than 80 different XR arts & culture groups, with highlights including an aquarium’s worth of skeleton sea life, a giant human skull, a jazz funeral band, and a dodo sign saying ‘Wake up before we dodo’. In another major action of the weekend, hundreds gathered outside New Scotland Yard to protest the reprehensible police tactic of confiscating wheelchairs and other vital equipment needed by disabled rebels to stay safe. Elsewhere, theDoctors of XR laid 110 pairs of shoes on the steps of Trafalgar Square to represent the number of lives taken every day in the UK because of uncontrolled air pollution. Scientists declared support for Non-Violent Direct Action against the UK Government for its inaction over the climate crisis. And Greta’s speech was projected rather impressively onto the Houses of Parliament, alongside indigenous activists. In Trafalgar Square, there was a solidarity action with the Ecuadorian people, who are currently being shot and run over by their own police as they protest against their government’s brutal austerity measures. Across the Square, XR children gave a moving performance of their song ‘SOS from the Kids’.

OCT 12 | Assemblée Nationale, Paris, France After having set up camp for five days in the heart of Paris, cycled to the Arc de Triomphe and co-occupied the Italie 2 shopping centre with the Yellow Vests, it was time for French rebels to directly speak to those in power by demonstrating outside the French National Assembly. When rebels sat down directly in front of the assembly, which is forbidden to any demonstration, police pushed them to the neighboring bridge, and trapped them there for 7 hours with a police cordon. Rebels held a giant People’s Assembly to show the French government what real democracy looks like. Some rebels walked along the bridge’s narrow walls to leave, and some even threatened to jump into the Seine – prompting the arrival of two police boats. Rebels still danced and played games, even making the line of police officers smile. Meanwhile, XR and Youth For Climate France held a sit-in in front of the radio headquarters of Europe 1, until finally the station took a recording of the message they had to share. 12 – 13 OCT | Australia In Melbourne, shoppers saw more than they bargained for as the Nudie Parade took to the streets, demonstrating perfectly how to get vulnerable about the crisis. Later in the day, hundreds took part in a ‘mass drown-in’ to draw attention to rising sea levels, which was accompanied by a march, songs and inspiring words from local rebels. As Civil Disco-bedience videos enjoy popularity online, Australia’s creative rebellion continues. In Sydney, a group of rebels buried their heads in the sand (brilliant video here) as a demonstration of their government’s denial of the climate and ecological crisis. A swarming team in Adelaide warm up. Hundreds of rebels blocked the William Jolly Bridge in Brisbane for 2 hours, resulting in almost 50 arrests. In Tasmania, 9 rebels were arrested at a roadblock, and XR in Adelaide made some noise at their block party with two rebels arrested. 12 – 13 OCT | Berlin, Germany After three nights, the 400-rebel blockade was finally cleared from outside the Environment Ministry. The site was of course left spotless. The camp hosted a discussion for 6 -13 year-olds on ‘How adults should act’. Elsewhere, the Berlin XR Choir took advantage of the extra weekend shoppers to pipe up in the vast Berlin Mall. Outside art gallery Haus der Kulturen der Welt, a giant wooden whale makes an appearance. While police were laid back when clearing the camp, the 30 rebels who swarmed a motorway slip road a few hours later received far harsher treatment. Officers issued reprimands and took down rebels’ details. Not far away in Tiergarten Park, rebels held a large afternoon assembly to decide how their actions would develop. The weekend was a freakishly hot one for Berlin in October, and while the city’s nomadic rebels enjoyed the sunshine, there was also a sense of foreboding. One only had to look up to see the trails of jet planes criss-crossing the clear blue sky. 10 – 11 OCT | Dublin, Ireland In the small hours of Friday, five rebels locked themselves to the Dail parliament building in protest at their government’s approval of the Shannon LNG deal – a deal that will make the country dependent on imported liquified natural gas for up to 50 years! Rebels formed a blockade around the five lock-ons and it took more than 40 Gardai police and two fire squads to remove them for arrest. Despite the rain, the demonstration was a cheerful and vibrant party that drew in passersby. Thursday morning saw rebels gluing themselves to the Dublin office of the PR firm Red Flag, whose toxic clients include Monsanto. This was followed by a visit to the Minister of Agriculture with the gift of a native tree to oppose the Sitka tree plantations turning Ireland into an ecological dead zone. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Minister refused to meet the rebels. 7-10 OCT | Bratislava, Slovakia On Monday, Slovakian rebels toasted the beginning of the Rebellion at their foodless feast. Rebels explained: ‘We wanted to show that, due to the climate and ecological crisis, we might not have any food left by 2050. So cheers to rebelling – it’s our only hope!’ Rebels blocked the entrance to the Ministry of the Economy, using a swarming technique to protest the Ministry’s refusal to respect the Paris Agreement targets. On Thursday, rebels came together for a spontaneous collective bike lift to celebrate sustainable ways of getting around the city. More of the beautiful and courageous action from the International Rebellion. There is so much to tell. XR Turkey protest outside the Istanbul Biennial, a major contemporary art exhibition with fossil fuel based sponsors. Rebels poured ‘crude oil’ down the front entrance. Police in Brussels react with shocking and disproportionate force to peaceful protest. Rebels in hammocks block the waterways in Amsterdam. A colourful Pride banner brightens up a rainy day in London. To mark Indigenous People’s Day, a grief ceremony was held for the thousands of ancestral bones that lie in the British Museum, taken thousands of miles from their communities and the ground they should be buried under. Rebel Riders caused disruption through the streets of Rome while elsewhere roads were swarmed. The hunger strike by 15 rebels outside the Italian parliament is now in its 7th day. A mighty symbol is projected onto the Eye Cinema in Amsterdam. Educational outreach in Hamra by XR Lebanon on Saturday. Rianka, 21, Student “There’s nothing better I could be doing with my time than protesting to try to save the world. This is the first thing I’ve ever felt truly part of, and that I belong to, and I feel so safe at these events despite all the police presence. I’ve definitely discovered a love for community that I didn’t know I had, and I’ve also discovered an ability to see past people’s views. I’ve bridged more diverse connections than I ever would have if I wasn’t in XR. I’m not down to be arrested. I just think as a woman and as a person of colour… there are just too many risks. My future is already in danger, environmentally, I don’t want to endanger it even more. The police are institutionally racist, they have so many problems. Chanting ‘We love the police’ is putting off so many people of colour from joining XR.” We are receiving amazing human stories and we want to know yours.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/11/rebel-daily-4/,"Day four of the Rebellion saw rebels acting out of love and extraordinary courage. XR New York shut down Time Square with a lime-green boat, UK rebels descended on London City Airport and even climbed onto a plane, and Berlin switched up their tactics to keep disrupting the city. Rebels in Rio and Mexico City performed dynamic, creative expressions of a natural world under threat, and rebel organisers across Colombia are hitting their disruptive stride. With every day that passes, the rebel spirit seems to swell and surge, screaming its refusal to accept an ecocidal system any longer. We are facing a planetary emergency. This is the biggest challenge humanity has ever encountered, a threat to our very existence. To have a chance at surviving, we must give everything we can. Right now, the challenge is to convince people everywhere that this is real and it’s happening right now. When we come together in love for the planet and each other, we are unstoppable. All around the world, people are waking up to their own power and choosing to rebel. Can you imagine how loud we could shout if all of us, every single one, found our voice? The time is NOW for you to choose: extinction or rebellion? _If you’d like to help, please check out our _guide and learn more about XR.

Four days of rebellion, over 1000 arrests (including an ex-police officer and many grandparents), 80 tonnes of equipment confiscated by the police, and still plenty of vegan curry and fire left in rebel bellies! This rebellion is requiring London rebels to be more agile than last time, so they are considering their next move carefully (stay tuned on the broadcast channel). Police continue to reach new lows to break our resolve: this time a rebel in an electric wheelchair had his power pack confiscated. Repeated cases of treatment like this has prompted a formal legal complaint from the charity Plan B. Despite the police’s very best efforts, spirits were high during an impromptu march, 1000 strong, from St James’ Park to a new safe place for tired rebels to lay their heads. Paralympian James Brown sits atop a plane, as part of London City Airport disruptions The biggest story of the day was not in Westminster, but in London City Airport where brave souls disrupted with glue-ons and lock-ons, with one rebel boarding a flight and disrupting with the truth on the emergency, and Paralympian James Brown actually climbing on top of a British Airways plane.

New Yorker rebels swarmed the boat as soon as it moored, attaching themselves to the bow like barnacles using chains and super glue. Atop the vessel, superglued by the feet and handcuffed to the mast, was 16-year-old Nathaniel Walcott. The NYPD were forced to close off the entire square for over two hours and 62 fearless rebels were arrested. To pull off the audacious blockade, a decoy protest was launched at the nearby ‘Fox News’ headquarters. 100 rebels, buoyed by the freshly-formed XR NYC band, arrived at the news tower just as the boat dropped anchor over in Times Square. As night fell, Arrestee Support were waiting outside the local jail with vegan curry and hot tea for the released rebels. 10 OCT | Berlin, Germany Thursday saw new tactics being used in Berlin, with the focus moving from large actions to small and spontaneous swarms all across the city – the #PlanBee. There were glue-ons at the German Ministry for the Environment and at the entrance of the CDU party headquarters. Here, the swarming tactics proved their effectiveness, as police attempts to close off the area failed, and 150 singing and chanting rebels reached their goal. 300 rebels marched from Kreuzberg and their blockade of the super-busy Kottbusser Tor was still going strong by early evening. There was a human chain outside the Bundestag and numerous other swarms of #PlanBees across the main districts, including 200 rebels outside the Ministry of Transport. Rebels embarked on an epic hike from Weissensee to Hermannplatz in Kreuzberg, spreading the word as they went. Meanwhile at the Natural History Museum, 100 rebels demanded a future where wildlife can still be found outside of museum exhibits. While the blockade on the Jannowitzbrücke Bridge was eventually cleared peacefully, rebels at the Marschallbrücke Bridge near the Reichstag are still going strong. 7 – 11 OCT | Vienna, Austria Around 150 earth protectors peacefully occupied the Platz der Menschenrechte (“Place of Human Rights”) in Vienna on Monday, blockading a main city centre thoroughfare. Several Austrian rebels superglued themselves to a 3-meter disc depicting a bleeding Earth. Police began removing rebels with unusual respect and restraint after about three hours. 70 rebels were arrested. On Wednesday, 250 rebels transformed Vienna’s Saltzor bridge into an urban garden. They installed wooden clocks symbolically showing 12:05, while rebels dressed as endangered animal species entertained the crowd with a dance-performance. Two rebels abseiled from the bridge, prompting the arrival of a police-boat. It took five hours for the police to remove the rebels from the bridge. 10 OCT | Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Rebels in Rio staged an ocean-themed action yesterday. An oily rebel with plastic straws glued to her legs lay on a blue tarpaulin decorated with sea-life. The action draws attention to controversy surrounding the auction of oil ‘blocks’ near the Abrolhos Archipelago, a group of islands surrounded by coral reefs off the Southern coast of Brazil’s Bahia state. Campaigners claim a lack of environmental studies of the region, which has the largest biodiversity in the South Atlantic and includes whale migration routes. Brazil’s Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) warns of possible ‘physical, biological and socio-environmental’ impacts that could affect the entire area, including the reef complex. Perhaps appropriately, the region’s name ‘Abrolho’ is Portuguese for “Open your eyes”. 10 OCT | Mexico City, Mexico Mexico City was treated to a carnival-style march yesterday, with scores of rebels carrying XR flags and banners declaring the climate emergency and biodiversity loss already upon us. Many were dressed in fantastical costumes, including leering demons accosting beleaguered winged animals. The procession stopped at a busy intersection, were passers-by were entertained with a theatrical dance performance involving a ‘Mother Earth’ figure facing off against numerous demons passing round a miniature inflatable Earth. Some of the crowd even joined in with the dancing and all involved seemed in good spirits, whether demons, creatures of nature, or curious pedestrian onlookers. 10 OCT | Madrid. Spain Encouraging news from Madrid! Members of XR Spain met with Teresa Ribera, Minister of Energy Transition and Environment, to present their five demands, after a week of peaceful protest outside the Ministry’s doors. Rebels announced that they will continue to monitor the government’s action (or rather in-action!) to stop climate change and will intensify protests until all demands have been met. In other news, six rebels all in white chained themselves to the rails of Retiro Park and sent the keys to the Ayuntamiento (town hall) to show that it is the responsibility of our leaders to come to our aid in these times of global crisis.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/10/rebel-daily-3/,"Empathy begins at home. Many of those reading this will, in the past days and months, have fought, grafted and struggled to build spaces where human beings can come together, support one another in a shared sense of loving grief. Grief for the damage we see all around us; grief for the future we fear for our children or ourselves. For many, it’s only by means of this hard-won togetherness that our eyes can be opened to another harsh truth: that the emergency is not a future prospect, but is in fact a fact of life for countless people and communities around the world, and has been for decades. With their own conditions stable for now, XR communities in Paris and London joined in a wave of solidarity for fallen Earth Defenders: those for whom standing up for life and for the natural world has meant death. The idea of this supportive wave came from XR Argentina, but was taken up as far away as Dublin, Cape Town and Islamabad. Empathy begins at home – but it doesn’t end there. It takes us beyond borders, beyond divisions, to a greater understanding of the immensity of what’s at stake. We must follow it: it’s only with a global, collective moment of awakening that we can hope to face this crisis. If you’d like to help, please check out our guide and learn more about XR.

Anything you can give is appreciated. 9 OCT | Buenos Aires, Santiago, Islamabad, Dublin, Cape Town, London Last year, 164 activists were killed in the Global South for trying to defend their lands from corporate extractivism. Yesterday, rebels all over the world held vigils to honour them, coming together in a global solidarity action. In Buenos Aires, a large group walked to the UN building, each member dressed in black, holding a candle, and carrying a sign bearing the name of one of the 164 murdered activists. They read out a statement and knelt on the pavement to write the names of the fallen activists on the ground in chalk. In Santiago, rebels took part in a solemn procession which brought them to the main historical square Plaza de Armas. They held a vigil to commemorate the 164, first by speaking out every name in turn and then by observing a minute’s silence in which to contemplate the incredible sacrifice that had been made. In Islamabad, rebels silently constructed a gallows outside the National Press Club and staged the hanging of two rebels who stood precariously on blocks of ice. Behind them stood a large sign listing the names of the 164. In Dublin, rebels knelt outside the main gates of the Coal Marketing Company with their hands covered in fake blood. CMC has coordinated the sale and delivery of over 450 million tonnes of coal from Cerrejón, a vast open-pit coal mine in Colombia. In Cape Town, a solemn street vigil was held where rebels listened to speeches and stood to remember those who gave their lives. In London, 164 rebels held a procession ending in a die-in at Trafalgar Square, the name-bearing signs resting on their bodies. The figure of 164 deaths is only an estimate. The real figure is likely to be much higher. Two indigenous activists are murdered every week for defending their lands from Western extractivist corporations, and their names are rarely known widely around the world. Today at least, the fallen defenders were remembered all around the planet they fought to save. 9 OCT | Berlin, Germany Day three of Berlin’s Rebellion saw an old blockade fall but many new ones spring up to take its place. The Big Star roundabout blockade, XR Berlin’s longest standing act of disruption, was finally cleared out yesterday. Rebels made sure to leave the area spotless, with only defiant chalk graffiti remaining as the traffic returned after a 58-hour break. But by the early hours of the morning, 300 rebels had already blocked the Marschallbrücke bridge beside the Reichstag, locking onto a giant wooden life raft. And to the East, a serious blockade had begun on the four-lane Mühlendammbrücke bridge. 1,500 rebels turned up just in time for the rush-hour traffic. It took until the afternoon for the police to clear what was a particularly high-energy yet peaceful demonstration. Not content with blockading two major bridges, rebels set upon taking two more, and traffic in the city centre was brought to a near standstill. There was also a die-in outside the Chancellery, Angela Merkel’s office, for good measure. To top off a big day, XR Youth blockaded a major junction in the busy shopping zone of Kurfurstendamm, demanding an end to business-as-usual and rampant consumerism. For the many shoppers passing through, the message will have been hard to miss. In a grim metaphor for the ongoing extermination and extinction of so much of our planet’s natural life, the police are picking rebels off the street with steady assurance – 92 year-olds and Pink Octopi alike have been removed. Authorities act in accordance with laws designed not to protect the wellbeing of citizens, but to uphold power and protect an insatiable growth-based status quo. Arrests in this rebellion (over 600 and counting) were very much expected. More of a shock is the police tactic of forcefully confiscating shelter, food and water, and anything that might allow disabled people to conveniently participate. In its eagerness to drown out our message of bad news, the government seems happy to give up its duty of care, and in doing so threaten the paramount right to protest. Despite this treatment, rebels have risen magnificently to the occasion and continue to show profound resilience and courage. Day 3 saw a litany of creative, democratic, informed, inclusive and visionary outpourings of the rebellious spirit: mothers nursed their infants, Youth and Elders came together for a theatrical ‘die in’, Gail Bradbrook and Geroge Monbiot spoke, and we have big plans for City Airport today. The PM’s dad is certainly impressed, and Benedict Cumberbatch joined us for the night. But most significantly, over 400 MPs came to collect a young tree to plant from us. ‘[Extinction Rebellion] has changed the conversation’, claims Ed Miliband. And we’re going to keep changing it. Whatever it takes. Please come along to our unifying march on Saturday as we gather to express our grief for the loss of life on our planet. Beginning in St James Park at 1.30pm and ending in Russell Square. For a fuller update with news from all the sites, read more here.

Rebels from the Place de Chatelet tried to tickle the police and expand their area onto the busy Rue de Rivoli, block the private spaces of a nearby McDonalds and Louis Vuitton shop – but nothing prompted a police response. Beyond actions, the day was one of reflection and horizon-expanding. We had a visit from two indigenous activists from Cauca in Colombia, María and Samuel. They thanked French rebels for joining the struggle for Mother Nature and encouraged them to continue, but reminded us that their activist struggle back home is not only for Nature but for their communities and lives. According to Samuel, in the past month, 47 indigenous representatives or guards have been killed in the Cauca region alone. Every day there is a rebellion, and the question of life or death is an ever-present concern. Our day ended with a tribute and silent procession. The environmental revolution will be built on solidarity and intercultural bonds, or it will not be built at all. For more from XR France, check out their wonderful Gazette. 6- 8 OCT | Santiago, Chile Rebels in Santiago have been standing up and lying down in defense of the planet. Chilean rebels held a family friendly die-in at Persa Bío Bío, a blockade at Alameda Av., one of the busiest streets of the city, and a protest against the fast fashion industry in Costanera Centre Mall. On Saturday 12th, there will be a march on “El día del Encuentro de Dos Mundos” [Two Worlds Meeting), the remembrance day of Christopher Columbus arriving in America in 1492. Rebels will be there to ensure that the accompanying legacy of colonialism, genocide and ecocide is not forgotten. 9 OCT | Cape Town, South Africa XR Cape Town and XR Winelands took non-violent direct action yesterday against the ‘Africa Oil and Power’ conference. The die-in performance involved rebels suffocating in vibrant clouds of ‘toxic’ gas, and was staged to draw attention to the crimes against humanity and the ecocide that the conference is facilitating. On its website the conference boasts of being a “platform” for countries across Africa to present oil exploration and other fossil fuel projects and “get deals signed”. No mention is made of the suffering stored up for the world’s most vulnerable with each new project undertaken. These omissions are especially conspicuous given the susceptibility of sub-Saharan Africa to climate breakdown, a topic that South Africa’s government and media has resolutely failed to tackle. This is still a landscape where new gas finds are celebrated and talk of ‘clean coal’ is left unquestioned. The IPCC report, published on 8th October 2018, was supposed to mark a ‘line in the sand’ on climate action. A year later, XR Quebec organized a birthday party on a busy intersection in the heart of downtown to highlight how government inaction had crossed that very line. And what a party it was! 200 people came together for a celebration of life and rebellion, with vegan cake, XR birthday hats and live music! But the symbolism didn’t end there: the original report was brought together by 40 countries, and it happened that 40 rebels were arrested because they refused to end the party when told. The arrestable support team didn’t miss a beat, providing pillows, legal advice and healthy snacks to the brave rebels! At least 148 rebels have been arrested in Australia since the start of the Spring Rebellion. 48 XR groups are taking part in non-violent direct action across the country. Rebels are committed to disrupt until their government listens and acts! In Melbourne, rebels held a silent vigil on the steps of state parliament before marching through the city, blocking Flinders Street, before being forcibly removed by police. On Wednesday, a civil DISCO-Bedience took place with rebels of all ages getting funky. On Wednesday, Tasmania ramped up actions with a Funeral for Life in Nipaluna / Hobart to represent the generations that won’t exist because of inaction on climate change. In an interview, Elly Baxter mentioned: “The cornerstone of democracy is the right to protest. The government is supposed to report to us, the people. At the moment, they’re reporting to fossil fuel companies, and vested interests. And it’s not good enough”. See more of the beautiful and courageous action from the International Rebellion in XR Unchained. There is so much to tell. ‘We need workers eventually to take industrial strike action, that’s why there’s XR trades unionists meeting here on the 12th October. That will be the next big step, when ordinary organised workers actually take on board the slogan ‘A living wage on a liveable planet’. I’m not an Arrestable today because I am a person of colour, and I have a bit of an antagonistic relationship with the police. I’d loath to do a nice chit-chat with the Police, I’ll leave that to the white rebels who are backing me. It’s fantastic that here in London they’ve got climate refugees from the global south at the centre of their arguments, because it is people of colour that are impacted adversely.’ We are receiving amazing human stories and we want to know yours.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/09/rebel-daily-2/,"The seeds have been sewn. Compassion; awareness; courage. They landed in cities, suburbs and farmland; in hearts and in minds, taking no account of age or occupation or background. And now we’re growing: taking root. In some cities we’re established on the roads and growing stronger by the day. Tents are assembled, flags are dangled, kitchens put together. In other places we’re meeting, painting, blocking: making our mark in other ways. Rebel campers make it through the first night of Rebellion. But the deeper growth is not a thing which can be touched. It comes in the form of newly-made communities coming together to dance, sing, laugh and cry. In creativity, diligence and generosity combining into miraculous works of art. In love. And in a rebellion – strong enough to fight and win against an ecocidal status quo. The forces of ‘law and order’ will oppose us in the coming days. Their representatives will hassle us and threaten us and maybe even hurt us. The media establishment will slander, ignore and misconstrue us. These things won’t stop us; won’t even slow us. If we won’t be heard, we’ll shout and sing our message louder. If disruption doesn’t stop the system, we’ll simply have to do it bigger and do it better. We’re putting down roots – and no government can take them out.

Action Highlights XR Unchained *Announcements 8 OCT | Westminster After Monday’s exhilaration, rebels have been pushing down roots and getting used to life in the capital. As we found in April, there comes a point at which it seems almost natural that we would be here in the roads. Natural, but also nicer: instead of car engines, choirs and samba bands; instead of throngs of busy strangers, free food and open dialogue (not least from incorrigible truth-teller Jonathan Pie!) Many trees were planted in Westminster today Not everyone seems to agree with the improvement. The arrest count continues to climb – already at a staggering 550 – and it’s partly due to police pressure that several of our sites have merged together for greater cohesion. Despite all this, the police response has yet to really follow through on the earlier tough talk. The seriously questionable tactic of disrupting our infrastructure hasn’t yet managed to stop a gradual blossoming of gazebos (largely just in time for this afternoon’s biblical downpour!), kitchens and tents in various sites. And we’re just getting started – this team can’t wait to see what happens when heroic rebels (including you?) occupy City Airport on Thursday. To join this action you’ll need to make a briefing beforehand, so waste no time in signing up! For a fuller update with news from all the sites, click this button: London rebels, check out our Rebellion Needs for practical ways you can help rebels on the ground right now. For a summary of today’s media response, see this briefing. 8 OCT | Place de Chatelet The occupation at the Place de Chatelet continues and thrives. To the surprise of French rebels, no arrests or police force has yet been used to clear the crucial intersection of the capital. Among strategic and logistical questions, general assemblies at the site guess at why this might be: to avoid a repeat of the backlash to their last repression? To split the environmental movement from the Yellow Vests? Nobody knows. At nightfall, the site holds a giant General Assembly to organise logistics In the meantime, the party is more alive than ever and rebels enjoy this calme avant la tempête to organise, hang a banner as high as the statue of the place de Chatelet can go, hold free classes on climate change by experts, and hold debates on solutions to combat our climate and ecological crisis. And, of course, Parisians gather to dance. Heavy rain during the day did not stop the dancing! But perhaps the most ‘Parisian’ exploit of the rebels is the splendid Gazette d’Extinction Rebellion which appears almost four centuries after the first newspaper, the Gazette de France, was founded there in 1631. Of course, the XR Gazette transforms the original royalist paper into a revolutionary call for love, fraternity, and consideration for nature. Its horoscope and its tone – satirical and light-hearted – revives rebels’ spirits and conversations at the end of the day, and the beautifully designed paper is enthusiastically distributed and shared around campsite. For a condensed English version of yesterday’s Gazette, click here ; for those of you lucky enough to understand the tongue of Molière, you can find the original first issue here. 8 OCT | Berlin, Germany With the start of Rebellion, XR Germany successfully blocked two key parts of Berlin – the Big Star roundabout by the Siegessäule and a major junction at Potsdamer Platz. At Potsdamer Platz, the police began clearing out rebels at dawn and, with the help of the fire brigade, even the lock-ons didn’t last long. The rebels split up and began a series of smaller actions across the city, including a blockade at the headquarters of the CDU political party and a funeral march with a symbolic burial of Mother Earth. Rebels at the Big Star roundabout were still going strong with the help of space blankets and thermos flasks. By late morning, giant tarps had been erected to protect them from the rain. The roundabout was suddenly a tented village, and the first lock-ons were in place by noon. Police in the area started to multiply, and with nearly one police officer for every two protestors, the order soon came to clear out. Some rebels were carried away and left in puddles, while others had pain compliance techniques used against them. But the lock-ons remained in place, and while some single-lane traffic was able to flow again, the police could only partially clear the junction. The blockade lived on, the police withdrew, and not a single rebel had been arrested! By sunset, XR Germany was celebrating 40 hours of continuous, peaceful protest for this greatest of all causes. 7 & 8 Oct | Dublin, Ireland The last few days have been a difficult time for XR Ireland. In response to the Irish government pushing ahead with plans to build a U.S. fracked gas terminal in Shannon, rebels decided to add a demand for Rebellion Week: Stop the Shannon LNG Terminal plus any new fossil fuel infrastructure! Rebels kicked off the week with a symbolic funeral of the Earth, a samba parade with a pink ‘Tell the Truth’ boat, a planting of seeds, and some passionate speeches. The civil guards (police) allowed rebels to camp in one of the city’s central parks and the first day passed in a peaceful, family-friendly atmosphere. There was a spontaneous sit-in at the gates of the Dail (Ireland’s Parliament) that meant some politicians were locked in. XR Ireland decided to deliver their message to their political representatives: “We have had enough”. The rebels refused to move and chanted “We do it for your children’s future too”. The civil guards removed rebels, but made no arrests, and even thanked the protestors for their peaceful presence. 8 OCT | Jacques Cartier Bridge, Montreal Three Quebecois rebels closed all five lanes of traffic on the busiest bridge in Montreal for over an hour. At rush hour. Two women and a man scaled the huge metal structure in the middle of the night, forcing police to close the bridge to traffic. Sadly, the brave rebels were stopped before they could drop their 20m wide banner and were arrested once back on the ground. A video of one rebel explaining the action has gone viral: ‘We are not the farfelus (crazy ones). Those who believe we can keep growing forever in a finite world are the ones who live in a fantasy land.’ XR NYC’s ocean-themed boat A group of over 40 rebels joined Brother Fulfillment from Thich Nhat Hanh’s Plum Village in a meditative action calling on the government to Act Now. They blocked the entrance to City Hall by staging a seated meditation, a peaceful act of resistance rooted in historic acts of civil disobedience. The beautiful mascot boat, “Vaquita,” traveled through New York City, spreading the news of the Rebellion. Featuring images of the nearly extinct porpoise for which she is named and large Extinction symbol flags, her crew handed out flyers about the rebellion and talked to passersby stopped in traffic. They declared their voyage a success and look forward to getting her back out in the city soon. 8 OCT | Rome, Italy 15 rebels started a hunger strike in front of Parliament in Rome to raise awareness of the threat to food insecurity caused by the crisis. Michael Stipe, of alt rock band R.E.M. fame, boosted morale in XR Rome by adding his voice to the chorus of rebels: “I want my voice to be part of this change of consciousness. I believe we can start the change needed to improve our wonderful planet, our position and our place on earth!” This came the day after**a heartfelt performance in Piazza Venezia**in front of the famous landmark “colonna Traiana”, titled the blood of our children. Rebels held hands as red “blood” was poured onto their exposed skin and was then wiped clean gently. 7 OCT | Syntagma Square, Athens, Greece Greek rebels joined other climate emergency protestors to stage a die-in against fracking on the steps of Parliament. Earlier this month, the Greek government voted to allow the oil companies Total, ExxonMobil, Edison, Energean and Hellenic Petroleum, to extract oil and gas in sea beds around the country. Greek Rebels demanded that their government repeal these concessions to the oil companies and tell the truth about the disastrous effects of oil exploitation on ecosystems, biodiversity, the local economy and public health. 6 OCT | Columbo, Sri Lanka XR Sri Lanka writes… Sunday was our first rebellion. The Climate Emergency is ignored and not acted upon in our country, but there is a fast-growing movement of people who are beginning to join forces and bring about societal change. Our original plan was to have an official Declaration of Climate Emergency, followed by a die-in, yoga training for “spiritual warriors”, music gathering with unplugged instruments, and putting up posters with QR codes that link to websites proposing solutions for change. However, the weather decided otherwise. Torrential rain poured down throughout the day and we’re so proud of all the rebels who showed up regardless. Despite an initial pledge to not use disruption, the group decided to walk through the rain and partially obstruct traffic in order to be more visible. The action got decent media coverage, and we all felt empowered with a hope that we will indeed make a change! Sri Lankan rebels are now planning to assist local environmental causes while striking and spreading awareness at the same time! Our next action on Saturday will be an official Declaration and a mass die-in followed by a beach clean-up. See more beautiful and courageous action from the International Rebellion in XR Unchained. There is so much to tell. ARGENTINA – Around 30 rebels wearing boiler suits joined the Red Brigade for a dramatic action in the offices of Bayer and Monsanto. They played haunting music while holding black and white photos of victims of the climate crisis. COLOMBIA – Rebels projected a truth-telling video on the side of the environment ministry in the Colombian capital Bogotá. Rebels drew attention to their government’s criminal inaction in the face of climate disaster, despite their president’s insistence that Colombia is “not part of the climate problem”.

https://rebellion.global/blog/2019/10/08/rebel-daily-1/,"October 08, 2019 by Extinction Rebellion International Rebellion is here. And it's bigger and more beautiful than we dared to imagine. This is what mass civil disobedience looks like. It's happening. It can't be ignored. It's only growing stronger. It's a rebellion. We're back on the roads -- with as much joy, fear, love and courage as ever. We're shutting down cities -- not because it's fun (though it can be), but because it's our last option for stopping this toxic system in its tracks. Our world is dying; to save it, we'll need everyone -- wherever and whoever you are -- to do your bit. And though we're still somewhat short of the shared, global consciousness we need, we're getting ever closer. This International Rebellion which began on Monday is so vast it's almost impossible to take it all in. Thousands of people flood 60 cities across the globe, with over 700 brave rebels arrested as they stand up for their right to life, and that's just the start. It's not just a question of quantity. With every season that passes, we grow more organised, more unified, more creative, more courageous. Just look at the 11 vibrant sites held around the centre of London, the choir of Amsterdam rebels, the blood poured on the bull statue in Wall Street in New York, the ambition of our banner-hangers, the Red Brigade arriving in Tel Aviv and Istanbul, underwater protest art in Mexico, the boats of every shape and size that we are so desperately trying to keep afloat. We're a movement unlike any other. This newsletter team will do everything we can to keep up and to showcase the unreal brilliance of our young movement. We can only apologise in advance for not capturing every aspect of this glorious, unfathomably complex process that is our rebellion. We hope that wherever this reaches you -- whether you're superglued to a road, camping out in the rain, deep in spreadsheets and planning, or at home drinking your coffee -- you will be touched by what is going on right now all over the world. We hope you understand that it's for you, and for every human being alive and not yet alive. You are not alone in this beautiful mess. And it's not too late to join in. If you'd like to help, please check out our guide and learn more about XR. To connect to rebels in your local area, get in touch with your nearest XR group.

Support the Rebellion 7 OCT | London, UK ""How we have grown"" --- The Red Rebel Brigade, London Over 275 rebels have been arrested on a momentous day which marks the beginning of XR's October Rebellion in London. Early on Monday morning, rebels from all over the country mobilised and successfully took 11 main sites around Westminster in central London, including two key bridges. Rebels drove a hearse into the 'Burning Earth' site in Trafalgar Square, parked it, and locked and glued themselves to the vehicle. The 'undertaker' in the drivers' seat D-locked his own neck to the steering wheel. Footage broadcast on ITV News shows police officers desperately trying to prevent more rebels gluing themselves underneath the vehicle, as well as a deeply moving moment where a father locked onto the underside of the hearse reveals why he is taking this drastic measure. In the back of the hearse, rebels had mounted a coffin painted with the words 'OUR FUTURE'. Meanwhile, a tower of scaffolding was positioned in the road, which rebels climbed and glued onto. They held this for most of the day, before being lifted off in orange sacks by police officers kitted out in climbing gear. Latest videos show rebels still going strong, including those attached to and inside the hearse. In an exciting turn of events, a rebel wedding was held in the middle of the blocked Westminster Bridge (a first for the bridge, as far as we know!) to the sound of XR cheers and a feisty brass band. Love was truly in the air. Also seen on the bridge were yoga enthusiasts, a ceilidh with bagpipes, and, floating beneath the bridge, an XR boat headed for the Houses of Parliament. XR filled the road outside Downing Street, blockaded Westminster Bridge nearby, and a stream of tents and campers continued from there all the way to Lambeth Bridge. Despite the efforts of peacefully protesting rebels in London today, pre-planned and persistent police confiscations have left blockades lacking infrastructure and amenities. However, officers failed to confiscate the rebel spirit, which lives on in furious love and determination. The Rebellion is alive and well. Join us in London! For a fuller update with news from all the sites, click this button: More London Site News! London rebels, check out our Rebellion Needs for practical ways you can help rebels on the ground right now. Priorities are furniture for blockades and hot water and ready-to-eat vegan food for the campers! 7 OCT | 15:00 onwards | Place de Chatelet, Paris, France XR France managed to block and occupy Paris' most central and busiest intersection, near the Nôtre-Dame cathedral. Rebels, aware of the sensitivity of the site, kept the location secret until the last minute and attached themselves to flower planters to complicate police efforts to remove them. Rebels reminiscent of the now symbolic pink boat Berta Cáceres that reigned over London's Oxford Circus during the last international rebellion can be reassured -- its blue brother has crossed the channel for this October and cast its anchor in Parisian waters. As we are ""all in the same boat"", its DJs and dancers are inviting passers-by to join this festive occupation in all of its creativity, and keep the troops energized and regenerated for a lasting rebellion. 7 OCT | Berlin, Germany Our uprising begins. From early morning, 1000 rebels blocked the ""Big Star"" roundabout surrounding Berlin's Siegessäule as well as a key junction at Potsdamer Platz. As the sun rose, peaceful rebels danced and sang. Our ship, the Arche Rebella, has been put together once again in a new location. ""Captain"" Carola Rackete stated the simple truth: ""The situation is more than severe: ecosystems and species are threatened by the climate catastrophe and the actions of mankind. The planet and its natural resources are our basis of life -- if it is not in balance, the consequences will be catastrophic for the planet and for all of humanity."" Berlin rebellion takes to the air! 3000 rebels held Potsdamer Platz -- with the help of lots of potted plants and a Red Rebel Brigade -- and the site was buzzing. Rebels continued to hold the Platz for longer than expected, with some chaining themselves together. Even as police threatened rebels with physical violence if they failed to clear the blockade, our mood could not be beaten! We were dancing, singing and sending out a strong signal about the climate crisis. It was early evening before police were able to begin slowly clearing rebels. Two thousand rebels remained and the good mood continued as food was shared, even as police began confiscating our equipment. 7 OCT | Madrid, Spain Madrid rebels had a dramatic first day of Rebellion! 300 rebels surrounded a pink boat to block a bridge and were greeted by an alarming police response that included twisting arms, pressing thumbs into rebels' eyes and putting pressure under their jaws. 10 rebels were hospitalised and many others suffered minor injuries. There were 43 arrests that day in Madrid. But their spirits were not broken. The rebels went onto cause further disruption and set up camp in front of Spain's Ministry of Ecological Transition. Rebels dressed in red, blue and brown -- representing forest fires, rising sea levels and desertification -- stalked others dressed in animal costumes in a striking performance about mass extinction. Read the full story here. 7 OCT | Amsterdam, The Netherlands Amsterdam rebelled against a ban imposed by the mayor and policeand brought non-violent direct action to the heart of the city. In the early hours, eager rebels gathered to block off roads in front of the city's famous museums. In addition to beautiful paintings by Vermeer and Van Gogh, tourists viewed a modern day decor of brave earth-protectors fighting for their democracy and freedom of speech. The site then toured around the Heineken Experience to make sure any tourists there didn't miss out. In a miscalculated response, the police blocked off the first protest site, playing into our rebels' hands, who staged an impromptu die-in on the Dam square instead. The protests ended in over 100 arrests with rebels responding to police aggression by collectively chanting 'We are peaceful, what are you?' Four large city buses transported the arrestees away. Cries of peaceful resistance and tunes from the busses echoed far and wide through the capital's narrow streets and over the canals. The first reports ofsmiley rebels released from custody are already in! After a good night's sleep in the newly established rebel town in front of the Rijksmusuem, Dutch rebels will bring back the action tomorrow with a gathering at the Vondelpark. ** 7 OCT | New York, USA** Around 90 New Yorker rebels were arrested yesterday after they launched a wave of actions in the city's famous financial district. Protesters poured fake blood over Wall Street's iconic Bull statue, held a very bloody die-in outside the New York stock exchange, and then blocked a nearby road. The die-in was attended by the stunning Red Brigade, and featured a New Orleans funeral band that got the hundreds of rebellious mourners dancing in the streets. Tombstones mentioning hurricanes and fires made worse by the climate crisis were held aloft, along with a coffin with the words ""Our future"" written on the side. Once the fun was over, rebels clean-up crews stepped in to mop the fake blood away. Police set up a perimeter and arrested rebels in waves. Despite the high arrest count, the sunkissed rebellion base in nearby Washington Square park was buzzing. Actions will be continuing here over the coming days, and are expected to spread to Chicago and Washington DC later in the week. For more details on what the rebels of New York are up to, check out their own daily updates. 7 OCT | Toronto, Canada XR Toronto gathered at Playter Gardens in the city's east end for a day of October Rebellion. After an early morning debriefing, protesters took to the Bloor Viaduct with banners, signs, and megaphones, numbers bolstered by other groups and allies. There, they cordoned off the bridge and nearby Danforth Avenue from rush hour traffic, allowing the space to play host to a multitude of activities. In addition to activist speeches and performances, the group participated in singing, meditation and yoga sessions while other protestors chalked key messages along the concrete. Looming over the action were Extinction Rebellion banners and messages, draped across the Viaduct walls, and the organization's iconic hourglass logo set at an impressive height. As the morning wore on, police announced a request for dispersal, yet several rebels remained. This group sat or stood in front of large, red and yellow ""Act Now"" block letters while the rest of the protesters swelled to either side of Danforth Avenue with songs of peace and hope. Arrestees -- all nonviolent -- were eventually taken into police cars and driven off; the remaining group returned to Playter Gardens for camaraderie and regeneration. Toronto's action upon the Viaduct reached a wide audience of receptive hearts. Hard work is ahead but another river has undoubtedly been crossed. With actions from Halifax to Victoria, today marked a new chapter of XR's fight for climate justice in Canada. 7 OCT | Melbourne, Australia The day began with a sacred ceremony on the steps of Parliament House, when rebels, still waking up, took gum leaves and received the welcome via smoke cleansing before moving back to the central campsite of Carlton Gardens. Inside the gardens there were family events, talks, training sessions and a choir. A massive Declaration of Rebellion was made against the criminal inaction of the world's governments on the climate and ecological emergency. Upwards of a thousand people came together at 16:00 for a march through the CBD (Central Business District), which was successfully disrupted from 16:00 -- 19:00, in a colourful, energetic, peaceful, respectful action. Some carried a glass coffin, like a fish tank, filled with aquatic plants and rocks to illustrate concern for about the impact of climate change on oceans. The plan was to march through the city creating swarms in key intersections as a taste of actions that will follow for the entire week. The police had a strong presence, including mounted officers. At least 10 rebels were arrested, sacrificing their liberty to draw attention to the climate emergency and the need to act. Extinction Rebellion Victoria acknowledges that Camp Carlton and the Spring Rebellion take place on the stolen land of the Boon Wurrung and Woiwurrung (Wurundjeri) peoples of the Kulin Nation. Sovereignty was never ceded. Read more about the beautiful and courageous action from the International Rebellion in XR Unchained. There is so much to tell. Excitingly, XR India and Sri Lanka held their first ever XR actions on the 6th -- rebels acted with incredible heart and courage even amidst possible police interference. Meanwhile in New Zealand, rebels blockaded a crucial street outside the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment with the iconic pink boat. In Latin America, rebels turned out in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico to call for immediate action from their governments. Brazilian rebels held a die-in on Copacabana beach and XR Argentina held three different rebellious actions in Buenos Aires. Europe truly outdid itself this time, with creative actions happening all over, including Athens, Vienna, Rome, Istanbul, and Moldova (to name but a few). Across the globe, rebels took to the streets with love and rage to call upon their governments and politicians to #ActNow to mitigate the climate and ecological crisis. International Rebellion will continue with even more brilliant events in the coming weeks. Blood runs over Italian rebels in front of Montecitorio Palace, Rome. Everyone puts their oar in to help block this intersection in Wellington, New Zealand. 45 were arrested on the first day. Rebels in Los Cabos, Mexico, perform underwater in a stunning piece about modern life called 'The vanity, the distraction, the blindness' In Vienna, rebels turned out in their hundreds to peacefully disrupt the city. 70 rebels were arrested. Argentine rebels proudly hung a banner off this lovely tower in Retiro, Buenos Aires Sri Lankan rebels braving the torrential rain to launch their first ever XR action We know that many of our readers who are unable to participate directly in one of our big actions are still really keen to get involved.

https://rebellion.global/press/2021/04/14/xr-nyc-rebel-injured/,"On April 2, 2021, members of Extinction Rebellion took part in civil disobedience outside multiple banks in NYC, including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, TD Bank and Citibank. The action was part of Global Money Rebellion [1], a sustained campaign to expose the financial industry’s complicity in the climate & ecological emergency. [2] Around the world, in New York, Paris, Brussels, [3] London, [4] and Rome, activists called out the culpability of the banking sector [5] for the climate and ecological devastation they directly cause with their funding of destructive industries. Details here ---- JP Morgan Chase, the world’s largest funder of fossil fuels, has issued green initiatives as part of a ""net zero"" strategy that pales in comparison to its direct financing of the fossil fuel industry. Chase is also part of a syndicate of banks financing Line 3—a deadly tar sands pipeline being constructed through Anishinaabe land along with TD Bank, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Every day, banks continue to facilitate the destruction and devastation of our land, water, and food systems. Since 2015, the world’s 60 largest commercial and investment banks have poured $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels (not to mention the billions they also invest in deforestation and other ecocidal industries). The action was in solidarity with the Water Protectors of Minnesota. Extinction Rebellion activists sprayed graffiti and hung banners on the property of banks that fund Line 3. If completed, Line 3 would endanger waterways, destroy natural habitats, and arable land that have supported the Anishinaabe people for millennia. Line 3 would contribute as much damage to our climate as 50 new coal burning power plants. Holley White, Extinction Rebellion activist and former farmer and small business owner, said “(JP Morgan) Chase is greenwashing by duping the American people into believing that they are addressing climate change. Their current lending decisions focus on short term profits but will result in long term perhaps irreversible, damage to the environment. They are committing crimes against humanity and the earth, and need to be held accountable.” During the action, a rebel attempted to scale the side of the JPMorgan Chase Building in Manhattan, to call out the bank for its role in climate and ecological destruction. In a startling turn of events, the climber fell and sustained an injury. He is now in recovery. To support him, donate here. Banks have been facing increasing pressure from the climate movement. As of late, all six major US banks have pledged to end funding for new drilling and exploration projects in the Arctic. JP Morgan Chase, is at a deadlock with its Board’s recent decision to reject conversion to a public benefit corporation. [6] “The slow moving policies to divest from fossil fuels is far from what is needed to avert the worst climate catastrophe” said Jos Vulto, Extinction Rebellion activist and retired artist, “Climate change disproportionately affects poor people in low-income communities and developing countries around the world.” Rebels in Extinction Rebellion regularly make sacrifices and take risks through nonviolent civil disobedience. We do this in the midst of a climate and ecological crisis, the severity of which our government and media choose to ignore and downplay. Many people who take action have been directly affected by the climate emergency, or fear for their lives and their children’s future. Nonviolent civil resistance has been central to positive societal change throughout history. Extinction Rebellion follows in line with non-violent movements including the Suffragettes and the Civil Rights movement to raise awareness and demand the government take the drastic, necessary action to stop further climate and ecological breakdown.

https://rebellion.global/press/2021/01/23/roger-hallam-clarification-statement/,"Roger Hallam, a co-founder of XR UK, has recently made allegations against Global Support and our work, and threatens to embark on a hunger strike in protest. Here are some clarifications on Global Support, our purpose, and our past history with Roger: Global Support does not claim to speak on behalf of the whole XR movement. As stated on the global XR website, GS facilitates the flow of information and resources between groups, offering trainings, funding, and communications support to the movement. Roger says that Global Support claims to speak for the global movement, but it has always been explicitly stated that we are not a ""headquarters"" or global decision-making body for the whole movement — we do not create movement strategy, or determine XR's Demands or Principles & Values, for example. Nowhere in our Statement of Separation does it say that. Many current and past members of Global Support have met with Roger over the past two years. Roger says he has no idea who is in our group, and that he has never met us, but in truth he has engaged with many members of Global Support — from video calls with GS working groups and physical meetings, to maintaining relationships with current and past Global Support rebels — all while fully knowing they were part of Global Support. Global Support has never forbidden local groups from interacting with anyone, and it never will. Roger says that groups have been ""forbidden from interacting"" with him, but not only have we never issued such a ban, it is not within our authority to do so. We affirm every XR group's right to decide whom they engage and interact with. Roger makes the claim we described him as anti-semitic in our Statement of Separation, and yet nowhere in that document is this written. Further, at no point has Global Support ever stated this. In the spirit of Tell the Truth, we ask that readers stick to the facts and remain vigilant against acts of gaslighting and misinformation. We also want to offer clarifications around Roger's past actions in response to his statement against Global Support: Roger has created conflicts and controversies, resulting in — among other things — XR Germany, XR Switzerland, and large numbers of XR groups and rebels in Latin America disassociating from him. These developments did not just play out publicly — Roger also engaged in private mediated discussions with some of these groups, during which he did not offer any meaningful steps toward reconciliation. Roger may publicly state a desire for open, honest mediation, but he has a track record of further exacerbating conflicts, rather than working to resolve them. We are frankly bewildered to hear that Roger plans to embark on a hunger strike in protest of our actions. Hunger strikes are a time-honored, dangerous, and extreme form of civil disobedience, used by Gandhi in his campaign against the British rule of India, UK Suffragettes fighting for the right to vote for women, anti-nuclear weapons campaigners, and others fighting for worthy causes of justice. Roger's plan to hunger strike over a perceived personal affront appropriates and threatens to delegitimatise this honorable tradition. This over-reaction only reinforces our concerns related to Roger's intentions, motives, and ability to work through conflicts regeneratively and without manipulation and toxicity. As a result, we do not feel sufficient trust to enter into a mediated discussion with him. Just as many other groups have distanced from Roger — including XR Germany, XR Switzerland, and XR UK — Global Support chose to exercise its basic right to freedom of association, one we all assert as individuals as we go about our lives. But Global Support is also committed to openness and transparency: we are only ""faceless,"" to use Roger's word, in the sense that we are not a collection of public personalities. Rather, we are a hard working and self-organised entity of around 170 volunteers from all over the world, diverse in race, gender, and background, working tirelessy to fight the Climate and Ecological Emergency. In the course of this work, we meet with rebels daily, all over the world, in video calls, chat and - where possible - in person. However, we recognize this distracting faux-crisis has shown us that we do need to do a better job of telling the XR movement our story. Rebels around the world use tech and media platforms and services, attend trainings, and receive grant funding, often without always being aware that GS is providing these services, or how we are structured and our ways of working. We pledge to do better at this, starting with opening more channels for feedback from XR groups about their needs, and integrating the learnings. Global Support was created to help a beautiful, vast and decentralised movement thrive - a movement in service to the Planet, not would-be 'figureheads' or public personalities. This is where our energy must be spent, with not a minute to waste. We greatly look forward to putting this behind us, such that we can continue to dedicate all our energy where it counts: supporting the Rebels of the world!

https://rebellion.global/press/2020/12/13/cop26-action/,"On December 11th, the eve of the 5th anniversary of the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement, Extinction Rebellion launched ‘COP26: We Are Watching You,’ a series of global synchronised projections drawing attention to the lack of action, missed ambitions and broken promises from world leaders. Over several nights, a video was projected in 14 cities across the globe including Paris, Glasgow, Washington, Buenos Aires, Mumbai and London. The video carried the message: “COP26: We Are Watching You. Don’t Let Us Down.” The groups intend to raise awareness to issues in COP26 every month in the lead up to the Glasgow summit to offer a message of community and courage during these dark times. The message hopes to stress the deeply interconnected humanitarian nature of the crisis, a crisis which will require all countries coming together to find solutions. The project was developed by 20 countries, some of them already deeply affected by climate change. The video focuses on how complex and interconnected issues caused by climate change are disrupting food security, livelihoods and homes around the world. The action aims to highlight the role of COP26 in limiting climate breakdown and compelling governments to take stronger action towards this. Some famous landmarks that displayed the projections include the SEC in Glasgow where COP26 will be held, the Newseum a few blocks from the Capitol in Washington, government and embassy buildings in London, and the Obelisco in Argentina. Cathy Allen from XRCOP stated: “The 25 meetings of COP have so far only achieved the Paris Agreement. Though a start in terms of coming together, the Paris Agreement is not nearly enough to protect humanity. The world is watching as time runs out. Fires, floods, sea level rise, heat waves, drought, food insecurity - all these are happening now. But just around the corner, we can see that much worse is coming. COP26 is a historic opportunity for a just and fair agreement to control climate heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The COP26 process is under global scrutiny.” The aim of the Paris Agreement is (to) ‘strengthen the global response to climate change’ and ‘pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.50C above pre-industrial levels’. However, as Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General outlined on December 2, 2020, global increase in temperature is already 1.20C and rising. ‘In fact emissions are now 62% higher than they were at the start of COP negotiations in 1990…the world needs to decrease fossil fuel production by roughly 6 per cent every year between now and 2030. Instead the world is going in the opposite direction – planning an annual increase of 2 per cent.’ The Glasgow COP26 faces significant challenges as, currently, few countries, and no G20 country, have targets in line with a 1.5OC temperature rise. (https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/) In addition, the $100billion per year promised in the Paris Agreement for climate finance to vulnerable countries, is not being met.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Led by local environmentalists and young climate activists from Rio de Janeiro, the movement to block the building of a new racetrack in the Camboatá Forest, one of the last remnants of original tropical forests in Brazil's most iconic city, is gaining global momentum thanks to support from the British F1 star Lewis Hamilton and several members of youth organizations across the world. It is estimated that the racetrack would lead to the loss of up to 180,000 of the 200,000 trees of the Camboatá Forest. Even if those trees were indeed reforested in other areas, as promised by the authors of the project, studies show that there would be a considerable loss of biodiversity, as well as impacts to the welfare of the local community, situated in a poor area of Rio de Janeiro. From the North American National Hockey League, which has one of the biggest carbon footprints in world sport, to the Dakar Rally, which estimates say will produce over 100 tonnes of waste at its next race, the impact of the global sporting industry on the planet continues to take a devastating toll. “We had FIFA and the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. These cases showed me the way that sporting mega-events, especially in the developing world, can bring with them a toxic mix of corruption, environmental crimes and human rights abuses. The same was true of Russia, with Sochi, South Africa with FIFA and many other cities where such mega events have been held.” said Pedro Cunha, co-creator of the campaign and Extinction Rebellion member. Lewis Hamilton's support for the campaign came on October 8th, when the multiple-times F1 champion declared to journalists: ""I heard it is potentially going to be a sustainable race but the most sustainable thing you can do is not tear down any trees."" He added: ""I don’t think it’s a smart move. There is a global crisis with deforestation."" Right after Lewis Hamilton's remarks, the campaign to save the Camboatá Forest gained even more traction on social media as members of the youth climate movement Fridays for Future in at least 20 countries helped to spread the hashtag #SportsAgainstEcocides. “It would be absolutely shameful and evil if this project that will cut down 180,000 trees pushes through, all for the sake of a racing circuit that will benefit no one. We are in a planetary and climate emergency, ecocide can no longer be part of our plans. This is not only a crime to the environment, but to the people. Every single industry should be doing its part in saving the environment and addressing the climate crisis. I believe that F1 can do better, F1 needs to do better."" said Mitzi Jonelle Tan of Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines Photo: Mitzi Jonelle, Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines This hashtag was created by Extinction Rebellion Brazil and Fridays for Future Rio de Janeiro as a call for individuals and organizations anywhere in the world to join the fight for conservation in Brazil. It is also a way to show global support to the activists resisting the environmentally destructive policies of Bolsonaro's government and of the government of the State of Rio de Janeiro.

https://rebellion.global/press/2020/09/01/global-rebellion/,"Sustained mass civil disobedience gets underway as rebels call for governments worldwide to tell the truth and act now on the accelerating climate and ecological crisis For a calendar of up to date rebellions taking place around the world, see below. XR Sweden kicked off the actions on August 27 with a 3 day rebellion. XR UK then picks up the baton on September 1 with a blockade of the British parliament as politicians return for their first sitting after the summer. UK Rebels will carry out actions to put increasing pressure on MPs to back the Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill and agree to create a National Citizens’ Assembly that empowers people to make fair and democratic decisions on how to respond to the climate emergency. Actions then roll on throughout September and October across Europe, the US, South America, Australia and beyond. Rebels will come together in their home countries to take a stand against unacceptable government inaction in the face of a rapidly closing window to avert catastrophic climate change and ecological and social collapse. It is estimated that some 250,000 people in more than 1,000 groups across 75 nations are a part of Extinction Rebellion today. Clare Farrell, co-founder of XR, called on people everywhere to join the rebellion and “rise in peace to fight the greatest crime against humanity”, as time is of the essence. “We’ve been warned by the scientific community and experts of many kinds that humanity faces devastating impacts from a heating world and rapidly accelerating extinction rates. Rebels around the world will once again take to the streets this September because the reality is that these impacts are already here,” Farrell says. The September Rebellion will be the first coordinated international protest for the group since October 2019, when rebels worldwide staged disruptive actions that drew unprecedented attention to the threat of climate change and ecological collapse. The wave of actions will be carried out in a COVID-safe way, with small groups of disruptive rebels coming together at a safe distance. The actions will be respectful of both the current health crisis and of the fact that urgent action remains more necessary than ever if the world is to avert an even greater health, social and economic catastrophe. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that action must be taken to keep the rise in global temperatures below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels if substantial negative impacts to human communities, ecosystems and economies are to be avoided. The global rebellion comes as events continue to make it clear that the climate and ecological crisis is not only an immensely troubling future problem but a very real present one - and as governments worldwide pour trillions into COVID-19 recovery plans. “As we emerge from the pandemic, we have an opportunity to change systems for the better but the old guard is fighting for business-as-usual. We encourage everyone who can to get involved so we can tell those in power to stop vandalising our only home and instead work today to build an economy that puts our health and wellbeing first. Join the rebellion - there’s no time to waste,” Farrell says.

As a society, and as individuals, we have always been defined by how we react in the face of a crisis. This is the archetypal story played out on a global scale, presenting the opportunity for self-discovery if we are prepared to face up to the existential threat. Roger Hallam’s reputation as the eponymous ‘Troublemaker’ is a double-edged sword, praised by some and vilified by many inside and outside of Extinction Rebellion. Whatever your opinion of the man, it cannot be denied that his journey from organic farmer, to social science theorist and one-time co-founder of XR, to ‘political independent’, makes him a uniquely interesting place to start a story of ideas. This is especially true given the prevailing context of political weakness and cynicism. The film uses not one but TWO prophetic voices as channels for raising this challenge. Roger is the voice of committed belief in the civil disobedience model of social change, a model that has achieved spectacular results in recent history. But through the journey of SYLVIA DELL, retired mother of 4 from South Devon, we get a glimpse of how this model can play out in the life of an apparently ‘ordinary’, law-abiding citizen. ‘The Troublemaker’ scratches the niggling itch that is lurking in many of our brains about the extinction of planetary systems that seems to be going on all around us, and the dawning realisation that something has to be done. Ultimately the film poses a simple question: with the consensus of informed opinion declaring a ‘climate emergency’, is it morally acceptable to sit back and do nothing? SASHA SNOW “As a filmmaker I have spent the last 20 years exploring our fractured and self-destructive relationship with the natural world, looking for stories and people that might inspire us to change. I have always been interested in visionary individuals that attempt to stir society from passive acceptance and who are prepared to suffer for their ideas in the process. Between 2007-2015 I chased the ghost of GRANT HADWIN, an expert logger driven to an extreme protest and a perverse ‘crime against nature’. Grant drowned in mysterious circumstances while kayaking to his own trial. It was with the same unresolved curiosity that I approached Roger Hallam, co-founder of the then-nascent environmental protest movement ‘Extinction Rebellion’ (XR). I am an ‘outsider’ to XR, and have been careful to retain my independence, working to craft a story about the ideas and emotions that are driving the fledgling ‘rebellion’ on our streets, and not to be deflected or distracted by the personalities and politics inevitably involved with such a project. ‘The Troublemaker’ is the result of this 20 month journey, supported all the way by the editorial wisdom of the team at Passion Pictures, one of the finest independent production companies in the U.K.” With three Oscars, three BAFTAs, and numerous Emmy awards, PASSION PICTURESis a global production company with a worldwide reputation for its feature documentaries, landmark television productions, animation and commercials.

https://rebellion.global/press/2020/04/22/earth-day-2020/,"· Hundreds of stories have gone around the world describing the return of nature to silent areas where humans would dwell. · Extinction Rebellion, as part of its #LoveAndRageInTimesOfCorona campaign, has asked members from over 65 countries to describe some of these stories. · The presence of nature in cities helps provide a welcome respite from the difficult moment we are going through collectively, #AloneTogether. Wednesday April 22nd, 2020 (Global)- As our planet grapples with the Coronavirus pandemic, with over 2 million infections, hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide and a vaccine still far in the future, Extinction Rebellion activates its network, asking rebels from across the world to confirm stories of unusual sightings. With a presence in over 65 countries, the global movement is in a position to bear witness to the striking reality of silent cities. Nature, usually absent from hustle and bustle of human activity, is venturing into spaces left still by human beings. We collect some of the experiences confirmed by rebels. Our journey begins with Extinction Rebellion Uganda, where Joseph Masembe confirms how “poaching of wildlife is at its lowest, pollution of the air and water bodies is also down, and deforestation is seemingly at a standstill.” Speaking from Kampala, Flavia describes “animals and birds, until previously a rare sight on our streets and backyards, are now common. In Queen Elizabeth National Park, lions are relaxing on the road. These big cats usually hide for most of the day, but now they enjoy the sun and the warm road beneath them. They, like us, are also somehow forced to take it easy. Makes us feel not so alone, somehow.” Humans are not the only ones threatened by COVID19, points out Extinction Rebellion Congo. “Congo’s Virunga National Park, home to about a third of the world’s mountain gorillas, has closed its gates until at least June,” explains James Kataliko, following “advice from scientific experts who warn that primates, including mountain gorillas, are likely susceptible to complications arising from the COVID19 virus. It is very touching to see how humans also care for the other inhabitants of our country, threatened by the very same virus which has brought such sadness to our planet.” In South Africa, in the Western Cape town of Langebaan, “thousands of birds were seen descending onto the beach in numbers we've not seen before, going crazy over the sardines doing their yearly run along the coast, unfished by humans,” describes Nicole Collier-Naidoo from Extinction Rebellion South Africa. “There is something therapeutic about seeing life flourish in the midst of so much sadness, making us more aware of how often we take simple gifts for granted.” Speaking from Extinction Rebellion India Ajinkya Chikte, tells of how he saw dolphins swimming near Marine Drive in Mumbai. “It was amazing to see how soon into lockdown beautiful creatures we had never seen so close, approached our now silent home” explains Ajinkya. “It felt almost as if nature was showing solidarity with our collective suffering by displaying its grace and beauty, where it had been missed, to give us hope for a new tomorrow.” Further to the east, Extinction Rebellion Australia confirmed reports of kangaroo sightings deep in cities, in stark contrast to the devastation wrought on the country by the bush fires earlier this year. “It’s actually not unusual to see kangaroos on the street or in front yards of certain suburbs, but it is unusual in the middle of a capital city, as happened recently on the Sydney Harbour Bridge,” explained Larissa, spokesperson for the movement. Even in Mexico, where lockdown has come at a slower rate than other countries, residents have been subject to extraordinary sightings. Melissa Jiménez, from Extinction Rebellion Mexico, describes how “Caribbean hotels usually teeming with holidaymakers are now welcoming a different sort of guest; jaguars, leatherback turtles, great curassow birds and even crocodiles have come too explore the silence we have left behind. Maybe, when all this ends, we can find a way to coexist. in the meantime, we celebrate this natural beauty, a welcome distraction from the fear and uncertainty we are experiencing.” Walking on the beach by his home in Jaffo-Tel Aviv, Michael Raphael from Extinction Rebellion Israel recounts how he “saw a large Brown Sea Turtle and an old fisherman in Jaffa said to me as we looked in awe at it, ‘the last time I saw a turtle here was during the British mandate (1947)’”. The sample of experiences collected on this unusual and historic Earth Day serve as a testament to the planet’s resilience and act as beacon of hope, nature is encouraging us to pull through, to survive. Life will prevail as large parts of the world experience the turmoil of lockdowns. In the meantime, Extinction Rebellion will continue to strengthen and consolidate its global network of resilience to provide counsel, advice and solidarity during this shared drama, and continue to be inspired by the very life and nature we stand together and rebel for.

Our global movement stands in solidarity with all those affected by coronavirus. Extinction Rebellion (XR) welcomes the urgency with which many governments, organisations and institutions are acting in the face of the emergency represented by the Corona/Covid19 pandemic. Our current reality requires political will and quick, decisive action to mitigate, adapt and evolve to an existential threat. The movement's global network, which came together to face the Climate and Ecological Emergency, is adapting to this crisis, and hopes to be part of the force which connects people in community resilience at this time. As our ability to gather is greatly affected, each Extinction Rebellion group will consider whether it shall carry out any local activity in coming weeks and months within the context of the planned International Rebellion. The ongoing Rebellion will adapt to this situation and we expect activities around the world will vary from community aid and assistance, to simply providing connection to people. As the climate breakdown and ecological collapse continues and we see more outbreaks and pandemics, Extinction Rebellion will work to provide a growing community of compassion and care, and create spaces to put into reality how the world could be different. Now is the time to show how humans can come together and showcase other ways of existence. We must pull together as communities, protecting the most vulnerable. We must Rebel for Life.

https://rebellion.global/press/2020/02/10/oscars/,"Joaquin Phoenix used his acceptance speech after winning the Best Actor at the Oscars last night to tell the world that we urgently need to change our ways. His words struck a chord that chimes with Extinction Rebellion’s call on governments to Act Now to address the Planetary Emergency. “I think we fear the idea of personal change because we think that we have to sacrifice something, to give something up. But human beings at our best are so inventive and creative and ingenious, and I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles, we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and to the environment,” stated the award winner to a room full of Hollywood’s most influential members, with millions watching around the world. Extinction Rebellion could not agree more and takes this opportunity to congratulate Phoenix, not only for his stellar performance in both Joker and Guardians of Life, but for his courage in standing up and Telling the Truth to the world in what was one of the biggest moments of his career. The global movement is urging other notables to follow his example by Telling the Truth about the Climate and Ecological Emergency at every opportunity. In the run-up to the Academy Award ceremony, XR partnered with Amazon Watch and Mobilize Earth, to bring out a ground breaking film, Guardians of Life. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Rosario Dawson, Matthew Modine, Oona Chaplin, Adria Arjona, Albert Hammond Jr & Q’orianka Kilcher, the film urges action on the Climate and Ecological Emergency and has gone viral with millions of views within hours. “Hollywood has a moral duty to become Climate Emergency Storytellers,” says Extinction Rebellion US spokesperson Sophia Kianni, “It’s members are in a unique position to influence millions of fans around the world. Never in history have so few had the power to affect so many. The time to Act is Now. There is no Hollywood on a dead planet, Join us!” Watch the film Dr. Gail Bradbrook, Co-Founder of Extinction Rebellion, says this a sign of Hollywood beginning to use its influence to Tell the Truth about the Climate and Ecological Crisis: “There’s still a gaping hole between how bad things are and the action being taken, but that gap is narrowing. Significant people are breaking ranks, to Tell the Truth and Act as if it is real.” On the same weekend as the Award Ceremony, Extinction Rebellion LA Youth, in the company of Indigenous Leader Sônia Guajajara from APIB, converged on the Hollywood sign as part of a major climate strike and synchronized die-in. The action called on Hollywood to use their unique global platform to Tell the Truth, demanding that the Academy declare a Planetary Climate and Ecological Emergency. Extinction Rebellion will continue to build a worldwide civil disobedience movement open to all, regardless of the industry or community they belong to. After all, this is an emergency.

https://rebellion.global/press/2020/02/06/joaquin-phoenix-xr/,"Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix has unveiled his next film after Joker - a short film urging action on the Climate and Ecological Emergency, with Extinction Rebellion and Amazon Watch. Phoenix is joined in the film, entitled Guardians of Life, by an array of Hollywood stars including Rosario Dawson, Matthew Modine, Q'orianka Kilcher, Oona Chaplin, Adria Arjona, and Albert Hammond Jr. of The Strokes. The 2 minute short film, set in an Emergency Room, launches a new campaign to engage the public in different aspects of the Climate and Ecological Emergency. It acts as a Public Service Announcement (PSA) for the plight of the Amazon and its indigenous communities, and an alarm call for deforestation and biodiversity loss taking place in every corner of the globe, as a result of devastating wildfires, droughts, floods and storms. The involvement of Joaquin Phoenix comes as no surprise, given his history of activism. Phoenix was recently arrested at a protest organised by the actress Jane Fonda in Washington DC, where he spoke about the link between climate change and animal agriculture. Commenting on the film Phoenix said: “It’s really a call to action. I did it to raise awareness about the meat and dairy industry’s effect on climate change. The fact is we are clear cutting and burning rainforests and seeing the negative effects of those actions worldwide. People don’t realize there’s still time, but only if we act now and make sweeping changes to our consumption. We can’t wait for governments to solve these problems for us. We can’t wait until the election to try to make these changes. We have a personal responsibility to make changes in our own lives and act now."" Shaun Monson, the film’s Director, said he felt compelled to make the film as previous documentary style PSAs had failed to move audiences to take action: “so instead of focusing on deforestation, ice melting and species extinction, we use a story as a metaphor. The Amazon has been called the lungs of the world, or the heart of the world, but instead of documentary footage we proposed an ER setting with doctors and nurses trying to save an unseen patient with systemic heart failure. The twist is not only who one of the paramedics is, but what they were really fighting to save all along.” Leila Salazar-López of Amazon Watch believes the film is an example of art reflecting life: “An indigenous woman saving the Amazon is not a metaphor: it is a daily reality as the rainforest is razed and indigenous lands are invaded for profit. The Amazon rainforest is the heart of our world, and indigenous forest guardians are central to its well-being and to our collective future.” Sônia Guajajara, Executive Coordinator of the Articulation of Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples (APIB) said: “This film is very important for us at this moment. It demonstrates the artists' engagement in Amazon protection by showing the key role indigenous peoples play in defending the forests, the planet, and life itself.” The film is the first of a twelve-part series planned by Extinction Rebellion, in collaboration with Mobilize Earth. Each will tell a story about the most pressing issues facing the human species as we move into what most scientists, politicians and the public see as the make or break decade for the survival of life on the planet. For Matthew Modine, one of the film’s stars, the Climate and Ecological Emergency means: “children inheriting a world unrecognizable to the one I was born into … this PSA is one way of opening people’s eyes to see what is actually happening right in front of us.” Gail Bradbrook, Co-Founder of Extinction Rebellion, hopes that this is one of the first signs of Hollywood beginning to use its influence to tell the truth about the gravity of the Climate and Ecological Crisis: “There is still a disconnect between how bad things are and the action that needs to happen. But that gap is narrowing. There are more significant people starting to break ranks, to tell the truth and act as if it is real.” The film’s female lead, Q’orianka Kilcher said: “As an indigenous actress I feel a strong responsibility to use my public platform to help amplify the voices who are seldom heard including all the indigenous defenders around the world who are the protectors of our Mother Earth, the Amazon Rainforest, and all the biodiversity and animals.” Jonathan Mintram, the Executive Producer, was keen to stress that: “This film features fires in the Amazon and Australia, but we must not forget the other devastating fires from Angola and The Congo to Siberia and California.” The funding for the film has come from a variety of organisations including the UK-based Catalysts Foundation, as well as the global Climate Save Movement. The website for the film www.mobilize.earth aims to raise awareness, action and donations, which will go towards the work of Amazon Watch and Extinction Rebellion. Additional supporters include the Artists for the Amazon campaign, and Environmental Media Association. The next film in the 12-part series will deal with the topic of denial, asking why we as a species choose to ignore the warning signs rather than deciding to act now on the Climate & Ecological Emergency.

https://rebellion.global/press/2020/01/22/spain-climate-emergency/,"Extinction Rebellion on Spain’s declaring a Climate and Environmental Emergency: ""Good, but not enough. Let’s carry on"" The declaration approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers takes a substantial step towards fulfilling two of them: firstly, the truth must be told regarding the climate and ecological emergency, and; the third, the creation of citizens' assemblies to guide the process through representative participation. Time is of the essence. The trigger for this political change has been the broad mobilization of citizens who have taken to the streets to demand political leaders keep us off ""a suicidal path for humanity,"" as UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has referred to our current situation. Extinction Rebellion has been at the heart of this shift in the global conversation, placing the climate and ecological emergency at the heart of it. Building bridges and cooperating with different groups and institutions, XR has been in large part responsible for the massive response to government and corporate inaction, using peaceful mass civil disobedience as its primary vehicle. Taking advantage of the celebration of COP25 in Madrid, XR pressured the UN climate summit’s host with the help of ordinary citizens, which led it to become recognized as the most influential movement of the moment. The decision taken by the Spanish government ratifies the fight for life Extinction Rebellion has embarked upon across the globe. XR demands more ambitious and concrete measures: the deadline is 2025 Given the deadlines announced by the new government, XR calls for the need to implement more ambitious decarbonisation targets. The scientific community, in the latest IPCC report (2018), warns of how crucial it is not to overstep a 1.5ºC rise in global temperatures this century. This implies a drastic reduction in our emissions by 2030. With scientific data in hand, XR urges the Spanish government to deepen the decisive green about-turn it seems to be taking, by integrating deadlines set by science, as well as the biophysical limits of the planet, along with the measures already announced. The global community must recognize how absurd it is for infinite growth to be a measure of success on a planet with limited resources. We are still in time, just, to avoid a societal and ecological collapse. Citizen participation and real climate justice Extinction Rebellion welcomes Spain’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera’s, advancement of urgent steps needed to ensure a wide and inclusive participation of Spanish citizens who have a crucial role to play in determining their collective future in light of the climate and ecological emergency’s onslaught. Only citizen’s assemblies have the ability to make this a reality. Citizens must be empowered to participate directly and effectively in national decision-making, guaranteed by XR’s third demand. The recent example of the Convention citoyenne pour le climat, initiated in France, is a dire warning of the risks citizens' assemblies face if converted into workshops and debate forums with no teeth. In light of this, XRSpain will work towards ensuring the effectiveness of the promised Citizens' Assembly. The demographically representative participation of citizens through sortition, is a key aspect of the unprecedented social mutations needed to face the climate and ecological crisis. Citizens must understand the reality of the situation through a process of deliberation and participate in the required changes, while monitoring the veracity of political action implementation. Nothing less will suffice in dealing with the biggest threat ever faced by humanity. During the coming months, the Spanish government will have to take concrete actions, including the approval of the European Union’s National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC). As such, it must demonstrate its commitment to mitigating and adapting to the climate and ecological emergency. Spain is on the cusp of becoming a regional, and even global, leader. Extinction Rebellion challenges Spain to step up and rise to the occasion. Meanwhile, and until this has been achieved, the global movement will continue to mobilize and scale up the impact of its actions, in order to ensure carbon emission cuts are in line with the science. There simply is no other way to safeguard the future of all life on Earth.

People demand that the Australian Government acts now to avoid more devastation and ultimately, extinction and that companies stop putting profit first January 16th, 2020 (Australia, Germany, India) - As Australia suffers devastating bushfires, Extinction Rebellion (XR) climate activists in over 35 countries are holding solidarity actions with Extinction Rebellion Australia’s Bushfire Rebellion outside Australian embassies and consulates for the second week in a row. Countries, including Nigeria, Zambia, Netherlands, Argentina, Uganda and Spain. Extinction Rebellion India, meanwhile, has been warned by local police not to protest. The borderless, nonviolent rebellion comes in response to the Australian government’s climate inaction and exacerbation of the climate crisis which has led to the catastrophic bushfire crisis. The catastrophic mega blaze has already led to what scientists are describing as an ecosystem and species apocalypse in Australia. Some estimates state that up to 700 animal species have had their populations decimated - with many species likely to be pushed to extinction including the Long-footed potaroo, the Greater glider, the Kangaroo Island dunnart, and the Black-tailed dusky antechinus, being obliterated from the face of the Earth. “It would seem the only people willing to dismiss the scientific correlation between the bushfire crisis and the climate crisis are those massaged by the fossil fuel industry in the Australian government and those who believe the propaganda of fossil fuel-interested media,” said Extinction Rebellion Sydney spokesperson Larissa Payne. While we are on the verge of triggering a climatic point of no return, German company Siemens agreed to participate in the development of the world's largest coal mine. Siemens will supply the signage technology for the railway line of the Carmichael coal mine in Galilee Basin, Australia, quite literally signaling the way to the destruction of life on the Planet. “Instead of demonstrating climate leadership and turning its back on one of the many culprits, it chooses to of quite literally fuel fires around the world, despite warnings from several environmental groups, ongoing protests, and over 60 companies pulling out of the project. Siemens undoubtedly places profit over the planet,” explains XR Germany spokesperson Annemarie Botski. Meanwhile, companies from around the world display similar callousness for life on Earth, even as the island continent’s species go extinct, “In the same line, the Adani business group has obtained approvals for extracting coal from the Carmichael coal mines in Australia. Fighting to saving our planet has rightly turned global because the impact of forest fires in Brazil, floods in Indonesia or fires in Australia are already being felt all across our Earth. Such tragedies will only increase in intensity and in terms of numbers,” says Extinction Rebellion India’s Jeevesh Gupta. “It is believed several animal and plant species have been rendered extinct in the past few weeks. An estimated over half a billion animals have died in this disaster. Much of the severity of conditions in the southern parts of Australia can be attributed to massive amounts of land clearing in the past century, leading to loss of rainfall, and no consultation or respect by governments of the original Australians’ intact knowledge of caring for and maintaining the land,” laments Australian First Nation spiritual leader Nick Tree. The fires sweeping the country have also pumped out an estimated 400 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, further fueling climate change that has already intensified Australia’s devastating fires. The is equivalent to the total combined annual emissions of 116 low-emitting countries and nine times the amount of carbon produced during California’s record-setting 2018 fire season. “The climate crisis cares nothing for borders. We need coordinated, international action to combat this mess. The Bushfire Rebellion is only the beginning. Two thirds of Australians want the government to declare a climate emergency and mobilize at World-war scale.

https://rebellion.global/press/2019/12/30/xr-2019/,"December 31st, 2019, (Planet Earth) - When a group of ordinary citizens, inspired by scientists, agreed to set-out on an outrageous idea with great expectations back in April 2018, never could they have imagined the impact their experiment would have across our planet. Gravely aware of how society has failed to cope with the worst existential crisis humanity has ever collectively faced, the notion was to finally take charge in an issue negligently ignored by the governments of the world, by creating the largest climate related civil disobedience movement in history. As 2019 draws to a close, Extinction Rebellion (XR) pauses to look back on some of the year’s milestones. The global movement defined by its nonviolent civil disobedience continues to revolve around three basic demands, adapted to local realities: To disseminate and deliver their demands, XR organized two international rebellions, in April and in October. The April rebellion took London by storm, breaking through citizen’s indifference, as rebels came out to celebrate life in the heart of the British capital for two solid weeks. XR groups made their global debut in Buenos Aires, Paris, Buenos Aires and Sydney, to name a few places. Actions resulted in thousands of arrests, generated economic losses in the millions and even moved the British Parliament to declare a climate emergency - the first legislative body in the world to do so. Extinction Rebellion had single handedly shifted the conversation and forced the world to talk about the climate and ecological emergency. The rest is history, as the rebellion spread to the farthest shores. From France to Germany, South Africa, Ghana, India, New Zealand to Chile, XR’s stylized hourglass, flew over Earth’s most unexpected corners, with the exception of a single continent: Antarctica. For now. Day by day, rebels around the planet wove alliances, be it with established environmental organisations, such as Greenpeace, or new movements like Fridays for Future. Crucially though, it reaches out to diverse sectors of civil society and especially, to people. “The climate and ecological emergency knows no borders,” explains 23 year-old Dutch student Pippi Van Ommen, ""if the sea level rises up by two meters, my hometown, and much of my country will not survive. I was not an activist before. I heard about Extinction Rebellion through Instagram and now I dedicate all my time, despite having had to hand in my thesis over Christmas. XR is not right or left. It represents all social sectors and age groups, there is no hierarchy and everyone is welcome."" One of the most iconic images was a call to “Rebel for Life”, emblazoned across pink and yellow ships, moored across the world’s major cities, in the middle of the street. “We are all in the same boat” is the message it embodies, launching it into the public’s and rebels’ imaginations alike, as it rides the cusp of the global Climate Spring’s wave. Described by CNN as “the world's most high-profile environmental movement,” Extinction Rebellion is different. It is radically different, being a movement of engineers, doctors, unemployed, retired, students, scientists, journalists ... in short, it is a movement of ordinary, or rather, extraordinary, normal, humans. ""XR uses civil disobedience to shake consciences in the face of the climate crisis. It is a group bursting with energy. It appeals to emotions. To a vision of a destroyed future if we don't act,"" explains Egbert Born, a 53-year-old poet from Amsterdam. Adelheid Lüchtrath, a 67-year-old German doctor, summarizes her year explaining how she had “never been arrested, nor fined, but would be willing to spend time in jail, if it helps the climate struggle. I’ve been fighting climate change for 40 years because politicians have done nothing. They do not want to react."" Across the world, XR has met with politicians and governments. A grandmother who went on hunger strike in November in protest at climate change met with Irish Environment minister, Richard Bruton. In Spain, XR met with Ecological Transition minister, Teresa Ribera, as well as with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, while Sweden’s environment minister agreed to meet with Swedish hunger strikers. In the United States hunger strikers occupied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Capitol office. During COP25, the UN’s 25th yearly climate summit, the movement has cemented its reputation as a serious player at the political table. Despite a last-minute shift to Madrid from Santiago de Chile following social unrest, the global movement made itself felt. Inside, co-founder Skeena Rathor and UK coordinator Tim Crosland met with the presidency and looked towards COP26 in Glasgow, highlighting the need for authentic cooperation and unity in the face of adversity. Outside, XR’s Rebels without Borders, from over 20 countries, manifested through civil disobedience (and discobedience) their outrage every day, culminating with a pile of horse manure delivered to the UN climate summit’s door step. The message attached read: “Dear Leaders…The Horseshit stops here.” A few days later social media analytics company, Onolytica, ranked XR as COP 25’s number one influencer. Despite all this, emissions continue to rise and the COP25 Christmas pantomime proved hopelessly inadequate at setting any significant change in motion, kicking the can down the road to COP26 in Glasgow. Where Extinction Rebellion will most certainly be in attendance. For all of us at XR, 2019 has represented the year in which we delivered a cosmic climate and ecological wake-up call. We will continue to Rebel for Life, bringing our compassionate revolution to every last continent. Time is running out and Extinction Rebellion will remain at the frontlines of the planetary emergency, an engine of change in a withering world.

Extinction Rebellion reminds leaders they cannot flee the climate and ecological emergency Civil disobedience and direct nonviolent actions coordinated by global rebels will fill Madrid’s streets and squares December 2nd, Madrid (SPAIN) – Rebels from as many as 19 different nations and all walks of life descended upon the Spanish capital to deliver an Ultimatum to the global community as representatives gather for the 25th edition of the Conference of the Parties (COP), the United Nations’ (UN) yearly climate summit. Extinction Rebellion (XR) members have arrived to remind world leaders and citizens alike, while the conference could avoid the “inconvenience” of Chile’s social unrest, they cannot avoid the “inconvenience” of the climate and ecological crisis. Madrid’s COP25 represents a true ultimatum for humankind and all ecosystems: time has all but run out to avert the worst of the catastrophe our planet faces. In the face of such unimaginable carnage, which scientists have been warning about for over four decades, the only viable option is for a massive, peaceful and democratic mobilization. The complexity surrounding the cause and impacts of the crisis requires not just individual action, but large-scale nonviolent mobilization to demand immediate change. Climate Rebels from around the world descend upon Madrid Extinction Rebellion Spain will be hosting rebels from as many as 19 countries and six continents, as part of the global contributions of XR groups from local national and international circles who contribute all around the world. Rebels for life will fill the streets, crowd Madrid’s plazas, inviting onlookers to join the rebellion for life, as other capitals act in solidarity. Through artistic, symbolic, disruptive actions, activists will take up song and dance in the struggle for our children’s future, our ecosystem and our natural treasures, sacrificed at the altar of unencumbered, unsustainable growth. By claiming back the streets, XR reiterates its global message of a democratic defense of the common good made visible and within anybody’s reach. A brave few will not do, life is everybody’s cause. While COP25 gets underway, XR groups around the world have gathered under the same messages and three shared demands for the gathering leaders 1) Tell the truth about the climate and ecological emergency, highlighting scientific data on the reality we find ourselves in. 2) Immediate action is required through the implementation of policies to bring down greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. 3) Inclusive democracy through Citizen’s assemblies, comprised of truly representative members selected through sortition, to make informed recommendations following deliberation. Planet Earth’s citizens are increasingly aware, time is of the essence, underscored by a year of globally coordinated demonstrations and rebellions. At the same time, citizens of nations across the world are beginning to manifest themselves against increasingly perceivable local injustices. From Hong Kong, through France to Colombia, people’s discomfort with the status quo is becoming ever evident. COP25, originally to be hosted by Brazil, was moved from Santiago to Madrid due to the uncertainty posed by social protests. However, these social protests are merely the beginning of societal collapse triggered by an unsustainable global system so toxic the environment is on the verge of absolute collapse. The climate crisis is not just ecological. It is social, economic and cultural, and COP25 is just its latest refugee. The COP, 25 years sounding a muted alarm Now, in the midst of the first truly global humanitarian crisis, and 24 years on from the first COP, the summit’s cause has become more crucial than ever. Yet global commitment is criminally absent. Goals set out by previous COPs, including Paris’ COP 21 celebrated agreement, and ignored in a stubborn and suicidal pursuit of business as usual. A mere 16 countries out of the 195 which signed the Paris Agreement are complying with it. Meanwhile, the Amazon, Siberia, the Arctic and Koalas burn. The last 30 have been more disastrous than the two previous centuries: 60% of the world’s species are endangered and we are on course for a 3oC global temperature rise, according to 2018’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. These glaring facts shed light on the effect of these conferences. COP25 represents a final chance, an ultimatum, for leaders to take responsibility and activate mechanisms on a global scale to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. By Glasgow’s COP26, serious inroads need to have been made if we even stand a chance to address even the IPCC’s predictions. The time to make bold and brave choices is now. And a bold and brave movement of people from around the world will remind its leaders that failure is not an option we are willing to accept.

https://rebellion.global/press/2019/12/02/discobedience-goes-global/,"Saturday, December 7, 2019 (Madrid, SPAIN) – Members of Extinction Rebellion (XR), coming from more than 20 countries, blocked the street of Gran Vía with their dance moves to “Staying Alive” as part of an action held across 23 cities around the world, starting in Bali, Indonesia and many other cities(Paris, Amsterdam, Sydney, New York, etc.). ""Civil-discobedience"" is the latest artistic expression of the social movement that aims to mobilize society to cope with the ravages of climate change and defend life on the planet. This action echoes the quote attributed to feminist activist Emma Goldman, ""If I can’t dance, it’s not my revolution."" This action aims to highlight that the climate and ecological crisis is a global phenomenon that requires joint and coordinated action from civil society, worldwide. Rebels from all countries and continents show that civil society, unlike political and economic elites, can build agreements that focus on what is most important, that crosses borders and supports the regions most affected by this crisis. There is no time for hope, it is time for action. Therefore, civil disobedience actions must be inclusive, creating participatory environments where everyone can feel comfortable and cared for. That is exactly what «civil-discobedience» does: rebellion at the blow of the hips. Inspired by an action by XR Australia, hundreds of XR rebels from all over the world gathered in Madrid to exert pressure on COP 25 and invited others to participate in a spontaneous dance, breaking into the streets and squares of the world to the sound of the disco music, so that life lasts, emphasizing the message of the BeeGees: «Staying alive.» We need to stay alive. In Madrid, the musical styles were representative of various across the world. At the beginning of COP25, XR announced its intention to bring art, music and rebellion to the streets of Madrid and the world as part of a call to citizens to unite around 3 demands: Using art, culture and peaceful civil disobedience, XR protests are without violence every day since the inauguration of the international summit, to demand a democratic defence of the common good and the right to life for future generations. Through this global party, to which everyone is invited, XR takes another step in its mission to protect and celebrate life on the planet through beauty and joy. # ULTIMATUMCOP25 Mail: comunicacion@extinctionrebellion.es Web: https://www.extinctionrebellion.es share Extinction Rebellion is a decentralised, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.
